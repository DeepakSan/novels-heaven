Last night everything had seemed normal, but now, stepping outside, the streets were adorned with festive decorations in a sea of red.<br/><br/>The entire Imperial Capital was draped in red silk, red “happiness” characters, and red lanterns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everywhere you looked, there was a feeling of great joy.<br/><br/>Even all the advertisement spaces in shopping malls and skyscrapers had removed their original ads and replaced them with the double happiness (“囍”) character.<br/><br/>[Whose wedding has taken over the entire Imperial Capital? Holy cow! This is the Imperial Capital, where an inch of land is worth its weight in gold! Not just some village! Won’t they go bankrupt?]<br/><br/>[Who could be that extravagant? Do you know how much it costs to occupy those advertising spaces in a building? Someone did it! They took them all. The key is...he just put up a single happiness character.]<br/><br/>[A friend told me that the red silk decorations even reached the suburbs.]<br/><br/>[But yesterday evening before I went to bed, there was nothing. This speed, not to mention the money, how many people must have been involved!]<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Where’s the lipstick?” Hill Dawson looked for the lipstick.<br/><br/>Olivia Lane helped out.<br/><br/>Serena Buster helped her adjust the hem of the skirt while Stella Edwards stood by the door asking, “Should we block it somehow? Are they going to kick the door down?”<br/><br/>“It’s fine,” Logan said, “As long as Big Boss is there, they won’t dare.”<br/><br/>As soon as his voice trailed off, noisy voices could be heard from outside.<br/><br/>Upon hearing that sound...<br/><br/>Everyone except for Charlotte rushed to the balcony to look down.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark, dressed in a matching red dragon and phoenix gown, walked at the front.<br/><br/>Behind him were dozens of men also dressed in red robes.<br/><br/>Following Kevin were Hugo Clark and Xavier Dominic, then Yoshua Archer and Edward Darkmoon, and finally, the seven gossiping friends, excluding Alfie Ward.<br/><br/>Captain Mason and the 12th Hall Master were even further back in line.<br/><br/>Aside from Kevin Clark at the front, the men behind him...seemed like a group of monkeys in the mountains.<br/><br/>Jumping and hopping about, they waved something in their hands and yelled loudly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even Hugo Clark joined in the spectacle, waving his hand half-heartedly.<br/><br/>“This looks like a large-scale display of human atavism,” Robinson Scott remarked sarcastically.<br/><br/>“This is the first time I’ve seen Kevin Clark not object to this,” Siera Santiago commented.<br/><br/>Damian Brown said, “Men will be boys until they die; this is indeed true.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
