But it seems even quieter at this time.<br/><br/>There’s no one else in the corridor except them.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane stands in place, her eyes reflecting the images of the two of them, but her mind is full of that figure.<br/><br/>It looks so much like him<br/><br/>Especially that slow stride.<br/><br/>Mrs. Davis was still saying, “Our future daughter-in-law and mistress of the Davis Residence must come from a family like the Lane Family.”<br/><br/>Hearing the words “Lane Family,” Daisy Zane snaps back to reality.<br/><br/>Mrs. Davis continues, “My future daughter-in-law must be like Young Miss Lane. She should come from a good background and be well-cultured. She should have proper manners and the grace of a true aristocratic lady. Absolutely not a wild girl who flaunts herself in public.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane glances at Mrs. Davis and then at Amelia Miles.<br/><br/>She understands why they were together here.<br/><br/>The dance competition starts next Monday.<br/><br/>According to online analysis, Amelia Miles has a high chance of joining the Dance Association. Even some people think that based on Sophie Ortiz’s preferences, Amelia Miles has a nearly 50% chance of becoming Sophie Ortiz’s apprentice.<br/><br/>After all, Amelia is known as “Little Kiara” outside.Th.ê most uptodate novels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m<br/><br/>If Amelia becomes Sophie Ortiz’s apprentice,<br/><br/>Daisy Zane glances at Amelia’s face before releasing Mrs. Davis abruptly once more.<br/><br/>She uses so much force that Mrs. Davis not only slams into the wall but also twists her ankle. The pain turns her face as white as a sheet.<br/><br/>Amelia watches this scene and, after looking at the surveillance camera overhead, she subtly curls the corner of her lip in satisfaction.<br/><br/>This is a big news story, enough to force someone to retire from the circle.<br/><br/>“Show some sense and stay away from Olivia Lane,” Daisy Zane says coldly.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane has barely finished speaking when she hears footsteps behind her.<br/><br/>She turns to look.<br/><br/>Arthur North approaches with a group of people.<br/><br/>Arthur North is still wearing the black shirt and trousers he wore this morning. His pace is fast and his strides are long.<br/><br/>His thin, crimson lips are pursed with concern.<br/><br/>His narrow eyes seem to be brewing a storm.<br/><br/>Mysterious, demonic, and regal.<br/><br/>Seeing him, the gloom in Daisy Zane’s heart subsides a little, and the fire that hasn’t been let out is extinguished slightly.<br/><br/>Watching the man approaching, Amelia’s eyes suddenly tighten and she unconsciously shifts towards the side.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Mrs. Davis leans against the wall, her foot not daring to touch the ground, her face pale as she watches the distinguished man approach.<br/><br/>Arthur North strides up to Daisy Zane, looks down at her, then reaches out and touches her face gently, “Why does your complexion look so terrible?”<br/><br/>Twisting her fingertips, Daisy Zane replies, “It’s nothing.
