When she passed by a room entrance, she inadvertently caught a glimpse of the door lock.<br/><br/>It was a password lock in the shape of a rose, with numbers scattered on its petals.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane suddenly stopped in her tracks and inexplicably approached the password lock.<br/><br/>At the same time, a thought flashed through her mind: “Dad and Mom, I designed this password lock for the room. Is my design good enough?”<br/><br/>The moment the thought crossed her mind, Daisy Zane remembered a series of numbers.<br/><br/>She hesitated for a moment, raised her hand, and touched the password lock. Then she lightly pressed the numbers one by one: 010005<br/><br/>She pressed the pound key, and the door to the room opened with a click.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s eyelashes trembled fiercely.<br/><br/>She...<br/><br/>Daisy Zane stood at the entrance, looking at the door, her breath tightened. She didn’t even hear the sound of the elevator door opening.<br/><br/>The chaos in her head seemed to intensify, yet at the same time became clearer.<br/><br/>Ever since Kevin Clark hypnotized her, she had been having dreams every night. Some were happy, some were sad.<br/><br/>However, she would forget them as soon as she awoke.<br/><br/>As a result, her head was always in a muddle, as if she was surrounded by a fog that refused to dissipate.<br/><br/>But now...<br/><br/>She took a deep breath, placed her hand on the door, and pushed it open.<br/><br/>Just as she was about to step inside, her right wrist was suddenly grabbed.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane eyed the sudden redness in his eyes and the moisture building up. She gently furrowed her brows.<br/><br/>Just as she was about to say something, she saw Kevin Clark hurrying over, followed by the trotting Olivia Lane.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane watched Kevin Clark swiftly come in front of them, grab William Lane’s hand, and speak in a deep voice: “Roy Madison, let go!”<br/><br/>William Lane didn’t move, just continued to stare at Daisy Zane.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked back at him. He was William Lane, the Young Master of the Lane Family.<br/><br/>Olivia Lane also ran over, panting as she tugged at William Lane’s clothes, saying, “Brother, brother, let go. Let go. She didn’t come up on purpose. She thought I was in danger. Brother.”<br/><br/>William Lane did not let go, so Kevin Clark forcefully pried his hand open.<br/><br/>But as soon as they were separated, William Lane wanted to grab Daisy Zane’s hand again.<br/><br/>The man seemed agitated, as if fearful of losing sight of her the moment he let go.<br/><br/>As if everything that just happened would turn into an illusion.<br/><br/>However, Kevin Clark didn’t allow him to touch Daisy Zane, blocking her and saying, “Roy Madison, don’t go too far.”<br/><br/>After finishing his words, he immediately checked Daisy Zane’s red wrist and glared at William Lane, saying coldly, “William Lane, it was My Lady who thought your sister was in danger and came up. You...”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane tugged at him, and Kevin Clark didn’t finish his sentence.<br/><br/>While he still didn’t want to see William Lane, he led Daisy Zane away.<br/><br/>William Lane’s gaze immediately followed Daisy Zane.<br/><br/>He even mechanically chased after her for a couple of steps like a robot, but was stopped by Olivia Lane.<br/><br/>Olivia Lane hugged his arm and dragged him, saying, “Brother, she really didn’t come up on purpose. I can explain, don’t be angry.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
