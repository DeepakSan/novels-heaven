The woman leaned against the door, looking indifferently at the man in front of her.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark held Charlotte Lane’s shoulder with one hand, propped the door with the other, and looked down at her.<br/><br/>The two stared at each other, then Kevin Clark asked softly, “What were you just looking at?”<br/><br/>“What was I looking at?” Charlotte Lane retorted, “Didn’t you observe what I noticed?”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark: “......”<br/><br/>“So the women by Third Master’s side are always so beautiful huh?” There was no emotion discernible in Charlotte Lane’s voice, still nonchalant and cold. “Third Master is quite fortunate.”<br/><br/>With a hand on her chin, Kevin Clark commented, “Indeed I am, being married.”<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane laughed lightly, “How did you meet?”<br/><br/>“We learned piano together when we were young.”<br/><br/>“Childhood...” Charlotte Lane didn’t finish her sentence because she was interrupted by a kiss from Kevin Clark.<br/><br/>With a gentle smile, Kevin Clark watched her, “I was asking you, how did you turn the tables so quickly?”<br/><br/>“What are you asking me for?” Charlotte Lane said, “I just find it funny how you can even be jealous of a woman.”<br/><br/>“What’s wrong with women?” Kevin Clark said, “Logan’s gaze towards you isn’t innocent. She even fought me because of you.”<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane: “......”<br/><br/>When she suddenly fell silent, Kevin Clark squinted slightly, “Little Girl, what kind of reaction is that?”<br/><br/>“If I had such intentions, you wouldn’t be in the picture now,” Charlotte Lane said.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark chuckled, then said, “I know, I hold the top spot in your heart, Little Girl.”<br/><br/>“Third Master, tone down your narcissism.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark bent over to kiss her lips twice, then continued, “Her name is Caroline Quinn. She should be younger than me, but she became an apprentice earlier, so technically, she is my senior. However... we aren’t really close. We didn’t interact much during our piano practice. After I stopped practicing as much, we lost contact.”<br/><br/>Caroline Quinn...” repeated Charlotte Lane, “Third Master... the way she looks at you doesn’t seem very innocent.”<br/><br/>“You’re mistaken,” Kevin Clark said.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane gave a light whistle.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark: “......”<br/><br/>Standing straight, Charlotte Lane pushed back lightly on Kevin Clark’s shoulder, opened the door, and said, “Let’s go.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark exited the room with her, and as they walked, he asked, “Little Girl, why are you so nonchalant?”<br/><br/>“What kind of reaction are you expecting from me, to blow up Court Music Academy?” Charlotte Lane retorted.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark: “......”<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>She didn’t look over, just listening quietly.<br/><br/>However, standing next to her, Charles was always looking at Caroline Quinn, and that little expression... seemed to be quite enchanted.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane didn’t really listen to what Alex Justin and his group were saying, she was just listening to the piano music.<br/><br/>Then Alex Justin suddenly took Kevin Clark to walk towards the right side.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark was holding onto Charlotte Lane’s hand the whole time, so he also moved her to the right.<br/><br/>Nearer to the piano, but Kevin Clark blocked her view.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane: “......”<br/><br/>Originally, Charlotte Lane was listening to the piano quite attentively, without any intention to look over.<br/><br/>But him blocking like this...<br/><br/>A rebellious psychology sprang up, she didn’t want to procrastinate any longer. Charlotte Lane stepped back and turned her head to look at Caroline Quinn.<br/><br/>Caroline Quinn had just lifted her head, their gaze met.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane’s expression was very light, very cool. Those phoenix eyes, when looking at someone, naturally exuded a cold sensation.<br/><br/>Caroline Quinn was taken aback for a moment, silently admiring her beauty, then she nodded and smiled at her.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane acknowledged with a little nod.<br/><br/>The sound of Caroline Quinn’s piano stopped.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark had just tried to pull her back, when he was planning to step back to block her view again.<br/><br/>Caroline Quinn suddenly spoke out, “Mrs. Clark, I heard that you play piano very well, would you honor me with a comparison?”<br/><br/>The mingling sound of various instruments and conversations was rather noisy,<br/><br/>Caroline Quinn’s voice was somewhat loud.<br/><br/>So, the people around quickly looked over.<br/><br/>To people outside the circle, and even many within the circle, didn’t know much about Caroline Quinn.<br/><br/>But at the top of this circle, everyone knew Caroline Quinn.<br/><br/>Not for anything else, but for her excellent piano playing.<br/><br/>Caroline Quinn almost never performed, but she had a hobby, she liked to “compare” everywhere.<br/><br/>She even competed with many Grand Masters and pianists.<br/><br/>So, at the top of the circle, everyone knew her. Some even admired her.<br/><br/>Also, because of this, the people she wanted to compete with were all very impressive.<br/><br/>So, everyone’s attention quickly shifted to this Mrs. Clark.<br/><br/>There are always greater people beyond. Sometimes, the more advanced a person is, the more they like to hide from the world.<br/><br/>Everyone immediately thought that this Mrs. Clark is a piano Grand Master, and their expectations shot up instantly.<br/><br/>Celeste Martin had been observing the situation here, seeing everyone looking at Daisy Zane, she raised the corner of her mouth slightly.<br/><br/>Then she started walking towards them...\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
