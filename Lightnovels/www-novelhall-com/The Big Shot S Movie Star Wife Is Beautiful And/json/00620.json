What about her?<br/><br/>Indeed, only her world of embarrassment was achieved.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane’s body felt achy and sore, even lifting her arm hurt.<br/><br/>Back when she trained on the M Continent, she might not have ever felt this awful.<br/><br/>She thought about it, it was indeed worse on the M Continent.<br/><br/>Since she was already late and the damage had been done, Charlotte Lane decided to stay in bed and check her phone messages.<br/><br/>Hill Dawson, Anisa Cooper, Gentry Morris and numerous others from the “Hope” crew had texted her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The award hasn’t been won yet.” Charlotte pushed his face away, “Go away, don’t kiss me.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark held her hand, gently squeezing it: “Are you still angry? Didn’t I took good care of you last night?”<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane gave him a look, ignoring him.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark touched the ring on her ring finger: “Next time, I will lie down, and Madam can do whatever she wants.”<br/><br/>“Wanting comfort without putting in effort.” Charlotte Lane shook her chin she was resting on her palm, “Third Master, that’s not how you get a bargain.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark laughed pretending to pout. After a while, he suddenly said, “We should get a new ring.”<br/><br/>“Hmm?”<br/><br/>“Let’s get a prettier one.”<br/><br/>“Okay.” Charlotte Lane said, “Our Third Master is rich.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane kept a close eye on the Golden Queen Award after the nominations were announced.<br/><br/>But remarkably, on the award day, the day the winner of Best Leading Actress was about to be announced, Charlotte Lane could not leave the laboratory at the research institute.<br/><br/>She and Kevin Clark had not returned home for a week, constantly in the lab, they spent the nights at the institute’s dormitory.<br/><br/>But no matter how much they rushed, they couldn’t get out that night.<br/><br/>The duo, engrossed in their experiment, were out of touch with the outside world.<br/><br/>It was only after they had worked through the night, when they left the laboratory in the early morning the next day, that they had time to look up the news online.<br/><br/>At the 56th Golden Queen Awards, Gentry Morris won Best Director, George Dunn won Best Actor, Flynn Ninevara won Best Screenwriter.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane won Best Leading Actress.<br/><br/>After the nominations were announced, they had asked Charlotte Lane if she wanted to change her name to Charlotte Lane.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
