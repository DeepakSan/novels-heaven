Not only is she beautiful, but her marksmanship is also impressive.” People around Bonnie Maxwell were amazed, completely ignoring her reaction. <br/><br/>They went on praising, “Marksmanship that can match Third Master’s is indeed nothing short of divine presence.” <br/><br/>Bonnie’s hand that hung by her side clenched tightly, the veins on the back of her hand bulging. Even her jawline tightened from biting her teeth. <br/><br/>She never expected that this woman... this woman was so good at using a gun. <br/><br/>How could it be, how is it possible. <br/><br/>How could a wild girl from the countryside have such marksmanship. <br/><br/>“Indeed, excellent people should be with other excellent people,” someone beside her said. “They truly are a perfect match.” <br/><br/>Bonnie suddenly looked at the person beside her, her eyes seemingly reddened by jealousy, radiating endless malice. Her voice was restrained to the point of being stiff and hoarse, “Do you have nothing else to do?” <br/><br/>The person beside her was startled, instinctively taking a step back, somewhat baffled. They had just been fine, but now she was like this. <br/><br/>He didn’t investigate further, merely giving her another puzzled glance before saying, “Commander asked me to call Kevin Clark and Arthur North, I’ll go first. <br/><br/>Bonnie wanted to respond, but her throat was too dry and painful, she couldn’t utter a sound, she could only watch the person walk away. VIsit n0(v)eLb(i)n.com for the best novel reading experience<br/><br/>She stood there, taking deep breaths to adjust her emotions. <br/><br/>She watched the person who had just been standing beside her, calling Kevin Clark and Arthur North. <br/><br/>She watched Kevin Clark, Arthur North, and Allonzo Hobson leave together. <br/><br/>Before leaving, Kevin Clark caressed Daisy Zane’s face, talked to Michael Jackson and Juan Wright for a while, and then left. <br/><br/>So, one day... the man who had no room for women in his heart would also be so tender towards a woman, showering her with love, caring, adoration in every way. <br/><br/>This Daisy Zane was truly something, able to make a man’s eyes full of her and only her. <br/><br/>If she had known Kevin Clark was conquerable, she wouldn’t have endured hardships at the military district. She should have stayed by his side, using some enchanting methods instead. <br/><br/>She tried so hard to be worthy of him, wanting him to look at her more. <br/><br/>She couldn’t just let someone else snatch him away. <br/><br/>If he could like a woman, then she must also find a way for him to fall for her. <br/><br/>“Sister, what are you doing?” <br/><br/>As she watched them, she talked to Charles Amos, telling him to honor these uncles and brothers in the future. <br/><br/>Charles Amos nodded, saying that he would set aside a pension for each of them. <br/><br/>Juan Wright laughed and said, “Why not just open a nursing home and put us all inside? That way, when we’re old, we can all stay together.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane laughed and said, “That’s not a bad idea.” <br/><br/>As they were chatting, a whistle sounded nearby. Daisy Zane and the others looked up. <br/><br/>They saw Bonnie Maxwell and a man walking over. <br/><br/>The two of them looked about fifty to sixty percent alike. Although Daisy Zane had never seen the man, she could guess that he and Bonnie Maxwell were related by blood. <br/><br/>Michael Jackson and Juan Wright’s expressions changed. <br/><br/>They both knew that back then, only a few people had heard that Bonnie Maxwell had been designated as the future wife of Third Master. <br/><br/>Even Thomas Firway still believed that Bonnie Maxwell should be Third Master’s wife. <br/><br/>The appearance of these two people here now clearly meant they were up to no good. <br/><br/>Michael Jackson and Juan Wright immediately walked up to them and smiled, “Miss Maxwell, Young Master Maxwell, the Third Master has just been called away by the Commander and is not here.” <br/><br/>George Maxwell smiled and said, “It’s alright, we’re not looking for Third <br/><br/>Master. We just saw a large crowd here and wanted to join in the excitement.” Juan Wright rubbed his hands together and laughed, “Young Master Maxwell, when Third Master left, he specifically ordered that no one else is allowed to come near. Please don’t make things difficult for us as his subordinates.” “How could we be considered ‘others!?” George Maxwell insisted. <br/><br/>Bonnie Maxwell, on the other hand, directly went to pick up a revolver. Juan <br/><br/>Wright wanted to stop her, but when he saw her pick up the gun, he and Michael Jackson immediately shielded Daisy Zane and Charles Amos behind them. <br/><br/>Bonnie Maxwell looked at their actions, chuckled softly, and then focused on loading six bullets into the revolving handgun. <br/><br/>After loading, she aimed at the target in the distance. <br/><br/>She fired six shots, each one in the 10-ring. <br/><br/>James Collins, standing next to her, watched her and said with a slight lift of his beautiful peach blossom eyes, “Not bad.” <br/><br/>“This is called ‘not bad,’ my friend, you don’t understand.” George Maxwell said. <br/><br/>“This level of skill, I don’t quite understand.” James Collins disassembled a handgun next to him and then began reassembling it, “After all, I started with this level of skill when I first handled guns.” <br/><br/>“Shameless boasting.” Bonnie Maxwell said. <br/><br/>James Collins knew that she had come to make trouble as soon as this woman walked over and glanced at his sister. So, he didn’t bother being polite. He shrugged his shoulders, “What I know is that mediocre people can’t understand us geniuses.” <br/><br/>Bonnie Maxwell glanced at him again, ignoring him, and looked directly at Daisy Zane, saying, “Do you dare to compete?”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
