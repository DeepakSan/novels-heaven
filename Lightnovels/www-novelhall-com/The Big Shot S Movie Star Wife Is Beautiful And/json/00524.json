At that time, our Chief Designer was still single. Back then, the young Miss Zane had not yet revealed her true identity. Third Master Clark approached me and discussed a series of endorsements. He told me that her fame would definitely be able to support Spotlight’s endorsement. Now, Young Miss Zane has lived up to everyone’s expectations and Third Master’s hopes with her fame. So, there are some people who have endorsed themselves.]<br/><br/>Felix made no attempt to hide the fact that he had to bow his head to capital interests.<br/><br/>After all, his own Chief Designer would be endorsing his own brand in the end.<br/><br/>Moreover, over the years, he has only ever bowed his head to Kevin Clark with so much capital involved.<br/><br/>One reason was that the amount he offered back then was simply too much. The other reason was that it was better to keep the benefits within the family, since the person in question was his own Chief Designer.<br/><br/>So, he didn’t avoid talking about these things.<br/><br/>As soon as this status was posted, the comments section was filled with laughter.<br/><br/>A few negative comments were drowned out in the sea of laughter.<br/><br/>After laughing at Felix Baker’s Facebook post, everyone rushed back to Kevin Clark’s Facebook page.<br/><br/>[Sisters, hurry up, hurry up! There’s a big, grievously wronged party here. A huge one!]<br/><br/>[It seems like there’s a big, grievously wronged party here. I’m not sure yet, let me take a closer look.]<br/><br/>[Hahahaha, thank you, Third Master, for giving me so much joy today.]<br/><br/>[Am I the only one who wants to know how Third Master felt when he found out the truth?]<br/><br/>[It turns out that the road Third Master took to chase after his wife was so bumpy. It’s really hard not to laugh.]<br/><br/>[So impressive, Third Master is truly impressive. He somehow makes his own wife earn the money for him.]<br/><br/>[It turns out that Third Master didn’t know at the beginning. Comparing this to now, I suddenly feel much better.]<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Kevin Clark didn’t know he was being laughed at by the entire internet.<br/><br/>Today they were taking a day off, and he had initially planned to visit the Easton Group in the morning. But after breakfast, Charlotte Lane arrived, so he worked in the study instead.<br/><br/>Charlotte was initially in the study with him, but she left with Charles Amos to have fun after less than an hour.<br/><br/>It wasn’t until almost 11 o’clock when his cell phone kept ringing that he finally checked it.<br/><br/>They were all links shared by Allonzo Hobson.<br/><br/>And messages of “Hahahahaha” sent by Allonzo Hobson.<br/><br/>However...an hour passed with no response.<br/><br/>Hill Dawson didn’t dare disclose her identity carelessly, so she sent Daisy a message.<br/><br/>But... Charlotte Lane was busy watching Charles Amos “training” at Clark Manor.<br/><br/>This year, Clark Manor had many swings. Charlotte sat on one of them, watching Charles Amos and Harton Clark stand at attention.<br/><br/>Then she watched Harton Clark and Charles Amos standing at ease, turning left and right, and running in place.<br/><br/>She hadn’t even noticed the message on her cellphone.<br/><br/>With no response for a long time, the doubters’ voices became even more intense.<br/><br/>They kept tagging Cloud Clothing and Rainbow Skirts, Joseph Allen, and Austin Allen,<br/><br/>asking Austin Allen to sue on behalf of his brother right away.<br/><br/>Since Austin never lost a lawsuit, the netizens believed that Daisy Zane was in even greater danger this time.<br/><br/>Finally, at around 10:40, Joseph Allen posted on Facebook,<br/><br/>[Since everyone has hyped up the situation, I think it’s not bad to give everyone another surprise. Officially introducing @Daisy Zane@ Flynn Ninevara as Cloud Clothing and Rainbow Skirts’ founder and chief designer – Shopie Easton. And, all the clothes Shopie has worn have been my own designs without plagiarism. Since she doesn’t like carrying bags, each skirt also has pockets added. Cloud Clothing and Rainbow Skirts’ products are naturally based on their theme colors. As their chief and founder, I don’t need to wear clothes from others. As their chief and founder, I have the funds to wear Cloud Clothing and Rainbow Skirts’ as my daily attire.]<br/><br/>Beneath Joseph Allen’s Facebook post, there was an array of question marks at first.<br/><br/>Then, the netizens went crazy.<br/><br/>[Help! Help! Can you not treat me like this? It makes me feel like a useless extra in this world.]<br/><br/>[Oh my God, can you stop letting Daisy Zane show off? I can’t take it.]<br/><br/>[I admit, I’m a hater. But I can’t hate her. I’m leaving the Internet, see you all in the next life online.]<br/><br/>[Ah — our fans were worriedly discussing whether or not to knock Austin and Joseph unconscious, preventing them from speaking. And then... you tell me, you’re one of the founders of Cloud Clothing and Rainbow Skirts.]<br/><br/>[I’m mad, unfollowing for a day.]<br/><br/>[Suddenly feel like I’m not worthy of being her fan.]<br/><br/>[You know what, I think Third Master Clark might have aimed too high.]<br/><br/>[Sister, that’s the Easton Group, one of the world’s wealthiest conglomerates. Third Master’s wealth is unimaginable, and his nobility is unattainable.]<br/><br/>[That’s it, I’m going to study. I’m not worthy of being a Daisy Zane fan. Everyone... let’s meet at the top in the future.]<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>The rivalry between Felix Baker and Joseph Allen for the position of Chief Designer then emerged.<br/><br/>At first, it was happening just beneath Joseph Allen’s Facebook post.<br/><br/>Likewise, they both posted on their own Facebook,<br/><br/>Felix Baker: [@DaisyZane@FlynnNinevara. Our Spotlight’s Chief!]<br/><br/>Joseph Allen: [@DaisyZane@FlynnNinevara. The founder and Chief Designer of Cloud Clothing and Rainbow Skirts.] – Then pinned the post.<br/><br/>Netizens went from shock to enjoying the show.<br/><br/>Arthur North, witnessing the situation, posted on Facebook: [@JosephAllen @FelixBaker. My wife, what are you two fighting for?]\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
