But instead of seeing her driver’s car in its original parking spot, she saw Kevin Clark, Michael Jackson, and Juan Wright. <br/><br/>Upon seeing her, Kevin Clark came over, embraced her, and touched her head, saying, “Don’t be angry, I’ll find a solution.” <br/><br/>Feeling his body warmth, Daisy Zane felt her body recovering its heat. She closed her eyes and said softly, “They shouldn’t have targeted me.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark understood her implicit meaning: “Leave everything to me.” <br/><br/>“It might be troublesome.” Daisy Zane said, “Bonnie Maxwell is involved.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane had no associations with the Imperial Capital, she could do whatever she wanted without consideration. But now it was different, she was the wife of Kevin Clark, some things could cause trouble for Kevin Clark and the Clark Family. <br/><br/>It could even have some effect. <br/><br/>“Bonnie Maxwell?” Asked Kevin Clark, promptly realising, “A hacker?” <br/><br/>As soon as the problem arose, Juan Wright took action. He found out that the video was sent out by Amelia Miles and that a hacker had helped her hide it. <br/><br/>But he didn’t find out who the hacker was. <br/><br/>In terms of skill, Bonnie Maxwell was not as good as Juan Wright.

A lot of Mimi’s clothes were designed by her. <br/><br/>This is the same Miss that Theo Clark has lost to. <br/><br/>Charles Amos, holding Elina Clark’s hand, was dazzled the moment he saw Daisy Zane. His eyes sparkled. <br/><br/>“Dad.” Kevin Clark called out to him. <br/><br/>Charles immediately let go of Elina Clark’s hand, ran to Daisy Zane, looked up at her, his eyes shining bright. <br/><br/>“Daisy came.” Elina Clark reacted, straightened his back, trying to look younger. His voice also had a more kindly tone than usual, “Come on in.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane pursed her lips and called out, “Uncle.” <br/><br/>“Eh.” Elina Clark smiled and replied, “Come in, come in.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane lightly patted Charles’s head and led him inside by pulling his clothing by the shoulder. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark held her hand, giving her a reassuring squeeze. <br/><br/>The tea room was spacious. Upon entering, it was discovered that it was not just Mr. &amp; Mrs. Clark. The entire family of Theo Clark was also present. Bonnie Maxwell was there too, along with two tea masters. <br/><br/>Tom Wayne looked surprised when he saw her. He immediately walked towards her. “Daisy.” <br/><br/>Hardy Clark was eactly the same, equally surprised and followed Tom Wayne. “Auntie!”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
