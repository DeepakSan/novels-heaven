She wasn’t feverish.<br/><br/>“What are you doing?”<br/><br/>“Why are you so down?” Daisy Zane asked, “Why is our nation’s flower wilting?”<br/><br/>Amelie Quentin glanced at her and then huffily looked away again.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane was about to tease her a little more when Marsh Turner suddenly came over, a crowd in tow.<br/><br/>“Daisy, long time no see.”<br/><br/>“We just saw each other last Friday.”<br/><br/>“But it’s been two days already.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane lifted the corner of her mouth and asked, “What are you discussing?”<br/><br/>“Celestial Pivot,” Marsh Turner answered, “Daisy, have you ever heard of Celestial Pivot? The Celestial Pivot Detective Agency.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised an eyebrow: “I’ve heard a bit about it.”<br/><br/>At the same time, William Butch, who had heard these two words, gently stroked the tips of his fingers resting on his legs, and his eyelashes trembled slightly.<br/><br/>“Daisy, you know about Celestial Pivot too.” Turner Daniel also turned around and asked.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane nodded.<br/><br/>“On Wednesday, Celestial Pivot is holding a member selection.” Marsh Turner said.<br/><br/>Naturally, Daisy Zane knew about it. She just didn’t expect this matter to be discussed at school.<br/><br/>Nobody spoke.<br/><br/>After all, in their minds, Bonnie Maxwell was not only beautiful, but also talented in both literary and martial arts, almost omnipotent, and capable of anything.<br/><br/>The Celestial Pivot’s assessment might indeed not be a challenge for her.<br/><br/>Most importantly, she held the title of future wife of Harton Clark.<br/><br/>Who at this table would dare to provoke the Clark Family? That was simply suicidal.<br/><br/>Only Olivia Lane spoke up: “Oh, you mean Bonnie Maxwell. You sounded so confident I thought you were talking about yourself. Whether others can make it or not, what’s there for you to be so proud of?”<br/><br/>Everyone’s gazes immediately fell on Olivia Lane.<br/><br/>The two boys who shared a table behind Olivia Lane were standing by Marsh Turner, discussing their previous topic. Seeing this, they signaled her repeatedly to stop talking.<br/><br/>But Olivia Lane, in a bad mood, did not shut up: “If your sister is so capable, why doesn’t she break the Celestial Pivot’s defense system?”<br/><br/>“Olivia Lane, you ” As Jessica Maxwell spoke, she got up and walked towards her.<br/><br/>However, Marsh Turner blocked her after only one step, looking at her with downcast eyes.<br/><br/>Jessica Maxwell’s chest rose and fell dramatically as her face contorted in anger: “Marsh Turner, step aside.”<br/><br/>“What for if I do? To start a fight?” Marsh Turner said calmly.<br/><br/>“None of your business.”<br/><br/>“What if I insist on interfering?”<br/><br/>“So you’re taking Olivia Lane’s side against me?” Jessica Maxwell glared at him, “Do you know who I am? Do you want to offend the Maxwell Family? Or the Clark Family?!”<br/><br/>Upon hearing ‘Clark family’, Daisy Zane raised an eyebrow.<br/><br/>Olivia Lane looked at her and then leaned close, whispering in her ear, “Everyone in Imperial Capital secretly says that Bonnie Maxwell is Harton Clark’s future wife. When you get home, you should teach Harton Clark a lesson.”<br/><br/>“Your suggestion is not bad,” the glint of amusement in Daisy Zane’s eyes deepened.<br/><br/>Upon hearing her reply, Olivia Lane suddenly felt a little happier. She completely forgot that her voice was being picked up by the microphone.<br/><br/>She was burying a super huge pit for herself down the line.<br/><br/>Marsh Turner said: “Don’t try to scare me with that, I’m not falling for your tricks.”<br/><br/>Jessica Maxwell was quivering with rage, but if she backed down now, she would lose face. She had to settle things with Olivia Lane.<br/><br/>Looking at her still not backing down, Marsh Turner thought to himself, lady, I’m trying to save you.<br/><br/>If you so much as touch Olivia Lane’s clothes today,<br/><br/>Tomorrow, the Lane Family’s helicopter could be hovering above your house.<br/><br/>The stalemate between them wasn’t resolved until a few girls, under the guise of comforting her, led Jessica Maxwell away.<br/><br/>Only then did the farce end.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
