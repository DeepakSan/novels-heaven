If one day Daisy had a wedding, the suitors could fill several tables. <br/><br/>But he was very sure that Daisy’s feelings were blank, whiter than white paper. <br/><br/>Although Daisy Zane was very impressive, beyond normal in his eyes, no matter how impressive she was, she was still a woman. And women’s intelligence would drop by more than half once they fell in love. <br/><br/>This Kevin Clark was wicked in everything, obviously not a good thing in appearance. His reputation was also extremely poor. What if he played with Daisy? <br/><br/>Thinking of this, Robinson cursed and changed legs to shake. <br/><br/>After a while, the sound of cleaning dishes and chopsticks came from the restaurant. Robinson crossed his legs, straightened his body. Examine the origin of this data, deeply intertwined with n0v[lbin★<br/><br/>Only then did he see a wooden box on the tea table. It was sandalwood, with exquisite patterns carved around it, and the craftsmanship was very fine. <br/><br/>It was valuable. <br/><br/>Robinson thought it belonged to Daisy Zane, so he just opened it. <br/><br/>Inside was a red jade hairpin. It was red all over, without any impurities. The hexagonal head was also carved with a phoenix, and the craftsmanship was very meticulous. <br/><br/>It could be seen that it had been around for a long time, but it had been well preserved. <br/><br/>Robinson could not take his eyes off these historical, meticulously crafted, and pure materials. <br/><br/>He watched the box for a while, until Kevin Clark and Daisy Zane came out of the restaurant together, only then did he move his eyes away from the hairpin and look at Daisy Zane. <br/><br/>His expression was full of incomprehension. <br/><br/>“Lucia, at the auction, didn’t you say that this thing wasn’t worth 100 million, and you didn’t want it?” Robinson held the wooden box and said, “How come you bought it back in the blink of an eye? You, you... It’s much more enjoyable to pressure that bastard at the auction, why buy it privately?” <br/><br/>“What thing?” Daisy Zane asked as she sat down on the sofa and glanced at the box in his hand. <br/><br/>“This hairpin.” Robinson said, “At the Imperial Capital Apocalypse Hotel auction, there was a son-of-a-gun who was bidding with us all the time, and later you said you didn’t want it. How much did you spend to buy it? How do you know the buyer? I tried to find him for a long time.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane glanced at the box again, and then looked at Kevin Clark. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark was also looking at her, his eyes filled with pampering, soaked with laughter, and a touch of investigative color. <br/><br/>After a brief exchange of glances, Daisy Zane moved her gaze away and said, <br/><br/>“It’s not mine, he brought it.” <br/><br/>“Who?” Robinson looked at Daisy Zane, and saw Daisy Zane lift her chin towards Kevin Clark. He turned his head to look at him, and the corners of his mouth twitched fiercely twice. <br/><br/>“Fairy Clan, bastard.” Kevin Clark’s gaze passed over Robinson’s gauze-wrapped arm and said softly, “Miss Su’s impression of me is really unique.” <br/><br/>The light and fluttery tone was indeed oppressive. <br/><br/>But, in all these years, Robinson had been known as “Roy Ryder” and “Emma Clark”, and he always walked sideways. He used to scare others, but being scared... was out of the question! <br/><br/>He looked up to face his gaze, full of rivalry and even more hostility. <br/><br/>Obviously, the intention was to let him bleed even if she couldn’t get it. <br/><br/>“Well, no fight, no friendship, I guess.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised her eyebrows. <br/><br/>Not only the hairpin, but also a Peking opera headdress. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane failed to get the hairpin, so when Kevin Clark tried to bid for a Peking opera headdress afterward, she also bid against him and raised the price of the headdress as well. <br/><br/>“Give me the cup; I’ll boil some water.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane handed him the cup and watched him go to the kitchen, then looked at the hairpin on the tea table. <br/><br/>After contemplating for a while. <br/><br/>Next time they went to Celestial Pivot for information, they should let Holt Lawrence have a look at the stars and do it for free. <br/><br/>Maple Elite Entertainment <br/><br/>John Anderson and Olivia Chester had been busy all morning trying to remove the hot searches but couldn’t. The company’s uniform clarification statements were not believed by anyone. <br/><br/>Not just the company and Olivia Chester; all of Olivia Chester’s artists were also attacked. <br/><br/>Plus those who were kicking them when they were down. <br/><br/>Maple Elite Entertainment had suffered the worst blow since its establishment. John Anderson had tried to find everyone he could, but they couldn’t even find out who they had offended. <br/><br/>“John, how’s it going?” Amelia Miles hurried over as soon as she heard the news in the morning. <br/><br/>John Anderson sighed and patted her head: “I’ve done my best. All we can do now is minimize the company’s losses and wait for the storm to pass.” <br/><br/>This matter was true, and they had done what they could in terms of public relations and preparations. They could only wait for the storm to pass. <br/><br/>“Don’t worry, I’ll be with you. Let’s take a break.” Amelia Miles’ eyes curved into a smile as she held onto his arm and leaned on his shoulder. After a while, she sighed, “I don’t know what’s going on recently. First, the Miles Group had a problem, and now it’s Maple Elite. It’s like something has affected our family’s fortune. <br/><br/>“It’s inevitable in doing business,” John said, pretending not to hear the hint in her words. “How’s the Miles Group doing now?” <br/><br/>“It has stabilized, but the losses are a bit heavy. The company has developed well in recent years, with a solid foundation, so there’s no big problem. If it were a few years ago, it might have gone bankrupt.” Amelia Miles explained, “Thanks to your help, John. My dad said to invite you for dinner when you have time.” <br/><br/>“No need to thank me, it’s what I should do.” <br/><br/>“I wonder how my sister is doing lately? I’ve been too busy with the family affairs,” Amelia mentioned. <br/><br/>John Anderson’s expression froze for a moment. <br/><br/>He knew about Olivia Chester’s changing roles, but since Olivia Chester held shares in the company and had status in the industry, he didn’t want to make things too ugly with her, so he didn’t stop her. <br/><br/>However, not even a day had passed before the Imperial City Bennett Family had been investigated. <br/><br/>Was it a coincidence, or was it related to Daisy Zane? Did Daisy Zane really have such power? <br/><br/>His father had insisted on signing Daisy Zane, but his father didn’t want to talk about it afterward. <br/><br/>His father only told him to not let her be bullied and not to treat her differently. He wanted her to walk a clean path in this industry. <br/><br/>It must be a coincidence. Otherwise, why would his father give him such a warning? <br/><br/>If she were really that powerful, why would she join the entertainment industry? And why would she choose Maple Elite Entertainment instead of going to Imperial Capital?\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
