She even thought that this development was more normal. <br/><br/>The two of them had been together for a long time, and their relationship had always been stable. Something should have happened by now. <br/><br/>Otherwise, she would have doubted whether there was something wrong with them. <br/><br/>“What’s wrong?” Charles asked in a low voice, looking at their reactions. <br/><br/>Wilton regained his senses and quickly accepted the situation: “Nothing, nothing. Go play, Little Young Master.” <br/><br/>He then turned and ordered the kitchen to prepare several nutritious dishes. <br/><br/>At 11:30, Daisy finally woke up. <br/><br/>As soon as she opened her eyes, she saw Harton Clark’s handsome face up close. <br/><br/>The annoyance of having to get up was greatly diluted. <br/><br/>She had rarely seen a man with such good skin. Looking at him so closely, there wasn’t a single flaw, and he was even more stunning. <br/><br/>“Awake?” Harton Clark had been awake for a while, but he took the rare opportunity to stay in bed. <br/><br/>Daisy blinked her eyelashes gently and looked at the sunlight outside. “Is it this late?” <br/><br/>“It’s fine. Get cleaned up, and we’ll have lunch just in time.” <br/><br/>Daisy rolled over to lie flat on the bed without hurrying to get up. She felt Harton Clark’s arm and asked, “Is it numb?” <br/><br/>Daisy closed her eyes again and asked, “Does your head still hurt?” “Thanks to the little girl’s shelter last night, it doesn’t hurt anymore.” “I should have kicked you out last night and let you sleep on the streets.” <br/><br/>“You definitely wouldn’t have the heart to.” <br/><br/>Daisy chuckled and sat up, then straddled Harton Clark, grabbed her cell phone from the bedside table, and sat down to check her messages. <br/><br/>Harton Clark thought this little girl was not only treating him as if he wasn’t a man but even as if he wasn’t a person. <br/><br/>She seemed to treat him like air, as though she couldn’t see him at all. <br/><br/>He sat up and hugged her from behind, kissing her cheek. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane reached for a piece of sweet and sour pork ribs with her chopsticks, pretending not to notice Kevin Clark’s gaze. <br/><br/>Wilton Edwards immediately understood and fetched a bigger bowl, and scooped one for him: “Third Master, please.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark: <br/><br/>Hill Dawson pretended not to see any of this and ate his meal indifferently. Occasionally, he would pick some dishes for Charles Amos. However, Anisa Cooper hadn’t reached his level of detachment yet. <br/><br/>She bowed her head and bit her lip hard to prevent herself from laughing out loud because of Third Master Clark’s aggrieved expression. <br/><br/>However, Wilton Edwards paused and added another sentence: “Please don’t be polite, we have plenty more.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane laughed, her head down. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark glanced at her laughter, grinding his teeth. He pushed the bowl back to her: “Drinking it in advance will make it more effective. Be good, drink up.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s smile at the corner of her mouth stiffened as she looked up at him. <br/><br/>His words suggested that something might happen to her later where she would be weak. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark stared back at her, his enchanting eyes exuding a dangerous vibe. <br/><br/>Charles Amos, sipping soup with a spoon, watched the two of them. He accidentally knocked the spoon against the bowl, making a crisp sound. <br/><br/>Breaking the silence that had arisen. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked away first, then placed the bowl next to Charles Amos and said, “Uncle Clark said that taking it in advance works better.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark: ‘ There was really no need to take it that much in advance. <br/><br/>Young Charles, looking at the untouched bowl of soup in front of him, wondered if it had been poisoned. His little face twitched, thinking to himself: <br/><br/>This must be what they call getting burned when the city gates catch fire. <br/><br/>Charles Amos, who had inexplicably drunk the soup, followed Kevin Clark around after lunch. <br/><br/>Since Kevin Clark also drank the soup, Charles felt that they were both in the same boat. He kept following him, looking for a sense of comfort from having someone to share his misery with. <br/><br/>After lunch, Daisy Zane went to the side hall to tell Hill Dawson and Anisa Cooper about her upcoming variety show appearance. <br/><br/>Hill Dawson was stunned for a few seconds after hearing this and then almost went outside to set off fireworks in celebration. <br/><br/>She felt as if her wealth god had finally awakened. <br/><br/>The trio then called Director Nash to discuss some details about the show. Charles Amos followed Kevin Clark to the main hall, where they played chess together. <br/><br/>Within an hour, many messages and phone calls had come into Kevin Clark’s silenced cell phone placed aside. <br/><br/>Looking at the phone that flashed occasionally, Kevin Clark thought it was about time to go back. <br/><br/>He glanced at Charles Amos. In a moment, he raised an eyebrow and said, “Charles, you’ve used that piano for several years, right?” <br/><br/>“Yeah.” <br/><br/>“Let’s go. I’ll buy you a new one..”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
