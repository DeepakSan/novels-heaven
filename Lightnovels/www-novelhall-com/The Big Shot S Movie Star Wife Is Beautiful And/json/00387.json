Otherwise, she wouldn’t have found it pointless: “We’re definitely not letting you stay here. But we’ll allow you to submit your resignation letter voluntarily. As for why you’re resigning from here as long as it doesn’t damage the reputation of Cloud Clothing and Rainbow Skirts, any reason is fine.”<br/><br/>Leaving with dignity, she could also try her luck elsewhere.<br/><br/>“Thank you, Mr. Easton, thank you, Mr. Easton.”<br/><br/>“No need to thank me,” Daisy said.<br/><br/>“Thank you, Boss Wayne, thank you, Boss Wayne.”<br/><br/>Joseph’s assistant took the salesperson away, leaving just the manager, who apologized to Natalie Wayne and Jane Chester before going to help sort things out.<br/><br/>Once they were all gone, Joseph apologized to Natalie Wayne and Jane Chester again.<br/><br/>“Boss Wayne, you haven’t eaten yet, have you? Would you like to have dinner together?”<br/><br/>Natalie Wayne hesitated slightly. Kevin Clark wasn’t present. She didn’t know if going out to dinner with her daughter-in-law and another man would cause her son to make sarcastic remarks about her.<br/><br/>And she—she wanted to go back and have a chat with her husband Kevin about how they have such a powerful daughter-in-law.<br/><br/>But just as she hesitated for those two seconds, Kevin Clark appeared at the entrance.<br/><br/>It was clear that he had rushed over, as he was still breathing unsteadily after standing still.<br/><br/>His eyes first fell on Daisy Zane, observing her emotions for a moment before looking at Natalie Wayne and Jane Chester, saying: “Mom, senior.”<br/><br/>Jane Chester smiled and responded.Rêạd new chapters at novelhall.com<br/><br/>Natalie Wayne:<br/><br/>Seeing Kevin in such a hurry, Joseph paused for a moment before saying: “Third Master.”<br/><br/>Kevin didn’t even acknowledge him, he just walked up to Daisy Zane, swallowed, and said: “Little girl.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane smiled but didn’t say anything.<br/><br/>However, due to her ambiguous smile, Kevin felt a chill in his heart and immediately put a stop to the shopping trip: “Mom, senior. Let’s go to dinner.”<br/><br/>Joseph said: “Third Master, just now, there was some unpleasantness here. I’d like to take Boss Wayne to dinner as an apology.”<br/><br/>Kevin looked towards Natalie Wayne.<br/><br/>Natalie Wayne smiled: “Mr. Allen, you’re too kind. Now that Lucia is part of Cloud Clothing and Rainbow Skirts, there is no need for such formalities.”<br/><br/>Kevin then turned to Daisy Zane. How could it be? How could she have another identity?<br/><br/>But Daisy Zane didn’t look at him, just politely listened to Natalie Wayne talking.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane, catching her breath, cast her eyes down at his flushed, thin lips.<br/><br/>“I also didn’t know she would take you shopping. So I couldn’t stop it at the first moment. And I even caused someone to upset you. I’m sorry.” Kevin’s voice was tender and intoxicating.<br/><br/>Daisy pursed her lips.<br/><br/>“My little girl has been wronged. It won’t happen again next time ”<br/><br/>Just as Kevin finished speaking, Daisy kissed him on the lips again.<br/><br/>Nothing else—she just found it eye-catching.<br/><br/>Kevin stuck to her lips and smiled before taking the initiative and kissing her deeply.<br/><br/>There was no tenderness or restraint from the pre-marital Third Master.<br/><br/>After getting married... the Third Master was tender but unrestrained, not knowing any limits.<br/><br/>“Madam, should we try...”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane covered his mouth just in time and let him swallow his words.<br/><br/>“Third Master, be patient.”<br/><br/>Kevin chuckled softly, and for a moment, he kissed her palm.<br/><br/>“Don’t be mad anymore.” He backed away, stroked her head, and coaxed her gently, “I promise it won’t happen again in the future.”<br/><br/>“I’m not mad,” Daisy said softly.<br/><br/>Kevin didn’t dare to speak. She wasn’t angry but just ignoring him.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane returned to the copilot’s seat, and Kevin didn’t start the car right away.<br/><br/>A little while later, Kevin took Daisy’s hand and placed his fingertip on her pulse.<br/><br/>“What’s wrong?” Daisy asked.<br/><br/>Kevin’s fingers pressed her pulse for a while before saying: “Your period has been delayed by several days.”<br/><br/>Daisy raised her eyebrows: “Didn’t I take precautions?”<br/><br/>Kevin looked up at her, inhaled gently, and said: “Don’t provoke me, my self-control is very weak right now.”<br/><br/>Daisy chuckled.<br/><br/>Kevin let go of her hand.<br/><br/>Daisy asked: “Is there a problem?”<br/><br/>“No.” Kevin started the car, his mind adjusting the recipe for the medicine packet as he laughed: “It’s getting colder now, so you won’t have a chance to eat ice cream.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane:\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
