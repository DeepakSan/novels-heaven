His other hand held hers all this time. <br/><br/>Daisy watched him for a while. <br/><br/>His skin was very good, smooth and radiant. He had long eyebrows and thick eyelashes, a tall, straight nose, and lips as red as cinnabar, seductive and bewitching. <br/><br/>If Mrs. Clark had given birth to a daughter at that time, she would undoubtedly be a stunning and sexy beauty. <br/><br/>A beauty that people would spend thousands to buy a smile from. <br/><br/>But being a man made it even better. The ancient and elegant gentleman had a fascinating and licentious face, and there was also a mysterious oppression about him. <br/><br/>Contradictions collide, yet they were extremely harmonious and attractive. <br/><br/>If there really was a creator, when he created Kevin Clark, he must have carefully pondered, cautiously and carefully, over and over again, slowly chiseling him out. Updated from novelbIn.(c)om<br/><br/>He must have been his most satisfying work. <br/><br/>Daisy looked at him for a while longer and gently pulled her hand out, trying to get up. <br/><br/>But as soon as she moved a little, Kevin Clark suddenly opened his eyes. <br/><br/>Groggy, with a hint of redness at the bottom of his eyes. Even more, like a fairy from the Fairy Clan. <br/><br/>“Xavier Dominic sent the evidence of her buying the paid trolls to John Anderson.” <br/><br/>Daisy looked at Kevin Clark, paused for two seconds, and then laughed: “He really did quite a number.” <br/><br/>Seeing that she didn’t take the matter to heart, Kevin Clark felt slightly relieved. He also smiled and said: “He said he’s not good at solving problems but great at creating them for others.” <br/><br/>“Pretty self-aware.” Daisy replied, while sending a text message to Morris and Hill Dawson, telling them not to worry about it. <br/><br/>Then she said, “Let’s find a hotel in the city tonight. We’ll head back to the Imperial Capital tomorrow.” <br/><br/>“Okay.” <br/><br/>Amelia Miles and John Anderson stayed in the Imperial Capital for one night before returning to Truro City. <br/><br/>It wasn’t until the evening when John Anderson came home and opened his computer to deal with some work issues that he discovered the evidence of Amelia buying paid trolls in his inbox. <br/><br/>A screenshot of a chat and the transaction information and real-name registration information of Amelia Miles’ bank card. <br/><br/>Amelia hadn’t come home that night either. She had just taken a bath and came to the study room to find him: “John, do you have any work to deal with?” John looked away from the computer and at her. <br/><br/>For the first time, Amelia saw John looking at her expressionlessly, and her heart skipped a beat: “What’s the matter? Did something happen?” <br/><br/>John looked back at the computer: “Come here and take a look.” <br/><br/>“What’s the matter, it’s so serious.” Amelia said as she walked over to him. <br/><br/>She had a sweet smile on her face, but as soon as she saw what was on the computer screen, her pupils suddenly constricted. <br/><br/>It was as if something heavy had collided near her ears, making a buzzing sound. <br/><br/>All the hair on her body stood on end. <br/><br/>She had deleted the chat log, so why did this material show up on John’s computer?\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
