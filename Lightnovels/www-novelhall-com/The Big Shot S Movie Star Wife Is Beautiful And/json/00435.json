He understood it would take time.<br/><br/>He placed his hand on the back of her neck, walking her to his side, then kissed her forehead: “You go to sleep. I have some matters to attend to.”<br/><br/>“Hmm.”<br/><br/>After Kevin left, Daisy Zane couldn’t sleep either.<br/><br/>She couldn’t fall asleep, and it was also daybreak. So she revised her script a bit more.<br/><br/>An unknown force entered Mountain Sea Continent, and the security of the place needed to be strengthened to prevent a potential disaster.<br/><br/>The remnants of the Thousand Mountains Alliance must be dealt with.<br/><br/>The Thousand Mountains Alliance’s influence in Mountain Sea Continent was not as great as Dark Radiance and Hundred Demons Pavilion, but it was not insignificant. Thus, there was a significant impact on the balance of power in the continent when it fell.<br/><br/>Everything needed to be balanced.<br/><br/>Dark Radiance’s training selection couldn’t be delayed for too long either.<br/><br/>It wasn’t just Dark Radiance that was busy; even the Hundred Demons Pavilion was swamped. Power shifts were no small matter, requiring utmost attention lest they lead to a whirlwind of bloodshed.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane only spent a day and a night at Dark Radiance.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane held back from giving him a glance, turning and walking away.<br/><br/>Kevin laughed as he caught up with her, hugging her from behind: “Actually, I don’t need that privilege. Mrs. Clark already has it.”<br/><br/>As they packed their things and carried their luggage downstairs, the likes of Adrian Roberts and James Cooper were there, too.<br/><br/>As soon as Daisy Zane took the last step, several people suddenly came to surround her.<br/><br/>“Lady Zane, we didn’t expect you to return to your country so soon. We didn’t have time to prepare anything. Please accept our small token of appreciation.”<br/><br/>Adrian Roberts opened the box in his hand and presented it to Daisy Zane.<br/><br/>Inside was a handgun.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane:<br/><br/>Adrian Roberts said: “This gun is custom-made, with improved range and accuracy. It also has minimal recoil. It’s the only one in the world.”<br/><br/>Just as Daisy Zane was about to speak, James Cooper abruptly said: “Lady Zane, this dagger is my piece of war loot, incredibly sharp. The handle contains a red gemstone, which complements your temperament nicely. I’m not good with daggers, so it’s always laid in my drawer. I took it out for you, Lady Zane, please don’t mind.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane:<br/><br/>“Mine isn’t as deadly; it’s a small hidden weapon,” Yoshua Archer said. “The main thing is that it’s fun to play with. I got it for you to have fun.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at the thing in his hand and thought that if she played with the weapon in her country, she’d probably get caught.<br/><br/>“They’re all about fighting and killing. Mine is more practical,” said Edward Darkmoon, holding a stone. “This is a piece of jadeite rough stone. There’s definitely something good inside. Take it back to your country and have a set of jewelry made. If you don’t want to do that, you can use it to hit someone.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane really couldn’t see how this thing was practical.

They even started boasting about their items while still gifting them.<br/><br/>As Kevin stood behind Daisy Zane, he turned into a background prop that no one cared about.<br/><br/>No one paid any attention to Third Master, but they were all revolving around his wife, showering her with gifts.<br/><br/>Did his beloved wife need gifts from these people?<br/><br/>Kevin’s expression grew colder inch by inch. Finally, unable to tolerate it anymore, he whispered: “Are you guys really that idle? Do you need me to find you something to do?”<br/><br/>The group instantly quieted down.<br/><br/>Then... like chased ducks, they all ran away.<br/><br/>Kevin and Daisy Zane got into the car. Those who had just run off came back to surround them.<br/><br/>They watched them leave.<br/><br/>Even after the car started, Adrian Roberts shouted: “Lady Zane, come visit us whenever you have time.”<br/><br/>“Seems like my wife is quite popular.” Kevin said.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane had only offered suggestions to a few people during her downtime. Besides that, if anyone had questions, she simply answered them.<br/><br/>“It’s because of Third Master’s fame.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
