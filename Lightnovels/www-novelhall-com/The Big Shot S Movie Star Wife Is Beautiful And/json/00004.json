Your conditions are good, with just a slightly better script and production team, you can definitely become popular...\" <br/><br/>As Allonzo said all this, Arthur could only sit in the copilot seat and look at the girl in the back seat through the rearview mirror. <br/><br/>The girl sat casually, with her back slightly leaning against the seat, legs together and hands resting in her pockets. Her posture was very well-behaved, yet full of confidence. <br/><br/>Her appearance was exquisitely cold, especially those phoenix eyes, the corners of which slightly turned up, giving her an impressive air. <br/><br/>But she was also very patient. <br/><br/>Allonzo had so much to say, speaking fast and carelessly. <br/><br/>Yet she responded to each and every one of them. This material is rooted in n0velbin★<br/><br/>Although mostly with only a few words. <br/><br/>In addition to the nicely furnished building, the top floor offered a panoramic view of the entire Truro City, which was very beautiful. <br/><br/>Returning home, Daisy opened the door and saw a high heel lying paralyzed near the entrance. The other one was... temporarily lost. <br/><br/>She changed her shoes and went in, spotting the other one at the guest room entrance. <br/><br/>The only person she had given the password to was Robinson Scott. No one else would dare take off their shoes in her room like this. <br/><br/>Daisy opened the guest room door. <br/><br/>Robinson was very alert, opened her eyes at the sound, and looked towards the entrance with bloodshot eyes. <br/><br/>Seeing that it was Daisy, she lay back down on the bed and buried her head in the pillow, \"Brother Nine, you're back?\" <br/><br/>\"When did you get here?\" Daisy asked, not bothering to correct her name-calling due to her current state. <br/><br/>\"More than an hour, I guess.\" Robinson's weak voice, after finishing this sentence, seemed to fall asleep, \"I haven't slept for two nights in a row. The commotion at the Sky Rights Hotel last night was quite big.\" <br/><br/>\"Hmm.\" Daisy leaned against the door frame and responded, \"I was at home all day.\" <br/><br/>\"Good.\" Robinson answered, then immediately fell into a deeper sleep. <br/><br/>With Daisy around, she just needed to sleep – anything else would be taken care of. <br/><br/>Gently closing the guest room door, Daisy ignored the shoes at the entrance, went back to her room, took her computer, and sat on the balcony, adjusting the format of the report. <br/><br/>She finished adjusting the format in a few seconds, changing the line spacing from 18 points to 1.5 times. <br/><br/>Daisy was used to writing with an 18-point line spacing and seeing that spacing. She intended to unify the spacing with the professor's preferences. <br/><br/>But... it hadn't been successful this time.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
