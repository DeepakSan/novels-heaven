He hurriedly stood up, jumped twice, forcefully coughed twice, and finally breathed smoothly.<br/><br/>He kept coughing for a while until his face turned red.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane watched him quietly. Seeing that he was fine, she said, “Even a cooked crab isn’t as red as you.”<br/><br/>Black Fox immediately took a couple of deep breaths and looked at Daisy Zane, “Brother Nine, you actually got married!”<br/><br/>“Can’t I get married?”<br/><br/>“For real?” Black Fox couldn’t accept it. It had to be an exceptional man to catch her eye.<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>Black Fox touched his shaved head and forced himself to accept the fact. Then, he suddenly looked at Adrian Roberts.<br/><br/>Adrian Roberts sensed his gaze and immediately looked at him.<br/><br/>He thought Black Fox was going to cause trouble, but saw him walk over with a smile, “Big Brother, I apologize for any offense. I apologize.”<br/><br/>Adrian Roberts:<br/><br/>“I didn’t recognize a true hero. The man who could marry Brother Nine must be someone I can’t beat.” Black Fox said sincerely, “Black Fox also can’t beat Dark Radiance. Please forgive any offense.”<br/><br/>Adrian Roberts didn’t say anything.<br/><br/>Black Fox waited for a while, but Adrian didn’t speak, so he suddenly reached out to shake his hand.<br/><br/>Adrian Roberts dodged immediately.<br/><br/>Black Fox hesitated for a moment and tried again. He forcefully grabbed his hand, shook it, and let go, “Let’s shake hands and make peace. We’re friends from now on. Rest assured, if we meet in the future and need help, Black Fox will definitely help. My Brother Nine’s in-law family is also Black Fox’s in-law family.”<br/><br/>Adrian Roberts:<br/><br/>Daisy Zane:<br/><br/>Michael Jackson chuckled.<br/><br/>Moreover, they were quite merciful, going easy on the other party. They focused solely on stealing the goods without causing serious injury.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane participated in the heist as well.<br/><br/>She took on the leader of the cargo team single-handedly.<br/><br/>She subdued him in just a few moves, then, while holding him down, she smirked and said, “Tell Gael Easton that this shipment will cover his rent and living expenses in the Imperial Capital.”<br/><br/>Adrian stood by her side, still trying to figure out how she had subdued the man with her slender, fair fingers, and wondering why they were so strong and so fast. Then he heard her say that sentence.<br/><br/>He knew what kind of figure Gael Easton was in M Continent.<br/><br/>Gael Easton had his own power, scattered throughout M Continent, and even had the identity of the M Continent Monarch Dynasty.<br/><br/>Everyone would rather avoid getting involved with someone like him, as he was big trouble.<br/><br/>But she had gotten involved, and even knew him personally.<br/><br/>The person she was holding down was taken aback. Daisy Zane didn’t let go of him, but instead told Michael Jackson, “Take the goods and go.”<br/><br/>Dark Radiance’s men immediately drove off with the loaded trucks.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane stayed behind with Adrian Roberts and Black Fox.<br/><br/>Afterward, Black Fox followed Daisy Zane all the way to Shallow Creek.<br/><br/>Once there, Adrian Roberts met up with James Cooper before parting ways with Black Fox.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane even allowed Black Fox to take two more truckloads of goods.<br/><br/>“Brother Nine, I’ll be going now. If you ever need my help, just call me.”<br/><br/>“Alright.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane watched them leave.<br/><br/>As soon as they left, James Cooper’s face was filled with the word “gossip” as he eagerly looked at Adrian Roberts.<br/><br/>Adrian Roberts looked at him with curiosity and suddenly understood how Michael Jackson felt as someone who knew everything while watching everyone else know nothing.<br/><br/>This inscrutable feeling was quite exhilarating.<br/><br/>Adrian Roberts coughed lightly, feigning profundity as he said, “It’s exactly as you’ve seen. Let’s hurry back.”<br/><br/>James Cooper was puzzled: “What I’ve seen... what is it?”<br/><br/>Having said that, he looked at Kent Jericho: “Kent, what’s going on? That was Black Fox, right? Why did Black Fox call Lady Zane ‘Brother Nine’? How come you guys have so many more goods? What’s in these trucks?”<br/><br/>Kent Jericho cleared his throat and mysteriously replied, “The secrets of the heavens cannot be revealed.”<br/><br/>James Cooper:<br/><br/>Michael Jackson looked at James Cooper’s unsatisfied curiosity and smiled before going to find Daisy Zane.<br/><br/>James Cooper stood in place, watching each of them.<br/><br/>What happened after they separated and why were they being so secretive?<br/><br/>“Hey, you, stop! What happened to Captain Mason?” James Cooper grabbed another person, “What did you all encounter? Tell me about it, let’s share. We’re brothers, right? Share. Just tell me secretly, I won’t tell anyone else... “\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
