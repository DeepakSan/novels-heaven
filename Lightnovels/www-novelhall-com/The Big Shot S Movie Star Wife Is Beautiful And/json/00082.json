She rubbed it with her hand, <br/><br/>“It’s not the time yet.” <br/><br/>Arthur North immediately understood that for such matters, it is best to make as much noise as possible, so that they have no chance to suppress the news. <br/><br/>Moreover, Daisy Zane’s popularity is indeed a great opportunity. <br/><br/>Furthermore, they shouldn’t be the ones to take action regarding the illegitimate daughter’s incident. The Miles Family would surely react first. <br/><br/>“Alright, I got it.” He turned off the cell phone screen, pulled her sleeve, and hid her exposed hand inside her sleeve. <br/><br/>She knew about Claudia Zane and Johanes Miles’ marriage, and she also knew about her own investigation. <br/><br/>The incident with the private child seemed to be used by others to attack her, but in fact, everything was under her control. <br/><br/>Arthur North laughed, and he had always thought she was like a little wildcat. Peaceful and quiet when things were going well, cold and elegant, but when things went awry, she would reveal her claws and scratch people. <br/><br/>But this was not a little wildcat, this was clearly a little fox, a noble, cold, and tempting fox. <br/><br/>After Anisa Cooper and Melody Collins ended their phone call, Anisa handed the cell phone back to Daisy Zane, pacing anxiously around Daisy. <br/><br/>“Sister X, was it that producer who deliberately set you up when you refused to comply with him?” Anisa whispered. <br/><br/>Arthur North, who just promised to stay out of the matter, glanced at Anisa. <br/><br/>He was planning to look up the identity of the man in the screenshot, but Anisa directly blurted it out to him. <br/><br/>“No. He doesn’t dare.” Daisy Zane affirmed. <br/><br/>Arthur North raised an eyebrow at her side, intuitively knowing that this man must be quite miserable. <br/><br/>Just now, Anisa used Daisy’s cell phone to call Melody Collins. Now that the phone was back in her hand, Daisy flipped through the messages. <br/><br/>An unremarkable number had sent her two video clips. Updated from novelbIn.(c)om<br/><br/>It was Holt Lawrence’s new number. <br/><br/>She just remembered that she had blacklisted Holt’s number last time, and had not relisted it yet. <br/><br/>Holt Lawrence: [Surveillance footage of the hallway, as well as the changing room video.] <br/><br/>Daisy Zane hadn’t even mentioned it to him yet, but he had already thrown the evidence to her, obviously trying hard to please her. <br/><br/>Holt Lawrence: [The messages on the Internet were sent by Joseph Johnson’s wife. The screenshots were sent to her by a hacker hired by Clarissa Mason. Clarissa also had the hacker hack the hallway surveillance.] <br/><br/>So, he received the message a little late. As a result, the hot search had just ended when a call from his dad came in. <br/><br/>As soon as the call was connected, his dad scolded him: “John, what are you doing? Lucia’s situation has been online for 15 minutes, what are you doing? What is Maple Elite Entertainment doing?” <br/><br/>“Dad, I just received the news.” <br/><br/>“Hurry up and remove the message, it’s obviously fake,” Mark Anderson said over the phone. “What’s the atmosphere in your circle now, spreading rumors for no reason and being idle all day. It’s affecting the healthy development of young people.” <br/><br/>“Yes, I’ll think of a way right away,” John Anderson replied. <br/><br/>“John, you better behave. If I find out that she’s been bullied under your watch, or that you’re messing around, I’ll skin you.” <br/><br/>John Anderson: . I know, dad, aren’t you in the Imperial Capital?” <br/><br/>“What? Doesn’t the Imperial Capital have internet access?” <br/><br/>John Anderson: <br/><br/>“Hurry up and get to work, I don’t have time to chat with you.” Mark Anderson hung up after saying that. <br/><br/>John Anderson looked at his phone, unsure of what to feel for a moment. He even had trouble figuring out which was his dad’s child. <br/><br/>He looked at the message online again, found Melody Collins’ contact information, and made a phone call to ask about Daisy Zane’s situation. As a result, Melody Collins told him that it had been settled, and a statement from the company would suffice. <br/><br/>John Anderson once again wondered: What is Daisy Zane’s background? <br/><br/>Moreover, not long after, the hot search about Daisy Zane being an illegitimate daughter was taken down. However, even so, the Miles family was somewhat affected. <br/><br/>The matter of the screenshots was clarified, and their innocence was proven very quickly. But the situation with the illegitimate daughter was directly removed from the hot search, with no explanation, which meant it was implicitly accepted. <br/><br/>Melody Collins then immediately paid to control the comments. <br/><br/>The grievances of the older generation and their children should not be related, and the most innocent one was Daisy Zane. If she could choose her birth, she would be the least willing to face such an identity. <br/><br/>She also mentioned the self-protection of women as a relatively vulnerable group. <br/><br/>So, the finger of blame soon pointed at Johanes Miles. The most direct consequence was the falling stock prices of the Miles Group. <br/><br/>A few days after the incident, someone found out that the producer and investor information for the show “Fall of the Quince” had been changed to Allonzo Hobson. <br/><br/>If it was invested by Allonzo Hobson, given his fame and his character of promoting investment, people would definitely know about it. <br/><br/>So, this matter was still being discussed hotly on the internet. <br/><br/>However, what everyone didn’t know was that Joseph Johnson, the original producer, disappeared in the circle quietly. <br/><br/>For those who were familiar with Joseph Johnson, they recognized him as the pixelated person in the clarification video from Maple Elite Entertainment. They smelled some not-so-simple news about Daisy Zane. <br/><br/>But for others, they had no idea who Joseph Johnson had offended and got into trouble with. <br/><br/>Only Allonzo Hobson knew very clearly. <br/><br/>Whoever messed with Third Master Clark, how could the Third Master let them live in peace?\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
