Because he could easily see every word Charlotte typed by just glancing over.<br/><br/>He watched her type a very rude sentence, then delete it and replace it with a milder one.<br/><br/>This was a temporary solution, so she vented her anger on Facebook.<br/><br/>Even using words like “your daddy” was allowed.<br/><br/>She went head-to-head with a group of netizens, which was probably a first in this circle.<br/><br/>So... Charlotte’s phone kept receiving messages.<br/><br/>As she posted on Facebook, messages from Hill Dawson poured in, one after another.<br/><br/>Harton saw a notification saying that three photos had been sent, and then Hill sent a message saying, “I’ve got the knife to my throat already!”<br/><br/>“You see! It’s already there!”<br/><br/>“If I see one more post on your Facebook, you’ll only see me in your dreams!”<br/><br/>Probably fearing that she wouldn’t see the complete message, Hill deliberately divided his words into separate messages.<br/><br/>Charlotte sent another message, then clicked on Hill’s message and said, “Hold on, this is the last one.”<br/><br/>After sending the message, she clicked into Facebook, uploaded an audio recording, and added a specific date. It was a phone call recording from April 15th last year.<br/><br/>Having uploaded the recording, she tagged Johaness Miles, Miles Group, and Charles Hobson. Then she said, “It’s only been over three months since April 15th this year. Wishing you all sweet dreams every night in the future.”<br/><br/>After posting on Facebook, Charlotte pinned this post to the top.<br/><br/>Harton recalled the content of the recording; although it didn’t explicitly point out anything, it could sway public opinion.<br/><br/>Moreover, she wasn’t just venting online; her actions served as evidence that she was in the right in this matter.<br/><br/>Claudia Zane was innocent, so she could confront others unscrupulously.<br/><br/>She couldn’t shut everyone up, but she could give confidence to those who believed in her.<br/><br/>Upon arriving at the Research Institute, Harton and Charlotte both entered the laboratory.<br/><br/>Who is right and who is wrong... It’s hard to make a conclusion.<br/><br/>Many netizens have regained their rationality, but there are still many people who choose to believe Johanes Miles’ side.<br/><br/>But the more they find reasons to believe Johanes Miles in the comments section.<br/><br/>The more netizens feel like they are paid trolls.<br/><br/>They are controlling the comments.<br/><br/>Because Daisy Zane’s words about paid trolls on Facebook have made people start to slowly doubt Emily Lane’s statement.<br/><br/>Moreover, just when everyone was discussing the issue online, Jack Thompson’s wife posted a statement online.<br/><br/>She said that Jack Thompson had disappeared since yesterday afternoon, could not be contacted, and had already reported to the police.<br/><br/>One thing after another happening left netizens bewildered.<br/><br/>And soon the issue was divided into two camps.<br/><br/>One side doubted Johanes Miles, and the other side doubted Daisy Zane.<br/><br/>The entire Miles family is now staying in the Imperial Capital, and since the news broke yesterday, everyone at home has been paying attention to online news.<br/><br/>Since the recording appeared online, the Miles family began to panic a little.<br/><br/>“She actually recorded it!” Johanes Miles slapped the sofa and said.<br/><br/>“It’s not a big problem.” Old Master Miles said, “There is no specific direction in the recording, and it doesn’t count as evidence. We can completely say that we wanted to reconcile at first, but it was Daisy Zane who wanted to cut off all ties. It’s not irreparable yet.”<br/><br/>“Grandfather is right.” Amelia Miles said, “This has only caused a shift in public opinion, but without evidence, Daisy Zane cannot solve this issue.”<br/><br/>“Right.” Old Master Miles said, “Tomorrow, release her photos again. As long as her reputation is ruined, the Clark family will not always protect her. Now the Clark family is hot-searched, and they’ve been criticized all the time, that’s enough for the Clarks to dislike her.”<br/><br/>“As long as the Clark family abandons her, it will be much easier to deal with Daisy Zane alone.” Amelia Miles said softly, “All the identities of Flynn Ninevara and Clayson Ninevara are not worth mentioning.”<br/><br/>“Yes.” A calculating look filled Old Master Miles’ eyes, “For the Miles family to rise again, we not only need to restore their reputation but also need to get rid of Daisy Zane, otherwise, she will always be a stumbling block for the Miles family.”<br/><br/>Johanes Miles nodded.<br/><br/>Old Master Miles was silent for a while and then said, “Keep a close eye on Jack Thompson. When the storm has passed, send him abroad.”<br/><br/>Old Master Miles looked at Amelia Miles and said, “Amelia, it’s easier to send a living person abroad than to deal with a corpse. Once abroad, many things will be more convenient, and it will have nothing to do with us anymore.”<br/><br/>“I understand, Grandfather.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
