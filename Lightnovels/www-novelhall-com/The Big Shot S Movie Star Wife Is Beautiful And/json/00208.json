Let Ryan Easton keep an eye on the <br/><br/>F Continent.” <br/><br/>Hugo Clark glanced at Kevin. <br/><br/>His Third Uncle actually told her about Ryan Easton. <br/><br/>“Yes,” Daisy Zane said, “According to him, this report should be handed over to them in the same way as 319. Someone gives it to him, and then he passes it on to his superiors.” <br/><br/>“Edward Kirsten is too cautious. Almost all of the reports he uses are paper-based, and there won’t be any electronic versions,” Kevin said. <br/><br/>“Moreover, when something reaches his hands or he passes it on, it goes through multiple layers of people. This way, even if one layer is discovered, it won’t pose a direct threat to him.” <br/><br/>“Otherwise, do you think he can withstand my hacking?” Daisy Zane said indifferently. <br/><br/>Upon hearing her words, Kevin smiled faintly: “That’s true.” <br/><br/>“Brook Sister, are you this amazing? Have you ever tried hacking Celestial Pivot’s defense system?” Xavier Dominic suddenly said. “I think Brook Sister can definitely break through. That Nathan Ninevara’s system would be trash if it were up to Brook Sister.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane: ” words. ” She didn’t know whether to be happy or angry about his <br/><br/>“Brook Sister, you want to give it a try?” Xavier Dominic said excitedly. “Scare that money-loving Holt Lawrence, make the alarm ring throughout the Celestial Pivot tower building.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised her eyebrows, picked up her teacup with her slender fingers, and took a sip of tea. She casually said: “Too simple, no challenge. And... I’m afraid Holt Lawrence would cry.” <br/><br/>Hugo Clark: ‘ <br/><br/>Xavier Dominic’s mouth twitched twice. This was beyond arrogance; it was pure contempt. <br/><br/>Seeing her disdainful look, Kevin smiled again: “I will arrange for someone to go to Koymoon Island.” <br/><br/>“Mmm,” Daisy Zane replied. <br/><br/>“Let’s go, time to sleep.” <br/><br/>“Mmm.” <br/><br/>Xavier Dominic watched Kevin and Daisy Zane hold hands and walk downstairs. Then he looked at Hugo Clark and mimicked Kevin’s tone, patting him on the shoulder: “Let’s go, time to sleep.” <br/><br/>Hugo Clark glanced at him, then at his shoulder that was patted. He said disdainfully: “Get away from me.” <br/><br/>So she always kept her distance from Charles and Wilton, preparing early for their eventual separation, forcing them and Charles to adapt beforehand. <br/><br/>But things... had changed since Kevin’s appearance. <br/><br/>Not only did it change her mood, but it even changed her thoughts. <br/><br/>Even if she ends up dying in the end, she had spent a good time with Charles and Wilton. <br/><br/>She could teach Charles to accept death and face it calmly, rather than causing him psychological harm and becoming a lifelong burden because she was never by his side. <br/><br/>Also... she has a lover. <br/><br/>At this thought, Daisy smiled and said, “Okay, send some cheap, easy-to-raise ones.” <br/><br/>“Great... Actually, I think digging a pond in front of the villa would be a good idea,” Kevin said. “We can transplant some lotus flowers there.” <br/><br/>Daisy glanced at him, thinking he might be addicted to digging lotus ponds: “Forget it, there’s a lake in the backyard. Charles almost fell into it. If we add another pond, he’ll undoubtedly fall from the backyard into the front yard.” <br/><br/>Kevin lowered his head and laughed. <br/><br/>“What are you laughing at?” <br/><br/>“Suddenly I remembered what Charles looks like when he’s angry,” Kevin said. <br/><br/>“If he hears you teasing him like this, he will definitely get angry.” <br/><br/>“Though he’s young, his temper isn’t small,” Daisy said. “Nothing a good beating can’t solve.” <br/><br/>“So being a loving father will be my important duty in the future.” <br/><br/>Daisy glanced at him and said, “Hmm... the dream is quite beautiful.” <br/><br/>The two spoke leisurely and slowly as they walked to the front yard. <br/><br/>Daisy didn’t plan to stay and was about to leave directly. But just as they walked less than five meters in the front yard. <br/><br/>There was a noise at the entrance. <br/><br/>They both stopped and looked at the shadow screen at the entrance. <br/><br/>Soon, a beautiful woman with a long, straight black hair, willowy eyes, red lips, and a slender waist, carrying things in both hands, came around the screen and walked towards them. Even dressed in a simple outfit, her charm and sexiness were not hidden. <br/><br/>Daisy had seen her before, in the restroom of Doomsday Hotel. This woman seemed to be very close to Kevin’s mother, who called her “Clara Mitchell.” <br/><br/>Upon seeing the two together, Clara stopped for a moment, her expression somewhat surprised. But she soon recovered her polite smile and briskly walked over to them. <br/><br/>“Third Brother, you’re home,” she said..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
