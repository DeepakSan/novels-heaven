Ever since he sat down, his eyes had been glancing at Daisy and Kevin.<br/><br/>Watching their seemingly accustomed interaction.<br/><br/>Feeling stifled and furious inside his heart.<br/><br/>Seeing Daisy’s eyes shift to her glass of wine for the Nth time, Kevin said, “A little sip won’t hurt.”<br/><br/>Daisy withdrew her gaze but didn’t drink.<br/><br/>Kevin placed the deboned fish in front of her and said, “Little Girl, I suddenly had an idea.”<br/><br/>“You can keep it to yourself.” Daisy took a bite of the fish.<br/><br/>Kevin smiled and shared his idea, “If I drunk you under the table, would I be able to take you home tonight?”<br/><br/>“Third Master, first, you need to have a proper understanding of your alcohol tolerance.” Daisy said slowly.<br/><br/>Austin barely heard her voice and suppressed the corners of his mouth.<br/><br/>Kevin:<br/><br/>“Secondly ” Daisy looked at him and asked, “What would you take me home for?”<br/><br/>Kevin:<br/><br/>“Third Master, cherish your pre-wedding life.” Daisy patted his leg and spoke with a brotherly tone, “There’s not much left.”<br/><br/>Thinking about his limited pre-wedding life, Kevin suppressed the corners of his mouth but couldn’t help laughing.<br/><br/>A little past seven o’clock, everyone finished their meal and left.<br/><br/>Since the news online hadn’t died down, Allonzo Hobson asked Marsh Turner to take a couple of days off.<br/><br/>He didn’t need to return to school, so the only ones who needed to go back were Daisy, Turner Daniel, and George Dunn.<br/><br/>Kevin asked Allonzo to go back with the Turner family, so he drove the three of them back by himself.<br/><br/>Allonzo thought that Third Master Clark wanted to casually infuriate the young love rival.<br/><br/>By the end of the meal, the cheeks of the young love rival had turned green with anger.<br/><br/>A difference that belonged only to Kevin Clark.<br/><br/>It was hard to describe what was different, but it just felt different.<br/><br/>It seemed that in front of Kevin Clark, she would let her guard down.<br/><br/>The more Turner Daniel thought about it, the more depressed he became, and the more speechless he felt.<br/><br/>He thought that someone as intelligent as Daisy Zane should belong to his family.<br/><br/>But she was not from his family, and she already belonged to someone else.<br/><br/>And that man was the genius recognized by his father and grandfather, the top talent of the research institute.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane walked to the chair prepared for her by George Dunn, and after checking the time, asked Marsh Turner for William Butch’s contact information.<br/><br/>Whether it was the police or Austin Allen, they needed to talk to William Butch about the situation. She needed to talk to William Butch first.<br/><br/>As soon as Marsh Turner sent her the contact information, she glimpsed someone coming from the corner of her eye and turned her head to look.<br/><br/>She saw five people, each carrying two large bags of stuff, walking towards them.<br/><br/>The staff members immediately got up and walked over.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane saw the words “Doomsday Hotel” on the clothes of those five people.<br/><br/>She watched the staff member talk to the person at the front, and then they both looked at her.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane took a couple of steps towards them and asked, “What’s the matter?”<br/><br/>“Lady Zane, Third Master asked us to bring some drinks and snacks for the staff members,” one of them replied.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane glanced at the food and then at her phone. She had just received a message from Kevin Clark: [Use William Lane’s money. Saving his sister is not something a few meals can pay off.]<br/><br/>Daisy Zane smiled.<br/><br/>She had never cared about personal relationships, relying on Anisa Cooper and Hill Dawson to leave a good reputation for her in the past. When they were not around, Kevin Clark took over the job.<br/><br/>She was an artist and an actor. Reputation was important.<br/><br/>She looked at the staff and the people from the Doomsday Hotel and said, “Please help distribute these to everyone. Thank you for your hard work.”<br/><br/>The staff member swallowed hard, staring at the Doomsday Hotel logo on the packaging, unable to wrap his head around it.<br/><br/>This was something he could eat?<br/><br/>The service at the Doomsday Hotel was excellent. Not only did they personally deliver the items, but they also took everything out of the bags one by one.<br/><br/>The exquisitely wrapped portions looked like they were dishes at a royal banquet.<br/><br/>All the staff members stared at the Doomsday Hotel logo on each portion.<br/><br/>No one said a word until the people from the Doomsday Hotel had left.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane had already added William Butch as a friend and was chatting with him.<br/><br/>Then she suddenly heard Director Nash say, “Brook God...”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked up at him, and from his expression, she understood his thoughts. She said lightly, “Kevin Clark has quite a bit of money.”<br/><br/>Director Nash:<br/><br/>“Didn’t everyone skip dinner? The drinks should be hot,” Daisy Zane knew that the staff usually ate after returning to the dormitory in the evening. “Eat a little to get by for now.”<br/><br/>The program team: What a way to “get by.”<br/><br/>Using the things from the Doomsday Hotel to “get by.”<br/><br/>All this stuff would be enough for anyone present to spend randomly and then eat dirt for the next three years.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
