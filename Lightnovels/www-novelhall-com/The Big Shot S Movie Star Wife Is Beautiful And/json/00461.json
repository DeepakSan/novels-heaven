That was way too wide... Definitely not the 18-point they agreed on.<br/><br/>It was absolutely one and a half times more.<br/><br/>It was agreed to be uniform, but in the end, they adopted his preference.<br/><br/>Daisy took the mouse and quickly changed the less than 300-word report she had written back to 18-point spacing.<br/><br/>Harton Clark watched her series of operations and secretly laughed on the side. Although he didn’t laugh out loud, his whole body was shaking with laughter.<br/><br/>Daisy was sitting on his lap...<br/><br/>“What are you laughing at?”<br/><br/>Harton Clark immediately stopped laughing, “Nothing.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>Daisy stared at him lightly.<br/><br/>Harton Clark touched her face, gave a peck on the corner of her mouth, and softly said, “I wrote the report for you with 18-point line spacing.”U//ppTodated fr/o/m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)\\/m<br/><br/>Daisy continued to stare at him, “What’s the matter? You don’t like what I wrote?”<br/><br/>“Madam’s report is easy to understand, simple, clear, and can be considered exemplary,” Harton Clark responded.<br/><br/>Lucia listened as he praised her.<br/><br/>“However... we need a more complicated version,” Harton Clark said as he held her hand and whispered, “They might not understand it if it’s too simple.”<br/><br/>Less than 300 words, one could quickly read it from beginning to end.<br/><br/>There were even two sentences mixed in to raise the tone.<br/><br/>Daisy was silent for a moment then said, “Formality.”<br/><br/>“Madam is right,” Harton Clark replied as he moved his hand from around her waist and slipped it inside her clothes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Go out and play.”<br/><br/>“I’m going too.”<br/><br/>Daisy stopped, gave him a glance, and continued walking away without responding.<br/><br/>Charles followed her, grumbling, “This woman, I’ve been playing chess with her all morning, and she just abandons me.”<br/><br/>“Less than three hours,” Daisy corrected.<br/><br/>“I want to go out too.”<br/><br/>At the entrance, Daisy handed Charles his coat and said, “Put it on yourself.”<br/><br/>Little Charles immediately cheered up, put on his coat, and his shoes.<br/><br/>Daisy put on her coat and said, “First go to the front courtyard and tell grandparents we won’t be back for lunch.”<br/><br/>“Got it,” Charles said, “I’ll tell Uncle Clark, too.”<br/><br/>“Mhm.”<br/><br/>Daisy drove to the Doomsday Hotel to pick up Olivia.<br/><br/>When they arrived at the hotel, she didn’t let Charles get out of the car and went to find Olivia herself.<br/><br/>As soon as she saw Olivia, even before they could speak, Daisy noticed something was wrong with her.<br/><br/>Her gaze was off.<br/><br/>When did Olivia’s proud and arrogant eyes start to flicker and carry a hint of grievance?<br/><br/>Daisy approached her and asked, “Have you been waiting long?”<br/><br/>Olivia hung her head, and after a short while, she shook her head.<br/><br/>Daisy felt like Olivia knew something but pretended not to know. She didn’t expose her, and patted her head, “How come we’ve become so distant after a few days apart?”<br/><br/>“A few days?” Olivia replied, “It’s been more than two months. You don’t reply to messages or answer calls. I almost forgot who you were.”<br/><br/>“I was busy with something.”<br/><br/>Olivia didn’t say anything more.<br/><br/>Daisy said, “Let’s go, I’ll take you to see William Butch.”<br/><br/>Olivia followed her out.<br/><br/>As soon as the two walked out of the Doomsday Hotel, they saw a car parked at the entrance. Then... William Lane got out of the car.<br/><br/>The two stopped in their tracks.<br/><br/>Seeing them, William also paused for a moment. He finally saw his two sisters together again. He looked at them for a moment, then smiled, “Going out to play?”<br/><br/>In order not to put pressure on Daisy, Olivia acted as if she didn’t know anything. Suddenly, she took a step forward, stood between Daisy and William Lane, and seriously introduced, “Brother, this is... Daisy Zane. This is my brother, William Lane.”<br/><br/>Both William and Daisy looked at her.<br/><br/>Then Daisy lowered her head and laughed.<br/><br/>“What are you laughing at?” Olivia looked at her.<br/><br/>Daisy cleared her throat, “I didn’t laugh.”<br/><br/>Olivia:  Did she look that foolish?<br/><br/>Seeing Daisy laugh, William thought she probably saw through Olivia but didn’t expose her. He clenched his hand by his side and said, “Where are you going? I’ll take you there.”<br/><br/>As soon as Olivia heard, she immediately wanted to agree so the three siblings could be together, but she held her tongue and looked at Daisy.<br/><br/>Daisy saw the pleading hope in her eyes, hesitated, and looked at William, “Are you busy?”<br/><br/>“No, just routine check-ups. It doesn’t matter if it’s a day early or a day late.”<br/><br/>“Alright, let’s go together.”<br/><br/>Both William and Olivia smiled.<br/><br/>Daisy saw their happy faces and lifted the corner of her mouth, “We’ll use the car I brought. There’s a little one inside.”<br/><br/>Olivia: “Huh?”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
