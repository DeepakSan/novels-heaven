Once there, she realized that the Silver Palace was still fighting below with an injured leg, biting and tearing.<br/><br/>With its hind leg curled up, ready to attack at any moment, its fierce gaze, and wrinkled nose.<br/><br/>Its white fur was stained with blood.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane immediately walked down the slope while using her gun to take down the people surrounding Silver Palace.<br/><br/>Seeing they couldn’t win, two of the attackers turned to run.<br/><br/>Silver Palace instinctively wanted to chase them down.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane called out to it just in time: “Silver Palace!”<br/><br/>She used the masculine voice she had once used.<br/><br/>This time, Silver Palace did not pursue but immediately stopped.<br/><br/>“Silver Palace, come here.” Daisy Zane didn’t continue down but ran to a temporarily safe place a little distance to the side.<br/><br/>And Silver Palace immediately followed her.<br/><br/>However, after stopping with her, the wolf still looked at her somewhat guardedly.<br/><br/>It wasn’t until Daisy Zane squatted down, reached out, and called its name once more that Silver Palace approached and touched her fingertip with its nose.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane gently whistled again.<br/><br/>Silver Palace immediately let go of its guard completely and walked over to her side.<br/><br/>Its previously fierce green eyes softened.<br/><br/>It suddenly jumped onto Daisy Zane, like a large pet, rubbing its head against her face.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane stroked the fur on its neck and then had it lie down, checking out the wounds on its body.<br/><br/>Not only was it injured on its hind leg, but its front leg also had knife wounds, not very deep. It must have been injured by someone after rolling down the mountain slope.<br/><br/>Even though she was squatting and not looking up.<br/><br/>Eloquent eyes, emotions constantly churning in their depths. Likewise, many memories, even ones he couldn’t remember, images reappeared in his mind.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn’t look up, but she felt Kevin Clark’s reaction too.<br/><br/>This reaction... showed that the truth was in front of her eyes.<br/><br/>The person she respected, feared and didn’t dare to remember... was her husband.<br/><br/>And for Kevin Clark... the person he hated, the traitor who faked death and betrayed... was his wife.<br/><br/>After wrapping the wound, Daisy Zane touched Silver Palace’s head, regulated her heartbeat, and stood up to look at Kevin Clark.<br/><br/>Their gazes met, and Kevin Clark found a trace of fear in the depths of Daisy Zane’s calm eyes.<br/><br/>He felt a sudden pain in his heart.<br/><br/>Yoshua Archer and Edward Darkmoon were still astonished by whether she was Martin Hanzel or not, and whether Martin Hanzel was a woman.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at Yoshua Archer and Edward Darkmoon, then lowered her eyes and said to Kevin Clark, “Let’s deal with the immediate situation first.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s eyelashes blinked, and he took off his coat, stepping forward to drape it over Daisy Zane.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn’t move, but Kevin Clark felt her stiffness the moment he approached.<br/><br/>Yoshua Archer and Edward Darkmoon were even more confused now. What was going on? What happened?<br/><br/>“Put it on.” Kevin Clark said.<br/><br/>Daisy didn’t look at him, just lowered her eyes and put on the coat.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Allonzo Hobson’s voice came through Kevin Clark’s earpiece, “Kevin, we’re almost surrounded. We can start.”<br/><br/>Adrian Roberts’ voice immediately followed, “The east side is finished.”<br/><br/>The 12th Hall, responsible for the west side, also said, “The west side is finished too.”<br/><br/>Dark Radiance’s men came from four directions, enclosing and driving the Thousand Mountains Alliance and that unknown force continuously toward the central area.<br/><br/>So even if they tried to flee, there was nowhere to go.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark pressed his earpiece and said solemnly, “Start.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
