There’s a tea ceremony next week. We came early today to try out some new teas that just arrived.” <br/><br/>That’s why there were so few people in the tea house, as they were almost not open to the public in preparation for next week’s tea ceremony. <br/><br/>“We originally planned to bring Lucia to the tea ceremony next week.” Natalie Wayne said, “Are you guys nearby?” <br/><br/>“Just passing by.” Daisy Zane replied in a low voice. <br/><br/>Bonnie Maxwell gritted her teeth and took a deep breath when she noticed the Clark family surrounding Daisy Zane. <br/><br/>The two tea masters also comforted her and exchanged glances with each other. <br/><br/>“Lucia, let me introduce you.” Natalie Wayne stood by her side and introduced her, “This is your big brother. You’ve met before.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane: They’ve met who leaked the news? Did the Clark family know that she hit Theo Clark? <br/><br/>“Big brother.” She greeted softly, not revealing any awkwardness from her heart. <br/><br/>Theo Clark responded. <br/><br/>“This is your sister-in-law.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane: “Sister-in-law.” <br/><br/>Calvin Stewart looked at her, not as a sister-in-law, but more like a daughter-in-law. <br/><br/>After all, Kevin Clark was also raised by her. <br/><br/>She smiled and replied. <br/><br/>“What about me?” Hardy Clark said, “Grandma, why don’t you introduce me?” <br/><br/>Natalie Wayne glanced at her and said, “Don’t force me to dig up the past.” <br/><br/>Hardy Clark immediately behaved herself, pouting and standing next to Hugo Clark, but she couldn’t help but laugh again within two seconds. <br/><br/>Theo Clark and his family of four had come out of respect for Bonnie Maxwell’s father. <br/><br/>Now that Daisy Zane was here, it was not convenient for them to linger. <br/><br/>Yet Bonnie Maxwell interrupted her husband’s words. <br/><br/>Ezra Lin’s face was filled with coldness, just about to speak. But Daisy Zane spoke first: “Why don’t we taste it together?” <br/><br/>Elina Clark and Natalie Wayne both looked at her. <br/><br/>So did Charles Amos. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane pressed Charles Amos’s head back down and looked at Elina Clark and Natalie Wayne: “Uncle, Aunt, is it okay?” <br/><br/>“Of course, it’s fine.” Natalie Wayne said with a smile. <br/><br/>Elina Clark also nodded. <br/><br/>A momentary sinister smile flashed in Bonnie Maxwell’s eyes. <br/><br/>The group of people sat down at the tea table. <br/><br/>Since there were too many people, they split up and sat at two tea tables. The men at one table, the women at the other. <br/><br/>However, Kevin Clark followed Daisy Zane. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark pulled the chair open for Daisy Zane to sit down. As soon as Daisy Zane sat down, Charles Amos started rubbing and squeezing by her chair. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked down: “What are you doing?” <br/><br/>“I want to sit with you.” Charles Amos said. <br/><br/>Everyone looked at them. <br/><br/>“I think it’s crowded.” Daisy Zane replied softly. <br/><br/>“Then I can sit on your lap.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at him, then said after a pause, “Have a sense of your own weight.” <br/><br/>Natalie Wayne and Calvin Stewart both laughed.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
