Soon, red plum blossoms filled the branches.<br/><br/>At the peak of the plum blossom season, William Lane and Amelia Smith held their wedding ceremony.<br/><br/>William started preparing for the wedding since the day they received their marriage certificate. He spent many days making preparations as if he was always ready.<br/><br/>The blooming plum blossom and Amelia’s smile on that day finally determined the wedding date for William.<br/><br/>Ten miles of red makeup and a banquet for all to enjoy.<br/><br/>Several months later, the Imperial Capital welcomed another grand wedding.<br/><br/>This time, the wedding was held at the Doomsday Hotel, so everyone quickly guessed that it was the wedding of the eldest son of the Lane Family.<br/><br/>While netizens congratulated them, some fell into sorrow.<br/><br/>William Lane and Hugo Clark’s cp...is over!!!<br/><br/>[First, congratulations to Young Master Lane. Then...I want to say, weren’t the couple of Young Master Lane and Hugo broken up earlier? Didn’t the identity of Brook Sister, the eldest daughter of the Lane Family go public, and they broke up? Why are some still shipping them?]<br/><br/><br/><br/>[Congratulations to Young Master Lane on his wedding. Although...how do you know it’s not Hugo Clark and William Lane getting married?]<br/><br/>[Oh! my! God! Sisters! I suddenly don’t feel so sad anymore.]<br/><br/>[Hahahaha, I suddenly feel alive again.]<br/><br/>[All right, all right. Even though this is very entertaining, today is a joyous occasion. Let’s not make such jokes, it’s disrespectful to the bride.]<br/><br/>[That’s true...We all just want to have fun with the cp, and they can still be shipped even after getting married.]<br/><br/>[Yes, yes, yes. Bless Young Master Lane and the bride to be happy and harmonious, grow old together and have children soon.]<br/><br/>[Wow, don’t you think the online environment has been somewhat purified? Everyone is so harmonious.]<br/><br/>[It’s because we’re discussing the Lane Family, and our Brook Sister is the eldest daughter of the Lane Family. Our Brook Sister has a really powerful fan who can locate you based on your comments. If you were an online troll, wouldn’t you be afraid?]<br/><br/>[I’m scared, I’m really scared. I thought it was nothing to say something on the internet before, but now I’m genuinely afraid. I’m scared my phone would suddenly black out and start cursing me all day.]<br/><br/>[It’s only under the comment sections about Brook Sister on the entire internet where it’s so harmonious.]<br/><br/>[Trolls see it’s Brook Sister and walk around her.]<br/><br/>[I’ve seen a photo of Young Master Lane on the internet. He is incredibly handsome, with a cold yet gentle demeanor. Which sister with a blessed life caught his eye?]<br/><br/>[Ah—is there anyone who can read fortunes? Can you read if I have a fortune to marry into a wealthy family in this life?]<br/><br/>[I wonder if some photos will circulate online, I miss Brook Sister so much, it’s been so long since I’ve seen her.]<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>There’s a lively discussion online, while on William Lane’s side... He’s stuck at the entrance of the house while picking up the bride.<br/><br/>Amelia Smith was to marry from Sofia Smith’s rental house. William and his team originally planned to break in like Kevin Clark did, but after entering the living room, they found themselves stuck at the bedroom door. They miscalculated.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane is blocking the entrance...they couldn’t break in.<br/><br/>“Lila, I’m your biological brother.” William said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Based on their previous experience, they popped all the balloons in the room, causing a series of shrieks but no discoveries.<br/><br/>Seeing the slow progress inside, Kevin Clark in the living room looked at Charlotte Lane.<br/><br/>Charlotte touched the golden beans in the bag, glanced at Arthur, then looked at the ceiling.<br/><br/>Surprise flashed in Arthur’s eyes as he entered the bedroom and said, “James, the ceiling.”<br/><br/>William Lane was shocked.<br/><br/>James Lane’s usually stoic face twitched as he dismantled the ceiling and took out the shoes.<br/><br/>“Who thought of this?” Allonzo Hobson chuckled, “It’s brilliant.”<br/><br/>Arthur North replied, “What do you think?”<br/><br/>Allonzo Hobson looked at the seed-eating Robinson Scott by the door.<br/><br/>Robinson Scott met his gaze before quickly looking away, pretending as if nothing had happened.<br/><br/>Allonzo Hobson: “.......”<br/><br/>With the shoes on, Daniel Harrisonbless carried Amelia Smith into the car.<br/><br/>The wedding procession then proceeded grandly to the Doomsday Hotel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Doomsday Hotel was decorated with plum blossoms both inside and out. Real plum blossoms were used for the interior decoration.<br/><br/>Outside, a watercolor painting of plum blossoms adorned the entire exterior screen of the hotel.<br/><br/>Amelia Smith’s parents did not attend, leaving only her siblings present.<br/><br/>On the other hand, many people from the Lane family attended, and many prominent figures from the Imperial Capital were invited.<br/><br/>The wedding feast carried a joyous celebratory atmosphere while also showcasing Amelia Smith to everyone.<br/><br/>William Lane led Amelia Smith into the venue, with the wedding ceremony still hosted by George Dunn.<br/><br/>After the couple paid their respects to heaven and earth, William Lane got down on one knee and hurriedly placed the ring on Amelia’s hand.<br/><br/>He stood up, and amid the cheering and applause from below the stage, he gently held Amelia’s face and kissed her.<br/><br/>“Madam... Happy wedding,” he said, rubbing her cheek with his thumb and adding, “I love you.”<br/><br/>Light shimmered in Amelia’s eyes as she looked into William’s and, pausing for a moment, rose to her tiptoes to kiss William’s lips, whispering, “Brother, I love you too.”<br/><br/>She loved him so much.<br/><br/>For so many years.<br/><br/>Her whole youth had been dazzled by him.<br/><br/>Since their first meeting, William Lane seemed to be a single drop of ink that dripped into her plain life and closed heart. The drop quickly grew roots, sprouted, and bloomed into a beautiful flower that would continue to bear fruit.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Ink Splashed Plum Blossom (The End)<br/><br/>2022.09.30\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
