Seeing that he had nothing to hold onto, he sat up as well.<br/><br/>“Miss, turn around and let me look at your eyes.”<br/><br/>Daisy turned off the alarm on her phone, checked some messages, and then looked at Kevin when she saw there was nothing important.<br/><br/>Kevin looked at her eyes, which weren’t red anymore: “Do they still feel uncomfortable?”<br/><br/>“No,” Daisy looked at the wound on the corner of his mouth, which was almost healed, “It’s recovering pretty fast.”<br/><br/>“I’m a grown man; I can’t be bothered by a slap for several days,” Kevin laughed.<br/><br/>Hearing his words, Daisy raised her eyebrows.<br/><br/>Based on his sensitive skin that even a grip would leave a mark, she always felt that Kevin needed to be taken care of very carefully and treated like royalty.<br/><br/>“What’s with that look?” Kevin pinched her face.<br/><br/>Daisy raised her eyebrows again but said nothing. She got out of bed and walked straight to the restroom.<br/><br/>Kevin sat on the bed, watching her get out of bed without looking back or saying a word.<br/><br/>It was just like the attitude of a terrible woman who changes her mind once she gets out of bed.<br/><br/>With that thought, he chuckled and went to his own room to wash up.<br/><br/>At six twenty, they both set out. When they left, Gael Easton was still asleep and had no idea that the two people who made him worry last night had already left early.<br/><br/>Many parents still drop their kids off at school on Monday mornings.<br/><br/>So the entrance was still a bit congested.<br/><br/>Therefore, Daisy didn’t have Kevin drive to the entrance but parked in a quieter parking space behind the school.<br/><br/>Just after leaving the villa, Kevin had the Doomsday Hotel deliver breakfast to the school.<br/><br/>There was still some time before morning self-study.<br/><br/>So now, Daisy was having breakfast in the car.<br/><br/>“Who wants to chase her?”<br/><br/>William Lane laughed.<br/><br/>After opening the car door, Olivia Lane didn’t move. After a moment, she turned to William Lane and said, “Brother, I’m sorry. Don’t take what I said last night to heart. Actually, I’m quite happy that you’re back.”<br/><br/>As she spoke, she looked up at him, “Really, very happy.”<br/><br/>“Mm, I can see that,” William Lane smiled.<br/><br/>Seeing his smile, Olivia Lane also smiled, “Now that you’re back, shouldn’t you also consider finding a sister-in-law for me? Even Kevin’s Third Uncle has a girlfriend.”<br/><br/>“You must be an undercover agent that our parents have sent to spy on me.”<br/><br/>“You’re so old and still make them worry.”<br/><br/>“Fine,” William Lane smiled, “I’ll have to look around first.”<br/><br/>“Mm, then I’m leaving.”<br/><br/>“Go ahead.”<br/><br/>After Olivia Lane left, William Lane got out of the car and went to the back to get in Kevin Clark’s copilot seat.<br/><br/>Just as he sat down, he started with a clichéd remark: “Here to drop off your girlfriend?”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark immediately replied with another cliché: “Here to drop off your sister?”<br/><br/>William Lane:<br/><br/>Ignoring his expression, Kevin Clark replied while checking his cellphone messages, “What’s going on?”<br/><br/>“Wanna grab a drink?”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark paused mid-texting, glancing at him, “It’s early in the morning what’s gotten into you?”<br/><br/>“Going or not?”<br/><br/>“No time.” Kevin Clark looked at his phone again, “I have to go to the Research Institute.”<br/><br/>William Lane was silent for a moment before saying, “I’ll go with you. I haven’t done any experiments in a while; my hands have gotten a little rusty.”<br/><br/>William Lane had studied pharmaceutical formulation major in F Continent for eight years, from college to doctoral studies.<br/><br/>There wasn’t any special reason, he just happened to be studying there while looking for his sister, Charlotte Lane.<br/><br/>He dropped out after two years of college in his domestic country.<br/><br/>Pharmaceutical formulation is the best major in the F Continent. Starting from decades ago, this major has produced batch after batch of talents.<br/><br/>So, he chose this major.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark paused for a moment before directly locking his phone’s screen. He looked at William Lane again, and two seconds later, he finally asked, “What do you mean?”<br/><br/>“What you understand,” William Lane looked at him for a moment before lowering his gaze.<br/><br/>Now it was Kevin Clark’s turn to be silent.<br/><br/>Early in the morning, two handsome and attractive men sat silently in a car near a high school.<br/><br/>After a while, Kevin Clark’s eyelashes fluttered lightly and said, “Uncle Lane agreed.”<br/><br/>“Mm,” William Lane responded softly.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
