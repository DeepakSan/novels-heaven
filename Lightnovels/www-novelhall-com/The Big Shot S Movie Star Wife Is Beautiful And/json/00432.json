As he wiped the blood from under her eyes, he said, “Is Madam not planning to talk to me?”<br/><br/>Yoshua and Edward’s eyes had never been so wide open before.<br/><br/>They had heard that the Boss’s wife had arrived.<br/><br/>However, they hadn’t met her yet, and they hadn’t expected her to be the person in front of them.<br/><br/>Moreover, this person seemed to be Martin.<br/><br/>This, this, this...<br/><br/>Thomas Firway seemed to have no reaction, but Allonzo Hobson looked back, thinking the two had been quarreling.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane pursed her lips and remained silent.<br/><br/>The man who made her fear, respect, and be grateful to, had made her sleep.<br/><br/>It could be said that without Arthur North at that time, Daisy Zane would not exist now.<br/><br/>Martin, the Nameless of the Darknight Alliance, the Hundred Demons Pavilion... these were all based on that nearly one year of training.<br/><br/>Although Daisy Zane did not show it, the impact of this revelation was still significant for her.<br/><br/>She didn’t even know how to get along with Arthur North now.<br/><br/>Seeing her not speaking, Arthur North didn’t force it.<br/><br/>After he had wiped her hands and face clean, he held her hand and looked at Yoshua and Edward, saying, “My Lady.”<br/><br/>Yoshua and Edward stared at Daisy Zane, supposed to greet her, but the two brothers’ throats seemed to be pinched, unable to make a sound.<br/><br/>Instead, Daisy Zane looked at the two of them, paused for a moment, and said softly, “It’s been a long time.”<br/><br/>Thomas Firway understood right away.<br/><br/>Martin Hanzel carried the crime of treason.<br/><br/>If pursued, even if they didn’t die... they would probably be crippled.<br/><br/>Should they pursue, it’s their boss’s wife. If not, how would they set rules and satisfy the public? Would anyone be able to leave at any time?<br/><br/>So, they must stop spreading this issue.<br/><br/>Thomas Firway nodded, showing that he understood. Only then did Yoshua let him go.<br/><br/>Then the three of them went to work separately.<br/><br/>Back in the room, Kevin Clark took Daisy Zane directly to the restroom. He took off her coat and threw it on the ground, lifting her onto the washbasin.<br/><br/>He squeezed in between her legs, looking down at her.<br/><br/>Daisy unconsciously moved back a bit, but Arthur North held her waist.<br/><br/>“Are you afraid of me?” Arthur North asked her.<br/><br/>The hands that Daisy placed on the washbasin clenched slowly.<br/><br/>“Little girl, look at me.”<br/><br/>Daisy didn’t move.<br/><br/>Arthur North held her chin, making her look up at him, “Little girl, I am Arthur North, just Arthur North to you.”<br/><br/>Daisy looked at the gentle expression in his eyes.<br/><br/>“The terrible, cold-blooded person you once knew will never appear in front of you again,” Arthur North gazed deeply at her. After a pause, he whispered, “Can you not be afraid of me?”<br/><br/>Daisy looked at him.<br/><br/>Her reactions had been calm from the start, and it was impossible to see any emotional fluctuations.<br/><br/>But Arthur North sensed it; she was a little afraid of him. Even... she was no longer close to him.<br/><br/>Even though they were together, he felt the distance between them had grown.<br/><br/>It took Daisy a while before she lowered her gaze, resting her forehead on his shoulder.<br/><br/>Arthur North immediately held her, kissing her ear.<br/><br/>The two of them held each other in silence, listening to each other’s heartbeat.<br/><br/>As the time slowly passed, Daisy moved a bit and leaned on his shoulder, saying, “I’m sorry. I have something I must do, and I can only leave.”<br/><br/>“I know.” Arthur North stroked her head, “You don’t need to apologize. And don’t worry, I’ll handle everything.”<br/><br/>Daisy understood his meaning, “You’re planning to bend the rules.”<br/><br/>Arthur North laughed lightly and said, “What’s wrong with bending some rules for my own wife?”<br/><br/>Daisy chuckled.<br/><br/>“You are Mrs. Clark,” Arthur North said, “No one dares to touch you.”<br/><br/>No one could touch you.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
