Kevin Clark followed her inside, saying, “Everything inside has been handled, just a routine procedure; they need to ask you some questions.”<br/><br/>“Okay,” Daisy Zane replied.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark glanced at her, and after a while, his reddish thin lips pursed lightly and asked, “Are you angry?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked up at him and saw his suddenly flustered color and traces of regret. After a moment, she said, “Yeah.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s heart sank. His tone just now was too heavy, “I ”<br/><br/>“There’s an ice cream shop a kilometer away from here.” Daisy Zane expressionlessly interrupted him, “We passed it just now.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s words were stuck in his mouth. It was stuck, and his throat hurt a bit.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at him.<br/><br/>After a few seconds of eye contact, Kevin Clark gritted his teeth, sensing that he had fallen into a trap. But if he refused, the little girl might really get angry, “I’ll buy it for you on the way back.”<br/><br/>“I’ve been craving it since we left.”<br/><br/>Hearing her words, Kevin Clark suddenly chuckled. The little girl’s rare willfulness.<br/><br/>Although her tone and demeanor haven’t changed, he thought that the little girl should be like this.<br/><br/>Being pampered loved, a bit capricious, a bit self-centered.<br/><br/>Just like in Continent A, her playful banter with Edward Kirsten.<br/><br/>“I’ll accompany you in, explain the situation, and you cooperate with the investigation. I’ll go out to buy it in the meantime.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane nodded her head, turned around, and walked towards the police station. As she turned around, the corners of her lips curved up for a moment.<br/><br/>The police station’s inquiry went quickly, while Kevin Clark’s ice cream purchase took much longer, with a long queue.<br/><br/>So by the time Kevin Clark returned to the police station, Daisy Zane was already waiting at the entrance.<br/><br/>“Right, right.”<br/><br/>“Yes, yes. We shouldn’t have talked nonsense.”<br/><br/>“What nonsense did you talk about?” Director Nash asked curiously.<br/><br/>“We ” One of the boys glanced at the people sitting around the table and didn’t know how to start.<br/><br/>“They said Kevin Clark likes to play around, is fickle, and there is a constant stream of women around him,” Daisy Zane said indifferently.<br/><br/>“Ahem! Ahem, ahem...” Director Nash choked on his wine, looking at them in disbelief.<br/><br/>Who gave you daring...<br/><br/>The legs of the three standing guys felt somewhat weak.<br/><br/>They finally made it to today, and because of one sentence they were afraid that not only their careers would be ruined, but even their lives might be in danger.<br/><br/>“Brook, Brook God We were wrong.” The boy held his wine, “Brook God, I’ll take three drinks as punishment.”<br/><br/>As he spoke, he was about to tilt his head back and drink the wine.<br/><br/>But Daisy Zane stopped him with a gesture.<br/><br/>The boy sensed that there was no room for negotiation and his heart sank even further.<br/><br/>It’s over, it’s over, it’s all over...<br/><br/>Everyone was looking at her.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked up at the three of them and said, “Kevin Clark His reputation indeed isn’t great.”<br/><br/>The three boys were somewhat confused.<br/><br/>Celeste Martin was also looking at her. She thought to herself: Knowing he has a bad reputation, and still cozying up to him is because she sees his identity or the background he has.<br/><br/>“But rumors can’t be trusted,” Daisy Zane slowly said.<br/><br/>The three boys were stunned for a moment, then immediately echoed, “Yes, yes, you’re right. Rumors can’t be trusted, can’t be trusted.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
