Who do you think you are? Do you think you can leave here alive? Do you still think you’re Mrs. Clark? Do you think Kevin Clark can protect you?”<br/><br/>With a forceful twist, Charlotte Lane broke her arm.<br/><br/>Amelia Miles’ screams echoed throughout the reception room. Her entire body trembled in pain.<br/><br/>But her arm was still in Charlotte’s grip, not released.<br/><br/>As Liam Davis tried to save Amelia from Charlotte, William Lane stepped in front of him.<br/><br/>Liam looked at William and hesitated before saying, “Young Master Lane, at this point, can you still protect her?”<br/><br/>“You can try to see if I can.”<br/><br/>“Young Master Lane, how much is brotherhood worth?” Liam stood straight, looking at him, “You value Kevin Clark so much, but what about him? Even dead, he’s just a pile of bones, and you won’t get a single thing from him. Why bother?”<br/><br/>William didn’t speak, but a mocking smile flashed across his face.<br/><br/>“Young Master Lane, honestly, I don’t want to fight you.”<br/><br/>As soon as Liam’s words fell, Charlotte kicked Amelia away.<br/><br/>With a full-force kick, Amelia flew out and smashed into a vase half their height.<br/><br/>The vase shattered, and Amelia’s face was cut by the shards. Blood immediately flowed from the wound, which ran from the corner of her mouth to her temple.<br/><br/>Amelia lay motionless on the broken pieces, unable to move at first, but a few seconds later, she curled up, holding her face and groaning in pain.<br/><br/>Everyone in the reception room, including those guarding outside, was momentarily stunned.<br/><br/>Liam then yelled at Charlotte, “Daisy Zane!”<br/><br/>As he shouted the three words, he immediately engaged in a fight with Daisy.<br/><br/>But William stood in front of Charlotte and struck first.<br/><br/>In the past, Liam was a typical playboy, learning some martial arts only after arriving on the M Continent.<br/><br/>However, his rise to power was due to his ruthlessness and cunning tactics, not his fighting skills.<br/><br/>In terms of hand-to-hand combat, Liam was no match for William, even three times over.<br/><br/>Liam lost a tooth from a single punch, and he slammed into the door behind him.<br/><br/>Seeing he couldn’t win, he stopped fighting and retreated behind the door, holding his face as he said, “William Lane, think it through. This is the Platinum Burke Family’s territory, and with the few people you brought, you won’t be able to leave alive.”<br/><br/>William lowered his gaze, dusted off his sleeve, and said softly, “How can we know without trying?”<br/><br/>“Fine, you brought this on yourself.” Liam finished speaking and immediately gave an order.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Daisy would definitely use a combination of inside and outside forces to attack the Burke family.<br/><br/>That’s why they intercepted Dark Radiance reinforcements on the road.<br/><br/>Liam curled his lips and thought: Alice knew Daisy too well, calculating her every move so precisely.<br/><br/>Apart from wanting a share in the Mountain Sea Continent, Alice’s only condition to collaborate with Liam was taking Daisy’s life.<br/><br/>So today, everyone could leave, but Daisy had to stay.<br/><br/>“Daisy Zane, I suggest you give up soon,” Liam suddenly shouted, “Dark Radiance reinforcements won’t come. No matter how skilled you are, with so few people, eventually, you’ll get exhausted. It’s all the same result, so why struggle in vain?”<br/><br/>Charlotte paid no attention to his words and continued to knock down one opponent after another.<br/><br/>Not even three seconds passed after Liam’s statement before they heard the sound of helicopters.<br/><br/>The sounds grew louder and closer, and it seemed like there were many of them.<br/><br/>Liam and the Burke housemaster looked up at the sky.<br/><br/>However, they saw nothing but heard someone rush in to report.<br/><br/>“Outside, so many helicopters have arrived, and many people have come down, surrounding the place!”<br/><br/>Liam frowned, “Is it Dark Radiance?”<br/><br/>“Not just Dark Radiance. The Hundred Demons Pavilion as well. Dark Radiance only has helicopters, but the Hundred Demons Pavilion has forces on the ground and in the air.”<br/><br/>The housemaster’s face changed dramatically, “Hundred Demons Pavilion?!”<br/><br/>“Yes. Judging by their clothing colors, Logan, Samuel Gray, and Damian Brown have all brought people.”<br/><br/>The housemaster’s legs suddenly weakened.<br/><br/>Liam’s face also changed.<br/><br/>The housemaster grabbed Liam’s arm and said, “Liam, quickly ask Lady Alice for support! Hurry! Or else the Burke Family will be finished!”<br/><br/>Alice had been at the Burke family for a few days, and many of her people were with her.<br/><br/>Liam and his associates had been traveling between the M Continent and Mountain Sea Continent, bringing people over under the Burke family’s name.<br/><br/>That’s why the Burke family dared to make such a fuss.<br/><br/>However, Alice had said that if everything went smoothly, she wouldn’t intervene.<br/><br/>But now, their situation was far worse than they had imagined.<br/><br/>So Liam immediately contacted Alice and moved a large number of people to the periphery.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
