Be more dignified.” <br/><br/>“Nothing.” Hardy Clark said, becoming slightly more well-behaved, but still looking at the people coming and going in the hall. <br/><br/>Calvin Stewart also followed his gaze and then looked at Natalie Wayne: “Mom, do you think Third Brother came with his girlfriend? He usually doesn’t attend such events.” <br/><br/>Having heard this, Bonnie Maxwell’s expression became slightly stiff. <br/><br/>Natalie Wayne was also looking at the attendees, searching for Kevin Clark’s figure: “He must have. Otherwise, why would he be here? He always refuses to accompany me to parties.” <br/><br/>Calvin Stewart laughed: “Mom, are you jealous?” <br/><br/>Natalie Wayne smiled and spoke softly: “I’m not jealous. I’m just curious about what kind of woman could make him submit. <br/><br/>“A very beautiful one...” Calvin Stewart smiled, “One Theo Clark can’t defeat.” <br/><br/>Bonnie Maxwell slowly clenched her fingertips. How could Theo Clark not defeat Daisy Zane? With her thin arms and legs, Theo could snap her in half with one hand. <br/><br/>Everyone believed Theo Clark’s polite remarks too seriously. <br/><br/>If Daisy dared to challenge her, she would definitely be able to pin her down, leaving her with no chance to fight back. <br/><br/>“The more you describe her, the more curious I become. I can’t imagine her at all.” Natalie Wayne said. <br/><br/>Calvin Stewart held Natalie Wayne’s hand and said: “Maybe she’s Mulan Liam or Grace Miller. After all, Third Brother’s taste must be good.” <br/><br/>“I can’t even imagine someone who could catch her eye.” <br/><br/>While the two were casually chatting, Hardy Clark suddenly spotted Daisy <br/><br/>Zane’s figure. His eyes lit up and he turned to his mother: “Mom, Grandma, I see someone I know. I’m going to say hello.” <br/><br/>“Go ahead, go ahead,” Natalie Wayne said. <br/><br/>“Be more dignified.” Calvin Stewart reminded, “You’re a grown-up.” “I know.” As he responded, Hardy Clark had already run off. <br/><br/>“The entertainment industry is quite open.” Clara Mitchell said, “Everyone’s very open to having fun, and it’s all the usual stuff, nothing else. They’re all young, without restraint, so they naturally like to play.” <br/><br/>Calvin Stewart looked at Daisy Zane in the distance again, seeing his daughter talking to her continuously, and said: “She doesn’t look like someone who would be affected by those vulgarities.” <br/><br/>As Natalie Wayne looked up, Daisy Zane and Hardy Clark had already left, and they soon disappeared from their sight. She whispered softly: “Painting a tiger’s skin is easy but not its bones, knowing a person’s face is easily done, but not their heart.” <br/><br/>Hearing her say this, a hint of a smile crossed Clara Mitchell’s eyes. <br/><br/>Calvin Stewart didn’t say anything more either, and he felt that Natalie Wayne’s words just now were profound, not necessarily meant for anyone in particular. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane accompanied Hardy Clark to eat something, and after a while, she went to the restroom by herself. <br/><br/>As she came out of the restroom stall, Daisy Zane was about to go outside to wash her hands when she suddenly heard voices from the farthest stall in the restroom. <br/><br/>“Liam Davis, let me tell you, come here right now. Young Miss Lane is here at the showground, come over and meet her right away.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane had no interest in what others were saying but stopped in her tracks when she heard the words “Young Miss Lane”. <br/><br/>Mrs. Davis, in the restroom partition, lowered her voice and said: “I just saw Miss Lane, she’s very beautiful, much more beautiful than Daisy Zane. You come over right now! If you can’t see her tonight or get her contact information, where will you find her in the future! ‘ <br/><br/>Not knowing what Liam Davis said on the other side, Mrs. Davis’s voice became even more urgent. <br/><br/>“What’s so good about that Daisy Zane! No education and such a terrible background. It doesn’t matter if she’s an illegitimate daughter! Can such a good person come out of a place like Cold Green Village that can’t even be helped by poverty alleviation! You really lost your mind! What kind of love potion soup did she give you...” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn’t listen to the rest, she went out of the restroom to the sinks outside, lowered her eyes, and washed her hands slowly. <br/><br/>She waited until Mrs. Davis came out of the restroom, then turned off the faucet, and looked up at Mrs. Davis through the mirror. <br/><br/>Mrs. Davis, dressed in dazzling jewelry, was taken aback when she saw Daisy <br/><br/>Zane and immediately put on a haughty demeanor. <br/><br/>It seemed as if she didn’t care about anything around her. <br/><br/>“Oh, you’re here too.” Mrs. Davis went to the sink next to her to wash her hands, and said in a pretentious tone, “With the little money you make from your acting, you must’ve spent it all just to have the qualification to enter.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane flicked the water off her hands and took a tissue from the side to wipe them. <br/><br/>Then she turned her head to look at her and said: “I have some advice for Mrs. <br/><br/>Davis, as soon as you leave here, leave the venue immediately. Otherwise... you might be thrown out later.” <br/><br/>Mrs. Davis scoffed, “Do you think this Doomsday Hotel is yours, or that Cloud Clothing and Rainbow Skirts is yours? Can you just throw whoever you want <br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn’t care about her words, a faint smile on the corner of her mouth, but the cold knives in her eyes said: “And some more advice, control your mouth in the future. If I hear another word insulting Daisy Zane, I promise to make you watch your son and the entire Davis family crumble before you.” <br/><br/>“Who do you think you are, you...” Mrs. Davis didn’t finish her sentence when someone came in, and she stopped talking. <br/><br/>She just glared at Daisy Zane and left, stomping in her high heels. <br/><br/>As Daisy Zane watched her retreating figure, a fleeting look of desolation crossed her eyes, and she took out her cell phone to call Juan Wright...\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
