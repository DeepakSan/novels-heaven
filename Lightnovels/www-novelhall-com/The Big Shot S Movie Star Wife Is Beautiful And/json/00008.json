Kevin Clark's reputation wasn't that good. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark was born quite late, by the time he was born, his big brother's child was already two years old. <br/><br/>It was rumored that the Clark Family doted on their youngest son to the extreme. <br/><br/>So much so that they spoiled him rotten. <br/><br/>Very few had seen Kevin Clark's true appearance, but a widely circulated saying about him stated that Third Master Clark was idle, fond of wine and women, and ruthless. He spent his days guarding dozens of acres of lotus flowers like treasures, acting like a spendthrift. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane was not sure about the other rumors, but she was sure that Kevin Clark wasn't that idle. <br/><br/>\"So, Lady Zane has also heard of it.\" Kevin Clark took a sip of his wine. <br/><br/>\"I heard a bit about it.\" <br/><br/>\"Actually, many of these rumors are not true.\" Kevin Clark had never paid attention to these rumors that had been circulating for more than a decade, but now he suddenly felt the need to explain. <br/><br/>\"For example?\" <br/><br/>\"For example...\" Kevin Clark shook the red liquid in the wine glass with his long fingers, \"Today is the first time I've had a drink alone with a girl.\" <br/><br/>The tone was very serious, without any frivolous teasing. Coupled with his already pleasant voice, it was very soothing to listen to. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane had no resistance to his face, and his voice... <br/><br/>She was a little curious about how there could be a person whose every feature hit her aesthetic sweet spot. <br/><br/>After looking at him for a while, Daisy Zane reached out and clinked glasses with him: \"Congratulations on your first.\" <br/><br/>Kevin Clark was amused by her and laughed, the red wine in the glass trembling along with his laughter: \"Thank you. It's an honor.\" <br/><br/>Kevin Clark didn't stay long. After finishing his glass, he left. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane sent him off at the door, and after returning to the living room, she glanced at the wine glass on the tea table before heading back to her room to sleep. Trace back the roots of this material to n0v$lbin<br/><br/>... <br/><br/>The next day, Daisy Zane slept until past eleven o'clock. If it weren't for the knocking on the door waking her up, she would probably sleep until the afternoon. <br/><br/>She groggily opened the door to see Robinson Scott standing at her entrance, still wearing his mask, and his revealed eyes were shining brightly. <br/><br/>Instead, this was a mysterious and inscrutable tiger. <br/><br/>... <br/><br/>Over at the Miles Family, Old Master's birthday went without grand celebrations. The Hobson and Miles families wanted to take this opportunity to have a meal together with the Anning Faction, hoping to strengthen their bond and inquire about a piece of land in Truro City, eager to learn the government's intentions. <br/><br/>However, they didn't know Harry Anderson well enough. He is famous for his integrity and impartiality since joining politics. <br/><br/>Let alone their relative status, he hasn't even given favors to his own brothers over these many years. <br/><br/>It's not a groundless rumor that relatives say he's cold-blooded and ruthless. <br/><br/>Even in dealing with his son, John Anderson, their relationship is clearly divided due to John's startup. <br/><br/>When seeing his son, he would advise him to behave, otherwise, he would be ruthless towards his own kin. <br/><br/>So, the Miles and Hobson families tried beating around the bush during the meal but got nothing out of Harry Anderson. When they wanted to inquire further, Harry skillfully blocked their attempts. <br/><br/>Having traveled a long way from the Imperial Capital, the Hobson family was frustrated, yet they still had to smile and keep up appearances. <br/><br/>After dinner, the three families left, with the Miles and Hobson families heading to the parking lot. Harry Anderson had to go to another city later, so he stayed behind to talk to his son, John Anderson. <br/><br/>... <br/><br/>Parking Lot <br/><br/>Amelia Miles held her mother's hand and chatted with her uncle, her voice sweet and delicate: \"Uncle, Uncle Anderson also has his difficulties. When you hold a high position, you're under close scrutiny.\" <br/><br/>\"Hmph, he's just inflexible, lacking adaptability, and not knowing how to prioritize. Don't our family's high status secure his position in the future? \" <br/><br/>\"Uncle, don't be angry,\" Amelia Miles said, \"I will find an opportunity to ask again.\" <br/><br/>\"Yes, brother,\" Amelia's mother said, \"Amelia is about to marry into their family, so we'll be one big family. No matter how stubborn he is, he can't possibly neglect his own son, right? Blood is thicker than water.\" <br/><br/>\"Our Amelia is just so capable, marrying so well.\" <br/><br/>\"Isn't it because of the good genes from our family?\" Amelia Miles laughed obediently, quickly cheering up the Hobson family with a few words. <br/><br/>As the two families talked and laughed, moving towards the parking lot, Amelia Miles suddenly noticed someone standing next to a car not far ahead, facing away from them and making a phone call: \"Hey? Isn't that my sister?\" <br/><br/>At her words, everyone turned to look. <br/><br/>Johanes Miles' face immediately crumbled. <br/><br/>\"Sister?\" Amelia's uncle squinted for a closer look, \"That... what's her name, Tang... Tang... Daisy Zane?\" <br/><br/>\"Yes.\" Amelia answered, then suddenly raised her voice and called out, \"Sister!\" <br/><br/>Her voice echoed loudly in the empty parking lot, resounding with a faint echo. <br/><br/>Johanes Miles was already in a bad mood. Seeing her only made it worse. He originally wanted to pretend not to see her and let her leave, but Amelia suddenly called out; he didn't even have time to stop her.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
