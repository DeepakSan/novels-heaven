In this way, you will be a family in the eyes of the law.”<br/><br/>Charles Amos’s eyes moved, and then he laughed a little and said, “That doesn’t seem too bad.”<br/><br/>“Exactly.” Natalie Wayne said warmly.<br/><br/>Charles Amos smiled and added, “Grandpa, Grandma. My mom, she is a very special good girl. She is very, very outstanding, super intelligent, she can do anything. Although she looks cold and distant, in fact, she values feelings very much.”<br/><br/>Elina Clark and Natalie Wayne looked at each other again.<br/><br/>“My background is a bit complicated. She didn’t have to raise me originally. But because my father helped her, she has been taking care of me since she was a teenager.” Charles Amos said, “A young girl took care of me, and though Grandpa Edwards assisted, it was still not easy. Many people would criticize her because of me. But she is very strong and powerful. She is really great.” Charles Amos was not only mature but also had a fast-developing mind despite his short stature.<br/><br/>He knew a lot of things from a very young age.<br/><br/>So, he rarely called Daisy Zane “mom” in public.<br/><br/>It was only after he became familiar with people like Arthur North, Michael Jackson, and Juan Wright that he started calling Daisy Zane “Mom” in front of them.<br/><br/>Natalie Wayne patted his head, feeling sorry for this child: “We know. She’s a very good girl, and because you’re so outstanding, she must be outstanding as well. ”<br/><br/>“I’m still young, I can try harder.”<br/><br/>Natalie Wayne and Elina Clark both laughed: “You are indeed still young, but you’re already outstanding.”<br/><br/>Charles Amos showed a small, toothy smile: “Grandpa, Grandma. You have to help me keep this secret. If she finds out that I said these things, she’ll be angry.”<br/><br/>“What will happen if she gets angry? Will she hit people?” teased Natalie Wayne.<br/><br/>Charles Amos pursed his lips and whispered, “She won’t hit people casually.” Natalie Wayne laughed again, touched by Charles Amos’s cuteness.<br/><br/>“You know she’ll be angry, but you still tell us.” Natalie Wayne laughed.<br/><br/>“I don’t want her to be implicated because of me.” Charles Amos pouted.<br/><br/>“Oh, my dear, how could you implicate her?” Natalie Wayne put him on her lap and touched his face, “We can’t wait to like you furthermore.”<br/><br/>“I like Grandpa and Grandma too.” Charles Amos smiled, “I also like Uncle,<br/><br/>Auntie, Brother Enamel, and Sister Lily.”<br/><br/>“You don’t leave anyone out.”Rêạd new chapters at novelhall.com<br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn’t look up from the test paper.<br/><br/>Today’s English class was about the homework assigned yesterday.<br/><br/>As Turner Daniel and Olivia Lane predicted, ten minutes into the class, everyone fell asleep.<br/><br/>The warm sunshine outside shined in, and the only sound in the classroom was the teacher’s voice.<br/><br/>The atmosphere grew heavier and heavier.<br/><br/>Daisy supported her chin with one hand, held a pen in the other, and drew a portrait of Olivia, who had closed her eyes, on the test paper with her peripheral vision.<br/><br/>After a while, while she was drawing enthusiastically, the teacher suddenly called her name.<br/><br/>“Daisy Zane.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s pen stopped, and she raised her eyes to look at the teacher.<br/><br/>The teacher smiled gently at her and then said, “Please read the following passage.”<br/><br/>Having not heard where the teacher left off, Daisy Zane stood up after looking at the test paper.<br/><br/>Hearing her name, Olivia Lane opened her eyes, glanced at the teacher, and then at the standing Daisy Zane. She then asked, “Which part?”<br/><br/>The boy behind her shook his head, “I didn’t hear.”<br/><br/>Olivia Lane:<br/><br/>Turner Daniel, who had just been startled awake, wanted to ask William where they were, but as soon as he showed signs of speaking, William instinctively dodged and shrank inward.<br/><br/>Turner Daniel stretched his neck to look at the test paper of a student across the aisle.<br/><br/>Jessica Maxwell scoffed as she watched Daisy Zane stand up and said, “Let’s see her make a fool of herself.’<br/><br/>Upon hearing her words, Celeste Martin lowered her eyes without saying anything.<br/><br/>The people around were somewhat flustered, but Daisy Zane stood very calmly.<br/><br/>Just as she was about to open her mouth to ask where to start reading, she saw William pull the test paper aside slightly, then circled the third paragraph of the second article in the reading comprehension section with his pen.<br/><br/>She swallowed her words, and since the test paper was on this side, she picked it up, shook it, and read: “Some people seem willing to work around the clock...”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s voice was clear and cold, like winter snow, cool and refreshing.<br/><br/>It was aloof, untouchable, yet very pleasing to the ear.<br/><br/>Her pronunciation was also very standard, with a unique accent that sounded like a London accent but didn’t quite resemble it.<br/><br/>Upon hearing her voice, those who were dozing off suddenly woke up, staring at her in amazement and listening to her voice..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
