Thank you all for your love and support.”<br/><br/>Applause erupted from the audience below as Kevin Clark sat and watched his little girl on stage.<br/><br/>The camera deliberately captured him.<br/><br/>“Also, I’d like to take this opportunity to clarify something for everyone. It’s regarding the issue that Charlotte Lane is not Daisy Zane.” Due to the echo in the conference hall, Charlotte paused for a moment.<br/><br/>During that pause, Kevin noticed a white butterfly that had flown onto the stage, circled around Charlotte, and landed on the trophy in her hand.<br/><br/>“I’m indeed not her, but we’re inseparable forever. Daisy’s dream was to stand here.” Charlotte’s gaze fell on the butterfly, and her hand gripping the trophy involuntarily tightened. Swallowing her emotions, she continued, “Today, I’ve brought her here with me.”<br/><br/>Both the audience at the venue and those watching the live stream listened to her speak in silence.<br/><br/>“In the future... we’ll go even further together.” Charlotte looked into the camera, then addressed a question that had been on everyone’s mind, “Charlotte Lane has never entered the entertainment industry, just as... Daisy Zane will never leave it. Let’s all look forward to better works from Flynn Ninevara and Lady Zane. Thank you, everyone.”<br/><br/>Having said that, she bowed deeply to the audience below.<br/><br/>As she bent down, the butterfly circled her once more.<br/><br/>Charlotte straightened up and walked off the stage in the direction the butterfly flew away.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kevin also went in that direction.<br/><br/>Getting off the stage from the side, Charlotte was about to head backstage when she saw Kevin waiting for her. She walked straight to him and leaned into his embrace.<br/><br/>[To the sister above, be careful tonight. Don’t sleep too deeply, or Third Master might assassinate you in your sleep.]<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Two days after the award ceremony, the Research Institute announced the record of Victoria Zane.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And conferred upon Victoria Zane and her husband the Institute’s Medal.<br/><br/>Moreover, this was something Dean Yue had already arranged before his death, only waiting for an opportune time to announce it.<br/><br/>Upon the announcement, netizens were dumbfounded.<br/><br/>[Isn’t that Daisy Zane’s grandmother??????]<br/><br/><br/><br/>[So... the grandmother went into hiding in Cold Green Village so that her invention wouldn’t be used for human experimentation?]<br/><br/>[So, the current 319 is emulating the past. So... before any of us were born, the couple protected our grandparents.]<br/><br/>[Does that mean... if the couple hadn’t left with the elixir and blown up the laboratory then, perhaps none of us would exist?]<br/><br/>[How excellent of a daughter could the grandmother have raised? She was the only one in Cold Green Village to have been accepted into Truro University at the time. How could Johanes Miles have been worthy?]<br/><br/>[He’s not just unworthy; he’s also unappreciative. What was grandmother’s status? What was her status in that era? What could the Miles and Hobson families even be considered to be?]<br/><br/>[So when Sister Flynn was on that variety show, she was using Daisy Zane’s identity to acknowledge that grandma taught her a lot of knowledge.]<br/><br/>[How could a child raised by the grandmother be bad? She just didn’t go to school, but she learned just as much, if not more than what we know.]\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
