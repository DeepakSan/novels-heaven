I thought we would be sealed here for a while. Since the belongings are important, it’s right for us to cooperate with the inspection.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane showed no emotion, but there was a trace of cruelty in her eyes as she stared at the red liquid in the wine glass. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark glanced at Samuel Gray’s silly grin, and then looked at Daisy, asking, “Shall we head back as it’s getting late?” <br/><br/>“Yeah.” Daisy finished the last bit of wine in her glass, grabbed her bag, and stood up. <br/><br/>She didn’t want to cause too much trouble, but if they took the thing from her bag, she wouldn’t care anymore. <br/><br/>Samuel was a step slow and started to stand up as well, saying, “Sister, let me hold it for you.” Kevin Clark looked at the backpack, asking, “Yours?” <br/><br/>“Yeah, ” Daisy replied. <br/><br/>‘ Kevin thought the bag belonged to the man beside Daisy as he had never seen her with a bag before. He stretched out his hand to take it, “I’ll carry it.” <br/><br/>Seeing him take the bag, Samuel subconsciously gripped the other side of the backpack, glaring at Kevin, “It’s my sister’s, I’ll hold it.” <br/><br/>Kevin didn’t look at him and directly asked Daisy, “Your younger brother?” <br/><br/>“No,” she picked up the two unopened bottles of wine from the table, unzipped the backpack, put them in, and zipped it up again, “My son.” Plunge into the depths of Nøv€lß¡n, where information dwells.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark: <br/><br/>Samuel immediately looked at Daisy and called out without any burden, <br/><br/>“Daddy.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane: . <br/><br/>Kevin couldn’t help but smile, then grabbed the backpack and held it in his hand, saying, “Let’s go.” <br/><br/>Samuel glanced at his empty hands, clenched his fingers but said nothing since Daisy didn’t speak up. <br/><br/>The entire bar was under control, with only the police, the bar’s bodyguards, and Kevin’s men present. <br/><br/>An intense inspection was being conducted at the entrance. Samuel counted the number of people and assessed the security. <br/><br/>He appeared nonchalant but was prepared to act at any moment. However, Kevin simply carried the backpack, greeted the people at the entrance, and led them out. <br/><br/>Samuel blinked, not quite understanding. <br/><br/>As they walked towards the parking lot, Daisy asked, “Aren’t you going to check <br/><br/>“Losing that thing is very dangerous. This level of strict investigation is for fear of someone misusing it or it falling into the hands of criminals.” As Kevin spoke, he took off his suit jacket and draped it over Daisy’s shoulders, “It’s getting cold, wear more when you go out.” <br/><br/>He didn’t answer directly, but Daisy understood. <br/><br/>Samuel Gray had a code name, and Daisy Zane would usually call him by his real name in normal circumstances. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark smiled gently: “Alright, good night.” <br/><br/>“Behave yourself.” Daisy Zane patted James Collins’s head, and then she mercilessly opened and closed the door, leaving him outside. <br/><br/>“Got it.” James Collins replied and looked at Kevin Clark, the corner of his mouth twitching. <br/><br/>This person was clearly smiling, but why was he so scary? Wasn’t he gentle just now? Could it be his misunderstanding? <br/><br/>This person seemed a little dangerous. But with his thin arms, thin waist, and long legs, he should not be able to beat himself. <br/><br/>With that thought, James Collins felt at ease and followed Kevin Clark home. <br/><br/>After going to the bar and coming back, Daisy Zane already researched all those elixirs and stored them properly. <br/><br/>When she finally went to bed, it was already three o’clock in the morning. <br/><br/>And the next day at not even six in the morning, she was awakened by a phone call from Hill Dawson. <br/><br/>“Sister Emily, what’s wrong? Did something happen at the drama crew?” Other than something happening at the drama crew, Daisy Zane couldn’t think of any other reason for her to call so early. <br/><br/>“No, no.” Hill Dawson’s voice sounded quite happy, “Lucia, did you act in a movie a few months ago?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane snuggled back into her quilt, her voice muffled, “Mm.” <br/><br/>“The movie had a premiere last night.” Hill Dawson said, “You’re a sensation! <br/><br/>Hahahaha...” <br/><br/>As soon as she laughed, Daisy Zane sobered up quite a bit. In that movie, she only appeared in one scene, but she also roughly looked at the script. <br/><br/>It was a suspenseful theme. <br/><br/>It left a lingering suspense in the end. <br/><br/>And she was that final suspense, only one scene, where she smiled at the lens. <br/><br/>A pretty ordinary smile, but it left infinite room for imagination. <br/><br/>“Lucia, you just had that one scene, but it was so amazing.” Hill Dawson said, “The movie itself is popular, well-produced, and has a great script. Your appearance at the end was like a mini-climax. Now everyone online is praising you, asking who this stunning lady is. You’re currently 18th on the Hot <br/><br/>Searches.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane responded casually. <br/><br/>Hill Dawson: “This is a great opportunity. We must take advantage of the hype for marketing. Lucia, do you have a Facebook?” <br/><br/>“No.” Daisy Zane replied, “Help me register one, and you can manage it for me afterward. <br/><br/>“Alright, you just wait, I’ll definitely make the most of this trend.” <br/><br/>“Mm..”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
