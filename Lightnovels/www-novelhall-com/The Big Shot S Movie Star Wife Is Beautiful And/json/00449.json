And she would definitely not tell outsiders about the top floor of the Doomsday Hotel. <br/><br/>This woman knew quite a few things, and what was her purpose? <br/><br/>“May I know, who are you...?” <br/><br/>After William Lane left, he received the surveillance video from the security room. <br/><br/>Curious to know who it was, Olivia Lane took a look at the surveillance video. <br/><br/>She almost had a heart attack when she saw that the person in the video was Daisy Zane. <br/><br/>Why did she go there! <br/><br/>Olivia Lane’s brain worked quickly, and she roughly figured out the situation based on the phone call Daisy Zane had made to her earlier. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane must have thought she was in danger and went to the rooftop to protect her. <br/><br/>Olivia Lane didn’t think about why she was in danger, or how Daisy Zane knew she was in danger. <br/><br/>The key now was that her brother had gone up too. <br/><br/>If they bumped into each other... things would become very difficult. <br/><br/>She hurried towards the elevator, calling Kevin Clark while walking. <br/><br/>Although the top floor had only Charlotte Lane’s and Olivia Lane’s rooms, the area was extensive. <br/><br/>Both girls had large rooms. <br/><br/>When Daisy Zane received Olivia Lane’s call, she had already walked half the distance inside. <br/><br/>Since Olivia Lane was safe, Daisy Zane did not intend to stay any longer. <br/><br/>This whole situation was suspicious from the start, and she came up here just to ensure Olivia Lane’s safety. <br/><br/>However, she couldn’t quite understand why – if Mrs. Davis let her overhear it on purpose, what was the reason for bringing her here? <br/><br/>This place belonged to the Lane family, and others couldn’t come up. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane had essentially hacked the elevator’s sensor with her cell phone to get up there.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
