A show by Flynn Ninevara!<br/><br/>“I, we, us?”<br/><br/>“Yes, there might not be many parts.” Daisy Zane said, “But the characters are very important.”<br/><br/>Yesterday, when the three of them were gossiping, Daisy Zane instantly arranged roles for them in her mind. Although there might not be many parts.<br/><br/>But it could serve as the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>Actually, it would be fine to let others play the roles.<br/><br/>But after all there are prototypes. Using prototypes is the best. So Daisy Zane left the words “see you later” yesterday.<br/><br/>It’s just they are top celebrities, and they should be very busy. She doesn’t know if they have time.<br/><br/>“Yes, yes.” Another boy responded.<br/><br/>“Right, right, yes.”<br/><br/>“No need to find my agent, I can accept. Brook God, I’m always available,” said another boy, “Whenever you need me, I can be there.”<br/><br/>“Mhmm,” Daisy Zane said, “I’ll contact your agents in advance.”<br/><br/>The three men were suddenly so excited that after standing beside Daisy Zane for a while, they gradually reacted: “Brook God, let me toast you.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane took a step forward, but was pulled back by the woman.<br/><br/>She turned around and realized it was an acquaintance.<br/><br/>Amelia Miles and Mrs. Davis of the Johnson Family in Truro City.<br/><br/>It was Mrs. Davis who had just stopped Daisy Zane. Daisy Zane let go of her, and Mrs. Davis almost fell but was supported by Amelia Miles.<br/><br/>“What no manners, don’t you know how to apologize when you bump into someone?” Mrs. Davis glared at her.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at the two of them without speaking, but her expression was very bad.<br/><br/>Seeing Daisy Zane’s pale face, Amelia Miles whispered, “Sister, what’s wrong?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane gave them a gloomy look and turned to leave.<br/><br/>The two were intimated by her look, but once she turned around, they immediately reacted.<br/><br/>Last time at the Cloud Clothes and Rainbow Skirts Show, Mrs. Davis was “asked” to leave. She had always been holding a grudge, and now that she saw the person, how could she let it go?<br/><br/>“You uncultured wild child, stand still. Can’t you hear people talking to you!” Mrs. Davis chased after her again.<br/><br/>“Auntie ” Amelia Miles followed.<br/><br/>Mrs. Davis grabbed Daisy Zane’s arm, and Daisy Zane grabbed her arm back in response, turning around and glaring coldly at her: “Don’t look for death!”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s hand tightened, and Mrs. Davis cried out in pain, “Let go of me!”<br/><br/>“Sister, calm down. What happened?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane was already trying to restrain the violent factor inside her body and did not directly hit anyone.<br/><br/>“Daisy Zane, you crazy woman! Let go of me!”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s hand tightened, throwing Mrs. Davis away again: “Since you know I’m crazy, next time you see me, take a detour.”<br/><br/>Mrs. Davis hit the wall directly, and her back hurt so much, she couldn’t speak for a moment.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at Amelia Miles again: “Don’t call me sister, it makes me sick.”<br/><br/>Amelia Miles’ face changed instantly, and she clenched her teeth to maintain her image.<br/><br/>There were so many surveillance cameras here, and those eating here were either rich or powerful. Someone could come out at any time, and she couldn’t lose her composure.<br/><br/>“Sister, don’t say that,” Amelia Miles whispered.<br/><br/>“Amelia, do you expect a crude, uneducated person like Daisy Zane to say anything nice?” Mrs. Davis straightened her shawl and lifted her chin. Looking at Daisy Zane, she said, “No manners, crude, ignorant, and foul-mouthed. You, not to mention marrying into our Davis Family, you are not even someone our Davis Family would like to glance at.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
