Only her beautiful and gorgeous phoenix eyes were exposed, looking at the fat man curled up on the ground and unable to get up as he clutched his abdomen. <br/><br/>\"Who are you, exactly? What...do you want?\" The fat man had a fierce expression and a scar above his left eyebrow. His well-dressed appearance couldn't conceal the violent aura surrounding him. But he had been beaten, and it took him a while to finally speak. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn't speak, she took out a small sealed bag from her pocket and threw it in front of the fat man. <br/><br/>The fat man gasped for breath, propped himself up, and picked up the sealed bag from the ground. Inside were two empty sealing bottles, their caps already open. <br/><br/>Turning the bag around, the man's pupils trembled when he saw the numbers on the sealing bottle. <br/><br/>The labels on the sealing bottles were simple, only three blue bold numbers: 319. There was nothing else. <br/><br/>Seeing that the man didn't speak, Daisy asked, \"These things came from your hands. Where did they come from?\" <br/><br/>\"I don't know what you're talking about. I don't recognize these things either,\" the fat man denied as he threw the items back on the floor. Trace back the roots of this material to n0v$lbin<br/><br/>\"I found you, which means you've been exposed. Do you think that at this point, still hiding things, your people above will let you off?\" Daisy Zane's voice was calm and cold, reminiscent of falling snow, yet the oppressive feeling was palpable. \"Doing your line of work, you should know better than to let someone slip through your fingers, right?\" <br/><br/>The fat man kept his head down and didn't speak. <br/><br/>\"Are you going to speak?\" <br/><br/>Daisy Zane waited for a moment, and when she saw his hesitation, she got up, \"I suddenly feel like exposing your whereabouts and waiting patiently for the catch might work.\" <br/><br/>After saying that, she started walking away. <br/><br/>\"Wait a minute! Wait a minute!\" <br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn't stop. <br/><br/>\"I'll talk! I'll talk! As long as you ensure my safety, I'll tell you everything!\" <br/><br/>Standing in front of the elevator, Daisy Zane replied to the message. She was about to press the elevator button when the elevator door opened on that floor. <br/><br/>The elevator doors slowly opened, and Daisy Zane looked up to see an exceptionally beautiful face. <br/><br/>The man's features were delicate, seductive, and aggressive. <br/><br/>His slender eyes, with narrow double eyelids that were nonetheless deep, were enchanting. <br/><br/>Especially his lips, as red as dan sand, were naturally extraordinary. <br/><br/>He resembled an ancient painting, meticulously crafted with each stroke. <br/><br/>After two or three seconds of eye contact, Daisy Zane raised her eyebrows, her demeanor somewhat flamboyant. <br/><br/>The man in the elevator also gave her a gentle, intoxicating smile. <br/><br/>Neither of them spoke, and Daisy Zane stepped aside to let the two men out of the elevator before walking in herself. <br/><br/>The elevator doors slowly closed, descending, only then did the man divert his gaze, walking inside. <br/><br/>The man who had been following him all along hesitated for a moment and immediately caught up to him, \"Arthur North, you just smiled. Do you fancy that lady?\" <br/><br/>\"Don't I usually smile?\" Kevin Clark's voice was very pleasant, low, and uniquely melodious. <br/><br/>\"When have you ever smiled at someone with such tenderness?\" Allonzo Hobson said, incredulously, as he leaned against the side of the elevator, scrutinizing Kevin's smile. \"And she's a stranger...Third Master, when did you become so compassionate?\" <br/><br/>\"Just now, I guess.\" <br/><br/>\"...\" <br/><br/>Kevin Clark stopped in front of Room 3603, looking at Allonzo Hobson. <br/><br/>Getting the hint, Allonzo Hobson took out his room card and swiped open the door. <br/><br/>... <br/><br/>Daisy Zane went to the floor where the banquet hall was located and sent a message to Robinson Scott, asking him to come out to meet her; she didn't go inside herself. <br/><br/>Today's engagement banquet was between Amelia Miles, the Miles Family heiress, and John Anderson of the Anning Faction. <br/><br/>And she... was the Miles Family's illegitimate daughter.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
