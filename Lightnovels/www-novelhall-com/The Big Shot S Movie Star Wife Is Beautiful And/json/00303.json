Fortunately, the arms inspections in Imperial Capital have always been strict, and various channels have been scrutinizing both openly and secretly. <br/><br/>Especially for outsiders like them, with over a hundred people, the number of guns they could carry would not exceed five. <br/><br/>Moreover, once they fired, it would easily attract attention, so they would not shoot easily. <br/><br/>“Are you still angry?” Daisy asked. <br/><br/>“Can I just ask directly?” Kevin retorted. <br/><br/>“Otherwise?” <br/><br/>Kevin chuckled, “If I said I was still angry, what would you do?” <br/><br/>“Wait for you to calm down on your own.” <br/><br/>Kevin: <br/><br/>Daisy looked at him calmly, speechless. <br/><br/>After a while, Kevin pinched her cheek and said, “Seeing you having a car accident and being injured made me feel both heartache and fear. If I didn’t care about you, I’d really want to hit you twice. Why are you so disobedient?” <br/><br/>Daisy raised her eyebrows. <br/><br/>Although Kevin was smiling and his tone sounded normal and gentle, she could feel that he wasn’t completely over the anger. <br/><br/>Or perhaps, he was really scared. <br/><br/>The incident hadn’t completely sunk in for Kevin yet. <br/><br/>But he was afraid of upsetting her, so he deliberately suppressed it. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark laughed: “Be careful with your hand.” <br/><br/>“Mmm.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark sent a message on his cell phone, asking someone to prepare lunch and buy clothes. He sent the clothing sizes and then started the car. <br/><br/>Just as they pulled out of the parking space, Daisy Zane said, “How about I drive?” <br/><br/>“Hmm?” <br/><br/>“I’m afraid you’ll get tired.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark rubbed her head with his hand, “Be good and don’t be mischievous.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised the corner of her mouth and subtly twisted her right wrist. <br/><br/>She almost thought her hands would be crippled today... <br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s place is close to the First Courtyard, a European villa with a large area. It didn’t seem like he visited often. <br/><br/>When they arrived, someone was cooking in the kitchen, and the person who went to the nearest shopping mall to buy clothes hadn’t returned yet. <br/><br/>So after Daisy Zane took a bath, she put on Kevin Clark’s clothes first. <br/><br/>To make bathing easier, she removed all the bandages and pain relief patches. <br/><br/>“Why did you take them off?” After his shower, Kevin Clark changed his clothes, and his hair was still dripping water. <br/><br/>“How else am I supposed to bathe?” Daisy Zane buttoned the last button on her shirt with one hand, “I’ll put them back on.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark fetched a towel from the restroom and wiped her hair. After her hair was half-dry, he carefully applied medicine, put on the pain relief patches, and bandages. <br/><br/>After finishing, Daisy Zane praised, “Not bad, better than the doctor.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark laughed and reminded her, “Remember to apply medicine when you go back to school. Be careful with everything. If it hurts, call me, and I’ll come to pick you up.” <br/><br/>“Mmm.” <br/><br/>“Let’s go eat.” <br/><br/>The two went downstairs, and Daisy Zane wore Kevin Clark’s clothes. She rolled up her pant legs and sleeves to her elbows. <br/><br/>The clothes and pants were loose on her, concealing her original figure. <br/><br/>Looking from behind, if one ignored her long hair, they might believe she was a boy. <br/><br/>For a moment, Kevin Clark thought her silhouette looked familiar. <br/><br/>But before he could think further, Daisy Zane sat down at the dining table, and her gaze toward him interrupted his thoughts. <br/><br/>The two sat down, and as the servant served food, they glanced at Daisy Zane several times. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn’t mind and ate her meal slowly. After a while, she said, “I suspect someone at the school is monitoring Lucia.” <br/><br/>She had always found it strange why the little girl, after jumping out of such a... remote place, was caught so quickly. <br/><br/>“I’ve had someone looking into it,” Kevin Clark said. “The people from the Lane family following Lucia have been intercepted halfway.” <br/><br/>No wonder she had been waiting for the Lane family, they might have been under surveillance too.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
