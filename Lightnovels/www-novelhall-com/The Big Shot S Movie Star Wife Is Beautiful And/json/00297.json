Her hand hanging by her side kept touching the test papers in her pocket.<br/><br/>Two minutes later, a business car with a sudden brake stopped in front of her.<br/><br/>Olivia Lane frowned and subconsciously stepped back two steps defensively.<br/><br/>Then another business car stopped behind it.<br/><br/>The doors of both cars opened, and ten men in black came out.<br/><br/>Olivia Lane put her hand in her pants pocket and looked at them: “What are you doing?”<br/><br/>The man leading the group had a scar near the end of his left eyebrow. He smiled and said, “Miss Lane, please come with us.”<br/><br/>“Where?” Olivia Lane unlocked her phone in her pocket, swiped the screen to the front, and after swiping several times and making sure it was on the main screen, she roughly pressed the call icon position.<br/><br/>She randomly dialed a number.<br/><br/>“We will ensure Miss Lane’s safety,” the man said.<br/><br/>Facing these ten people, Olivia Lane was very clear that she couldn’t win, but her voice showed no fear, only a cold fierceness: “I can go with you, but I need to know who sent you.”<br/><br/>She timed her words well, speaking the moment the call connected, masking the faint sound coming from the phone.<br/><br/>“The Clark Family.”<br/><br/>Olivia Lane narrowed her eyes, quickly realizing that it must be Henry Clark.<br/><br/>Henry must be trying to use her to threaten the Lane Family and stir up trouble, making the Lane and Clark families into enemies. Henry would seize the opportunity to take over the Clark Family.<br/><br/>“Henry Clark sent you?” Olivia Lane casually reported her location, “He put in some effort, even finding me behind the school’s waste disposal.”<br/><br/>“As long as the Lane Family cooperates, we will not harm a single hair on Miss Lane’s head.”<br/><br/>Olivia Lane sneered inwardly. Guarantee her safety...<br/><br/>She immediately asked a nearby cleaning aunt about the location of the garbage pit and rushed in that direction.<br/><br/>Fight sounds gradually came through her earpiece, and the coldness and killing intent in Daisy’s eyes grew heavier.<br/><br/>At the same time, Holt’s voice came through the other phone: “The phone has a barrier. Locating will take time.”<br/><br/>Daisy replied as she ran, “Check all the surveillance near the school, especially the west side near Forest Park. A nineteen-year-old girl, beautiful, wearing a school uniform.”<br/><br/>“Understood.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane rushed to the area at her fastest speed, but the school was too large. When she was still nearly a hundred meters from the garbage pit, Olivia Lane cursed twice in her ear, and the call was cut off.<br/><br/>At the same time, Holt had received news.<br/><br/>“The security camera on the west side of the school shows two business cars had just taken away a girl wearing school uniform pants. I’ll send it to your phone.”<br/><br/>“Send to my phone.” Daisy Zane, gasping for breath, quickly thought for a moment and started running towards the school entrance where the drama crew was. There were cars there, and it was the shortest distance for her to chase from the school. “Keep an eye on those two cars at all costs. I’ll take responsibility if anything goes wrong. Send out all the people you can spare to track them down.”<br/><br/>“Yes, sir,” Holt Lawrence responded.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane glanced at the video sent by Holt and confirmed it was Olivia Lane.<br/><br/>She had been dragged into the car, but it was unclear if she had been hurt.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane quickly went to the school entrance but saw Felix Baker’s driver before she saw the program crew members.<br/><br/>To be precise, she first saw Felix Baker’s pure black Bugatti.<br/><br/>It was too noticeable parked in the school.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane walked straight for the car. She knew Felix Baker rarely drove himself and would usually bring a driver, even for a sports car.<br/><br/>When Daisy Zane saw the driver, she said directly, “Give me the car key, I need to borrow the car. I’ve already talked to Felix Baker.”<br/><br/>The driver had been with Felix Baker for many years and naturally recognized Daisy Zane. He also knew how close Felix Baker and Daisy Zane were.<br/><br/>And it was the first time he had seen her so anxious, cold, and ruthless, with a terrifying aura.<br/><br/>Frightened by her, the driver subconsciously handed her the car key.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane got into the driver’s seat and buckled her seat belt. As she drove out of the parking space, she called Harton Clark and told him Olivia Lane had been taken away.<br/><br/>After hanging up, she had already driven the car out of the school.<br/><br/>George Dunn’s phone was still on the call with Holt Lawrence, never hung up. Daisy Zane asked while driving, “Tell me the location.”<br/><br/>After saying that, she held the steering wheel with one hand, shifted gears with the other, and stepped on the gas pedal to speed off.<br/><br/>People at the entrance stared at the Bugatti that suddenly shot out: “!!!???!!!”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
