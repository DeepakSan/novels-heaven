Celestial Pivot, Celestial Pivot’s defense system has been breached! Did you hear the alarm?! Damn it! Fuck! What’s going on today?! Everything’s happening at once! Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up What do we do? The hacker world is going to change! Ahhhh What do we do?”<br/><br/>Holt Lawrence was busy protecting Celestial Pivot from being invaded while yelling.<br/><br/>Many people could attack the Celestial Pivot defense system, even if they couldn’t break through. However, Celestial Pivot still had a set of targeted defense mechanisms.<br/><br/>“Who do you think can break it?” Daisy Zane asked calmly.<br/><br/>“I don’t know! How should I know which corner suddenly sprung up an ancestor? I ” Holt Lawrence suddenly stopped speaking, and the sound of typing on the keyboard disappeared. “You did it?”<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>The smile in Kevin Clark’s eyes gradually faded.<br/><br/>Juan Wright held his breath, and his face turned red little by little.<br/><br/>Hugo Clark’s face changed dramatically.<br/><br/>Bonnie Maxwell froze in place, unable to move.<br/><br/>“What the hell are you doing?! Damn it! My f My heart’s about to crack!” Holt Lawrence suddenly let out a sigh of relief. “Ancestor, why would you attack your own defense system for no reason? Everyone in the building is going to be scared to death. Can you give a heads up before you start next time?”<br/><br/>“I did it on purpose.”<br/><br/>“You!” Holt Lawrence yelled angrily, then his tone softened again. “Nana, has it been restored?”<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane was the creator of the system; she knew best how to manipulate it. For security reasons, she did not traditionally break through. She just made the alarms in the building go off.<br/><br/>After hearing her answer, Holt Lawrence’s tone hardened again: “Hmph! You’ve lost me now!”<br/><br/>Bonnie Maxwell was speechless. She felt the blood in her body flowing backward, and she had to take deep breaths to get some air into her lungs.<br/><br/>“You also want to go against Charles Amos,” Daisy Zane’s expression in her eyes became colder inch by inch. “Celebrity actress gives birth to a child underage.”<br/><br/>Charles Amos blinked her big eyes.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark did not know about this matter and frowned slightly when he heard it.<br/><br/>The faces of the Clark Family members all looked ugly.<br/><br/>“You, stop talking nonsense,” Bonnie Maxwell defended. “What evidence do you have that I am against Charles Amos?”<br/><br/>“The messages intercepted by Celestial Pivot. You ask me what evidence I have?” Daisy Zane’s voice grew harsher. “If you want to deny it, then don’t do it. You think that by joining Celestial Pivot, I can’t do anything to you? You’re so naive. The entire Celestial Pivot is at my disposal, what do you have to be proud of?”<br/><br/>As always Daisy Zane would pick the most sensitive points to provoke people.<br/><br/>Bonnie Maxwell took pride in being a member of Celestial Pivot, so Daisy used her identity as Nathan Ninevara to crush her proud backbone.<br/><br/>Bonnie Maxwell’s chest heaved violently, and everything else in her vision besides Daisy Zane seemed to have all become void.<br/><br/>She was Nathan Ninevara, so any traces she left online would be found out.<br/><br/>Denial would be harder than ascending to heaven.<br/><br/>Since the face had been torn off<br/><br/>“Yes, that’s right. I helped cover up the messages online. I was also involved in sending out the video,” Bonnie Maxwell’s face twisted with anger. “And the thing about Charles Amos, I did that too. So what? I admit it! What can you do to me!”<br/><br/>Bonnie Maxwell believed firmly that the Clark Family would certainly consider her family and not do anything to her.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at her, and after a moment, she chuckled.<br/><br/>This chuckle seemed to seal their fates.<br/><br/>“I had people surround this place,” Daisy Zane said. “Without my order, no one can leave. Maxwell Family, Clark Family No one can protect you today.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
