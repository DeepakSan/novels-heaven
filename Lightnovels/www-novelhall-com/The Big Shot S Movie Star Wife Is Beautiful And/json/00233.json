Even if he could see her, he could only catch a glimpse of her profile. <br/><br/>The seating of Harton Clark and Daisy Zane was also quite coincidental. <br/><br/>It was just far enough from where Tom Wayne and his group were sitting that the two groups couldn’t see each other. <br/><br/>It was, however, easy to look up and see Amelia Miles on the opposite side of the catwalk. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn’t pay much attention to Amelia Miles, after glancing at her once, she never noticed her again. <br/><br/>But Amelia Miles’ attention had always been on Daisy Zane and the exceptionally handsome man sitting next to her with an air of nobility and a strong aura. <br/><br/>Hill Dawson sat next to Daisy Zane, while Anisa Cooper sat behind her. Anisa said indignantly when she saw Amelia keep looking in their direction, “Why does she keep staring? Can I charge her money if she keeps looking?” <br/><br/>“Why bother looking at her when there are so many beautiful clothes to look at?” Hill Dawson said. <br/><br/>“Good point.” Anisa watched the show for a while and said, “The color palette for this year’s clothes is quite cold.” <br/><br/>“It’s for the winter season. The colors are chosen according to the seasons. This is the traditional winter keynote color.” Daisy Zane explained while watching, “This year’s main theme is to cater to the cold tones of winter. This is a traditional color, bronze blue. Color of the beginning of ice.” <br/><br/>Harton Clark looked at her from the corner of his eyes. Although her voice was cold and emotionless, he sensed her strong interest in the clothes. <br/><br/>Moreover... she was very knowledgeable. <br/><br/>“Apart from the main color, bronze blue, this outfit has a longer layer beneath the cuffs and the skirt hem in stone green, which is a traditional color and also a winter keynote color, the color of the ice joining.” Daisy Zane explained quietly. “This is the color of ice.” <br/><br/>“Daisy, how do you know all this so clearly?” Anisa looked at her in admiration. <br/><br/>Although the official website stated that the main color for this winter was the <br/><br/>traditional bronze blue, it did not introduce the other matching colors. <br/><br/>For someone like Anisa, she would only say that the cuffs are in a dark green color and would not be able to specifically say the color is stone green. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane gave her a “go ahead and adore your Daisy” look before continuing to watch the show. <br/><br/>However, Hill Dawson felt that something about the situation seemed off. <br/><br/>The clothing styles of Cloud Clothes and Rainbow Skirts covered a wide range. <br/><br/>There were trendy styles, vintage styles, Western styles, Chinese styles, a mix of Chinese and Western, a mix of ancient and modern, and so on. <br/><br/>Moreover, not only were the main colors different every year, but the styles would also change significantly. <br/><br/>“Ah! Daisy, this dress is so beautiful.” Anisa Cooper covered her mouth in awe and said, “Does Shopie have no design bottleneck? Why are her designs always stunning every year?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane said nothing. She had not yet encountered a bottleneck in her fashion design. <br/><br/>Only when facing people like Felix Baker, who constantly pressed her for drafts, would she experience a creative bottleneck. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark looked at her and could feel her good mood since they arrived at the showground. <br/><br/>It seemed that his little girl just hated shopping, but she still loved to see beautiful clothes. <br/><br/>As he thought this, the cell phone in his pocket suddenly made two noises. <br/><br/>Judging by the sound, it was Daisy Zane’s phone. Just after coming out of the restroom, Daisy had given her phone to Kevin to hold onto. <br/><br/>Daisy also heard the sound and looked sideways at him. <br/><br/>Kevin took out the phone, held it in his hand, and said to her, “Call me elder brother, and I’ll give you the phone.” <br/><br/>Anisa Cooper was already leaning close to Daisy Zane, almost resting on her back. But after hearing Kevin’s voice, she laughed once and immediately moved back a little. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised her phoenix eyes to look at him, showing a hint of chill in her beautiful eyes. <br/><br/>Kevin smiled as he looked at her, genuinely waiting for her to call him “elder brother.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at him for two more seconds, then suddenly closed her eyes, furrowed her brows, and reached up to cover her right eye. <br/><br/>Kevin’s smile vanished instantly, and he asked with concern, “What’s wrong? Is your eye uncomfortable?” <br/><br/>“What’s going on? Did something get in her eye?” asked Hill Dawson. <br/><br/>“Daisy, what’s wrong?” Anisa Cooper asked nervously. <br/><br/>As a result, Daisy Zane, with her eyes closed, sensed the position of her cell phone and directly took it from Kevin’s hand. <br/><br/>She grabbed the phone, opened her eyes, and sat down properly. The whole movement was smooth and fast. <br/><br/>While the others were still stunned, Daisy Zane had already acted as if nothing had happened and opened her phone to check the messages inside. <br/><br/>Hill Dawson: <br/><br/>Kevin looked at his empty hand, hesitated for a moment. <br/><br/>Then he looked at her, grinded his teeth, and with a hint of ferocity in his tone but gentleness in his eyes, he said, “Naughty girl, you tricked me.” “Hmm, what’s wrong?” Daisy Zane raised her head to look at him. <br/><br/>“I...” Kevin squeezed her fingers a little tighter, then said in a deflated tone, “Nothing. ” <br/><br/>What could he do? He had to spoil his little girl. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane heard his satisfactory answer, lowered her head to look at her phone, and replied to a message. <br/><br/>Anisa Cooper looked at Kevin, who seemed to have no choice but to spoil her, and lowered her head to laugh. <br/><br/>But after laughing for only two seconds, she was stared at by Kevin. Her heart trembled, and she immediately dared not laugh anymore. She even moved closer to Hill Dawson to hide.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
