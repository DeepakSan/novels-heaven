However, he felt that the surroundings were too dark, encroaching on him bit by bit.<br/><br/>“Brother Arthur, you’re really hard to deceive,” Charlotte Lane looked at the increasingly red corners of his eyes and complained, “It’s so hard to hide something from you. I need to be highly focused every day, fearing that a single mistake would arouse suspicion. You taught me, you know me too well. But ... it’s because of that, I know you too.”<br/><br/>“So...” Charlotte Lane stood up, leaned down, and touched Kevin Clark’s eyebrows, “I’m very clear that as long as I control you, no one can stop me.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark couldn’t speak; he could only look at her with pleading eyes, trying to hold her back.<br/><br/>“Moreover... I only trust you,” Charlotte Lane said slowly, “I only feel at ease when you’re on the outside. And only you can really deal with Edward Kirsten. I trust you so much, you should trust me too.”<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane glanced at Kevin Clark for a while, then stood up straight and put her cell phone next to him, “There’s a recording in it. The Hundred Demons Pavilion, the Celestial Pivot, and the Darknight Alliance will listen to your instructions. I’ll leave everything here for you, Brother Arthur.”<br/><br/>A few days would be enough for her to arrange everything.<br/><br/>Moreover, the “inside and out” step was one she had been planning for a long time.<br/><br/>Last time she went to the Mountain Sea Continent, she had a long conversation with Luke, preparing for this step.<br/><br/>But when Kevin Clark thwarted so many of Edward Kirsten’s lairs and chased him everywhere, she considered giving up on the idea.<br/><br/>However, when she found out that Edward Kirsten had framed her, she made up her mind again, using his own scheme against him and deciding to deal with it personally.<br/><br/>Many things started because of her; she should also end them personally.<br/><br/>Quite a few people from the Hundred Demons Pavilion had come to the country.<br/><br/>They all sneaked in in disguise, and they didn’t enter the Imperial Capital.<br/><br/>Only James Collins’s men entered the capital, which was deliberately arranged to hide the truth from Kevin Clark.<br/><br/>After explaining everything, Charlotte Lane touched the ring on her hand and prepared to leave.<br/><br/>But just as she took a step forward, her wrist was grabbed.<br/><br/>With all his strength, Kevin Clark raised his hand and grabbed her wrist.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane looked at him in surprise.<br/><br/>Due to his urgency and effort, Kevin Clark’s chest heaved as he said with difficulty, “Charlotte, don’t go!”<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane gripped his hand and easily held his hand, removing it from her wrist and placing it back on his leg.<br/><br/>She stood beside him for a while, then leaned down and gently kissed his eyes.<br/><br/>As her lips touched Kevin Clark’s eyelids, Charlotte Lane’s tears fell onto Kevin Clark’s face.<br/><br/>And when Kevin Clark closed his eyes, tears also fell from the corners of his eyes.<br/><br/>Two drops of tears slowly disappeared into his hair along his face.<br/><br/>The bedroom door opened and closed, and everything returned to calm.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark opened his eyes, his eyes were bloodshot, and he was full of exhaustion.<br/><br/>He tried to exert his strength continuously, but due to the powerful effect of the medicine, he couldn’t muster any strength.<br/><br/>A skirmish soon started outside.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane sat quietly inside the car, staring at the pitch-dark night outside.<br/><br/>The night was so black, as if the dark ink of the night was gradually enveloping everyone.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane was brought down from the police car and then pushed onto another car.<br/><br/>Once she got up on the car, her eyes were blindfolded.<br/><br/>She had to rely on her senses to figure out the direction.<br/><br/>Less than an hour later, there was a fight at the border of Imperial Capital.<br/><br/>She was put into another car, and this one drove even faster than before. And it was constantly winding and circling. Both the driver and the other person inside the car were foreigners.<br/><br/>From their conversation, they were trying to shake off the cars chasing them.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>In the Rose Garden, Arthur North continuously struggled with his own body.<br/><br/>Thomas Firway lay unconscious on the ground, not moving at all.<br/><br/>Finally, Arthur reached Charlotte Lane’s cell phone. It took him about ten minutes to unlock the six-digit password by pressing on the screen.<br/><br/>His back was drenched in sweat.<br/><br/>Once unlocked, he slowly moved his fingers to find William Lane’s contact information.<br/><br/>When he finally managed to dial the number, he couldn’t speak.<br/><br/>“Charlotte? What’s wrong? Is there anything wrong?” William Lane asked anxiously from the other end, thinking something had happened.<br/><br/>“It’s me.” At last, Arthur North managed to speak.<br/><br/>His head was soaked in sweat, his eyelashes wet from it.<br/><br/>“What’s going on with your voice? Where are you?”<br/><br/>Gasping for breath, Arthur stuttered, “Imperial Capital, border, notify people, stop Charlotte.”<br/><br/>It was difficult for him to utter the sentence, his voice intermittent and somewhat unclear, but William Lane understood after a brief pause.<br/><br/>He quickly contacted his people.<br/><br/>He also headed there immediately.<br/><br/>But he was still one step too late.<br/><br/>When he contacted his people, the fight had just begun there.<br/><br/>However, Julian Maxwell’s men opened a passage at the border, and the Hundred Demons Pavilion and the Darknight Alliance got involved, seemingly helping but actually causing more harm.<br/><br/>After they took Charlotte Lane out, the people from Clark Family, Lane Family, and Dark Radiance went to chase her. The Hundred Demons Pavilion and the Darknight Alliance pretended to chase as well.<br/><br/>As a result, they disrupted everything completely...\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
