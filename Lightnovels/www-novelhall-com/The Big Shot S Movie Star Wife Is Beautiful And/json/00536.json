Today, her repertoire ended a bit earlier, but she didn’t leave.<br/><br/>As usual, she waited for Sophie’s rehearsal to finish.<br/><br/>She had just gone to the restroom, and when she came back, she heard a sound coming from the practice room and curiously went to take a look.<br/><br/>When there were no performances scheduled, all the practice rooms on this floor would be full, but once a performance was arranged, everyone would gather in Sophie’s practice room.<br/><br/>So at this point in time, she was somewhat curious about the sound in the practice room.<br/><br/>The door to the practice room was not fully closed, leaving a small gap. From the entrance, she could see Charlotte Lane at a glance.<br/><br/>When Stella saw the person inside, she was momentarily stunned before she became rooted to the spot.<br/><br/>She watched Charlotte’s fingers, arms, neck, waist, and legs. She observed every technique and every movement.<br/><br/>From a professional standpoint, she could give a very good evaluation.<br/><br/>Even these techniques were better than some people in the Dance Association.<br/><br/>Sophie’s dance represented the highest level of classical dance.<br/><br/>Her daughter, even if she merely inherited a little of her genes, would naturally be quite good as well.<br/><br/>However, compared to those who could perform, there was still a gap.<br/><br/>And the difference was more or less about systematic and repetitive practice.<br/><br/>But what about it?<br/><br/>Stella watched her and thought that in the eyes of a loved one, there would be no professional standards. You were always the best, no matter how you performed.<br/><br/>This was something others couldn’t achieve, no matter how hard they tried.<br/><br/>Like in Edward Kirsten’s eyes, no matter how hard she tried and how well she danced, she would never be as good as the Enigma Starry in his heart.<br/><br/>Stella felt a gradually increasing ache in her chest with each breath and involuntarily clenched her fingers hanging by her side.<br/><br/>Inside the practice room, Charlotte took another stepping turn...<br/><br/>She turned without a problem, but her bun couldn’t withstand it, so it unraveled.<br/><br/>That’s why she stopped as well.<br/><br/>Then Hanton Clark’s applause immediately rang out.<br/><br/>Charlotte was catching her breath a little, and while taking apart her fallen bun, she looked at Harton and said, “Such a lavish applause.”<br/><br/>Harton approached and helped her with her hair, “It’s because Madam danced well.”<br/><br/>Her hair was entangled with the hair tie, making it difficult to fix. Charlotte simply turned around, letting Harton fix it for her.<br/><br/>Harton carefully helped her with her hair, speaking in a gentle voice, “With some practice, you can perform with Aunt Sophie.”<br/><br/>Stella Edwards exchanged a few words with them before leaving first.<br/><br/>Although she hid it well, Charlotte still sensed her awkward attitude.<br/><br/>Ever since the inexplicably hostile incident last time, this time she had a hard time talking to her.<br/><br/>Charlotte didn’t know where her hostility and awkwardness came from.<br/><br/>The two had no conflicts of interest. Moreover, according to Morris, Stella Edwards seemed to quite like her.<br/><br/>So where was the problem?<br/><br/>As she thought, Charlotte looked toward Kevin Clark.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark was chatting with Sophie Ortiz. When he saw her looking over, her eyes looked cold and probing.<br/><br/>“What’s... the matter?” Kevin Clark asked cautiously.<br/><br/>Sophie Ortiz also looked over.<br/><br/>Charlotte looked at Kevin Clark for a while, then took back her gaze: “Nothing.”<br/><br/>Was it really nothing?<br/><br/>Kevin Clark thought so, but just now that gaze, he seemed to see a washing board waving at him in the supermarket.<br/><br/>But looking again, the little girl was calm and indifferent as if the person just now wasn’t her.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>This trip to the Mountain Sea Continent was Charlotte Lane’s first long journey after returning to the Lane family.<br/><br/>The evening before leaving, Sophie Ortiz and Aunt Cruz packed three large suitcases filled with clothes, food, and essentials for Charlotte Lane.<br/><br/>While the two of them were packing, Old Master Lane and Andrew Lane kept reminding her to take care of her health and be safe.<br/><br/>Olivia Lane was even nagged to sleep.<br/><br/>But Charlotte listened to them.<br/><br/>“Charlotte, this suitcase is full of clothes. These two mainly contain food.” Sophie Ortiz said, “Many of them were made by Aunt Cruz herself, share them with your friends.”<br/><br/>Charlotte raised her eyebrows: “Mom, let me give you a heads-up.”<br/><br/>“What?” Sophie Ortiz looked at her and asked.<br/><br/>“If I really give these to them.” Charlotte said, “Our home might always have visitors and be lively.”<br/><br/>“That’s good, I like lively.” Sophie Ortiz said.<br/><br/>“Yeah, not bad.” Andrew Lane agreed, “Our house is big enough to accommodate many people.”<br/><br/>Charlotte smiled but didn’t respond.<br/><br/>In her heart, she thought: I hope you’ll be just as happy when the time comes.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
