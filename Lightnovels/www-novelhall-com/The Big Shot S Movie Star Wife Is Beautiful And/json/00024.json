Fairy Clan! <br/><br/>Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios <br/><br/>“Third Master, we have found the force responsible for the goods robbery at Truro Pier.” Michael Jackson reported in the study room. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark stood in front of the desk, holding a brush, writing. The scent of books and elegant writing were full of strength and vigor. <br/><br/>“Tell me.” <br/><br/>Michael Jackson nodded: “We fought against the Darknight Alliance’s forces, and Thomas Firway was wounded by Darknight Alliance’s leader, Emma Clark.” <br/><br/>“Darknight Alliance.” Kevin Clark repeated, “So the one who injured Thomas <br/><br/>Firway...” <br/><br/>“It should be that Nameless killer.” Michael Jackson said, “After all, only he could have injured Thomas Firway like this. There wouldn’t be a second person in the Darknight Alliance who could do it.” <br/><br/>Darknight Alliance was an organization in D Continent. A few years ago, a new enforcer suddenly appeared in the alliance and was very powerful. No one had seen his face. His age, gender, and everything else was unknown. <br/><br/>So everyone called him “Nameless.” <br/><br/>Michael Jackson said: “Truro has been quite lively recently. Roy Ryder, Emma Clark, and even the normally absent from the domestic scene, Nameless, are all here. Third Master, do you want to call some people over from Imperial Capital?” <br/><br/>“No need.” Kevin Clark said softly, “In these years, we have been living in peace with the Darknight Alliance in D Continent. I didn’t expect to become enemies again. ” Ëxpłœrę thë ørîgîn øf thïš ďåtå, ðëëplÿ røøtëd ïn n0v[lb¡n★<br/><br/>With the desolate tone in his voice, Michael Jackson didn’t dare to speak and lightened his breath even more. <br/><br/>“Notify the people in D Continent that we want all the things Darknight <br/><br/>Alliance wants.” <br/><br/>“Yes, sir.” <br/><br/>After Michael Jackson left the study room, Kevin Clark bent down to finish the last character, put down the brush, and then turned to the French window to send a message to Allonzo Hobson. <br/><br/>[How is the matter going?] <br/><br/>Allonzo Hobson immediately called: “Arthur, guess who is the person behind <br/><br/>Olivia Chester.” <br/><br/>“who?” <br/><br/>“The Giovanni Family. That... The family that’s been reported online to be able to contend with us in the Entertainment Industry.” Allonzo Hobson said, <br/><br/>“Olivia Chester has been Vincent Giovanni’s mistress for quite some years. <br/><br/>Vincent is almost sixty years old, right?” <br/><br/>“Also, also...” Hill Dawson couldn’t help but laugh, “Olivia Chester and Vincent Giovanni are having an affair, and now someone has exposed it. Clear photos, ironclad evidence. That hot search exploded in five minutes. Olivia Chester and John Anderson have been trying to suppress the search, but they can’t get it down.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane: . She has a free Celestial Pivot to use, but she’s one step behind others. <br/><br/>“I’ve already talked to the director on the phone, and there’s no problem with ‘Fall of the Quince’. But that Clarissa Mason who was forcibly added definitely can’t be used now.” Hill Dawson laughed for a while and said, “You just relax and wait, wait to join the crew.” <br/><br/>After hanging up the phone, Daisy Zane looked at her cellphone for a while. <br/><br/>Then she sent a message to Holt Lawrence: [Inefficient, blocked!] <br/><br/>Twenty minutes later, Kevin Clark came knocking on the door, bringing breakfast and a wooden box. <br/><br/>“Not feverish anymore.” Kevin Clark saw that her face had improved a lot, and her eyes were no longer red. <br/><br/>“Mm.” Daisy Zane watched him familiarly take a pair of disposable slippers for her to change into and said, “You could bring a pair of slippers from your house.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark raised an eyebrow: “Alright. Next time.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane sat down at the dining table, while Kevin Clark went to the kitchen to get bowls and chopsticks, and then unpacked the bought breakfast one by one. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane did nothing but waited to eat. <br/><br/>Halfway through the meal, there suddenly came an opening door sound from the guest room, followed by footsteps. The two looked at the restaurant entrance simultaneously. <br/><br/>A few seconds later, Robinson Scott appeared at the entrance, wearing a set of gray pajamas, his hair messy and his eyes barely open: “Daisy, you finally started eating breakfast, it smells delicious.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark glanced at him and then looked away, while Daisy Zane asked, “Waking up early?” <br/><br/>“I came back before midnight last night. You didn’t hear... Ah!!!” Robinson Scott opened his eyes, saw the person sitting opposite Daisy Zane, and yelled in fright, “Fairy Clan!” Daisy Zane: . <br/><br/>“Fairy?” Kevin Clark repeated. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane: “...Praising you.” <br/><br/>“Really?” Kevin Clark looked at Daisy Zane with a smile, seeming to examine her. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane also looked at him, her tone a bit cold: “Yes.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark laughed, accepting the nickname. He was afraid that if he said anything else, the little girl’s slap would be coming. <br/><br/>“Hello, Kevin Clark.” Kevin Clark looked at Robinson Scott and introduced himself. <br/><br/>Robinson Scott felt his gaze and realized something in their conversation. She said, “Robinson Scott.” <br/><br/>“Want to eat?” Daisy Zane asked. <br/><br/>“I won’t eat, I’ll just have a drink.” As Robinson Scott spoke, she glanced at Kevin Clark and turned to go to the kitchen. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark felt deep hostility in that glance. <br/><br/>After having some water in the kitchen, Robinson Scott went to sit on the sofa in the living room, staring at the dining room. She seemed to exude an attitude that if Kevin Clark made any improper moves, she would take him down..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
