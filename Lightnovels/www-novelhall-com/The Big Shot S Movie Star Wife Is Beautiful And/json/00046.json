Through the glass, he saw her sitting up and smiled gently. <br/><br/>Then, after saying a few more words to Allonzo Hobson and the others, he came over to her. <br/><br/>He poured her a glass of water: “You’re awake?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at his eyes, which were no longer as red: “Mmhmm, when did you wake up?” <br/><br/>“About twenty minutes ago,” Kevin Clark replied with a smile. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane nodded and took a sip of her water. Folding the blanket and placing it aside, she stood up: “It’s getting late. I should go.” <br/><br/>“Stay for dinner.” Kevin Clark said, “Red Date and Lotus Seed Porridge, made with local ingredients. Michael Jackson’s cooking skills were trained by the master at the Doomsday Hotel.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised an eyebrow: “Assistant Jackson sure is versatile.” “What about me?” Kevin Clark suddenly asked. <br/><br/>Taken aback by his question, Daisy Zane hesitated for a moment. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark appeared not to have expected his own question either, and chuckled lightly, “I’m just joking.” <br/><br/>He felt like he might have been influenced by Michael Jackson’s competitiveness, such childish comparisons. He should find a driver-cum-bodyguard to replace Michael Jackson. <br/><br/>“You’re even more versatile,” Daisy Zane said. <br/><br/>Hearing her answer, a deeper smile appeared in Kevin Clark’s eyes. <br/><br/>As Daisy Zane held her phone in one hand and raised the other hand to touch her neck, she forwarded the audio recording from Serena Buster to Holt Lawrence, instructing him to release it tonight. <br/><br/>She also took the opportunity to ask him for a thorough background check on Lilian Lopez. <br/><br/>Just after sending the message and putting the phone away, she saw a reflection on Kevin Clark. <br/><br/>Without thinking, she swiftly moved to his side and pushed him into a blind spot at the corner. <br/><br/>There was a small wooden pavilion beside the sunroom, which just happened to block the view from outside. <br/><br/>Due to the swiftness of Daisy Zane’s actions, she knocked the glasses on the small round table to the ground, breaking them. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark was a bit slow to react, and just as Daisy Zane pressed him against the glass, he instinctively wrapped his arm around her waist to prevent her from falling. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane guessed that Olivia Chester must have failed to find someone to help with their connection. Even though the bank card she had used wasn’t linked to her identity information, if she was investigated, she would not have an easy time without any useful connections. <br/><br/>“Isn’t it being resolved?” Daisy said, “How to solve it next depends on the police station’s procedures.” <br/><br/>“What do you want!” Lilian Lopez threw the nail file to the ground. <br/><br/>“Do nothing, you don’t want me to mix in this circle, and I don’t want you to mix in this circle, isn’t that fair?” <br/><br/>“Daisy Zane, don’t refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a penalty.” Lilian Lopez stood up and said, “Do you know the simplest way to ruin a woman? Ruin her innocence.” <br/><br/>Lilian Lopez laughed, her eyes malicious: “Did you see the three of them? You’d better agree with me today and settle with the police. Otherwise, you won’t be able to leave this room. And various dirty photos of you will be flying all over the place tomorrow.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s brows twitched lightly. <br/><br/>Lilian Lopez took two steps towards her and said: “Not only will you not be able to make it in this circle, but you’ll also become a street mouse in this world that everyone wants to beat.” <br/><br/>“What if I say no?” Daisy Zane’s mouth curved in a faint smile. <br/><br/>“Good, you’re a tough nut to crack.” Lilian Lopez said, “Well then, enjoy yourself tonight. ” <br/><br/>After finishing her words, Lilian Lopez sat back on the sofa and made a gesture to the three men. <br/><br/>One of them went to grab a camera while the other two took off their suit jackets and walked towards her. <br/><br/>Lilian Lopez had an expression of watching a show, and her assistant stood by, her head down and shivering. <br/><br/>As the man approached her, Daisy Zane immediately kicked one of them to the ground, and before the other man could resist, threw a punch at his face and knocked him down as well. <br/><br/>The man holding the camera hesitated for a moment before rushing over. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane dodged to the side, grabbed his wrist and twisted it, disarming him. <br/><br/>The camera fell to the floor and broke. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane kicked him on the lower leg, knocking him to the ground as well. <br/><br/>All three men lay on the ground, the first one unable to get up even after two attempts. Daisy Zane didn’t even change her expression from beginning to end. <br/><br/>Lilian Lopez stood up in fright, her face pale. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane shook her wrist and whispered, “Either get lost or die.” <br/><br/>Like a sentence from the depths of hell, the three men were scared to climb up and ran out the door immediately. <br/><br/>“Now it’s just you.” Daisy Zane looked at Lilian Lopez and approached her step by step. <br/><br/>For a moment, Lilian Lopez thought Daisy Zane was like a madwoman. <br/><br/>She began to tremble uncontrollably, and as Daisy Zane was about to approach her, she turned to run. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane moved forward two steps, and her hand went from behind to the front to grab her throat. <br/><br/>Lilian Lopez instinctively raised her hand to hold onto the hand gripping her throat. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane took down the hairpin from her hair, and her black hair cascaded over her shoulders. She pressed the hairpin against Lilian Lopez’s tender face, whispering in her ear, “You should be glad that I’ve restrained myself a lot now. Otherwise...” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s hand exerted a bit of force, and the hairpin pressed deeper into her face, “I would’ve peeled off your face..”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
