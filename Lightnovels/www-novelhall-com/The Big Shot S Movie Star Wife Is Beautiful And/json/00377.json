After a couple of seconds, she picked up her chopsticks again. She had to admit that the fairy was too handsome, and he looked good when he smiled. She was taken in by his looks: “Forget it, I’m hungry, and I don’t have the energy.” <br/><br/>This time, Kevin Clark laughed out loud. How could the little girl be so cute? <br/><br/>Daisy Zane: <br/><br/>After dinner, the two of them tidied up the places they hadn’t cleaned before and then lay down on the bed. <br/><br/>As soon as they lay down, Kevin Clark’s arm stretched over Daisy Zane’s neck, hooked her and held her in his arms. <br/><br/>“Kevin Clark, this is not Imperial Capital.” <br/><br/>“I know.” <br/><br/>“Do you know how many degrees it is here?” <br/><br/>“There’s a big temperature difference in the mountains, and it gets cold at night,” Kevin Clark said warmly, “holding you will keep me warm.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane: <br/><br/>Kevin Clark gave her a gentle kiss on her forehead and whispered, “Go to sleep. Do you need me to sing you a lullaby?” <br/><br/>“No rush, we can stay here for a few more days.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn’t respond after taking a sip of wine. She knew Kevin Clark was busy lately and felt a bit headstrong for having him accompany her here. <br/><br/>The two were silent for a while, listening to the dripping sound outside. When the heart is restless, everything is irritating; when the heart is calm, nature becomes perfect music. <br/><br/>After listening to the rain for a while, Kevin Clark asked, “How long did you live here back then?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane swirled the wine glass and said, “More than half a year. Although the conditions here were very poor, beyond my understanding. I knew that some places had bad conditions, but there’s a difference between knowing and experiencing it firsthand. However, this place is very peaceful and calming. Daisy ?When she’s not scolding anyone, she’s really good at comforting people, and it’s very comfortable to be with her.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s chin rested on her shoulder, watching her eyelashes while listening to her talk. <br/><br/>“She has a great personality, and she’s optimistic. She’s happy every day. Even after a fight here, she would turn around and sing happily. What we saw in her was always her expectation for life and hope for the future.” <br/><br/>“So the person who is similar to Anisa Cooper is her.” <br/><br/>“Yeah,” Daisy Zane said, “But Anisa is more like a child, and Lucia is like a sister. Anisa needs protection, while Lucia protects others.” <br/><br/>Every time Anisa laughed, Daisy would feel a little comforted in her heart. <br/><br/>Especially on April 15, when Anisa was angry and laughing because of Claudia Zane’s injustice that was finally cleared. For a moment, it felt as if Daisy was standing in front of her. <br/><br/>“Although I really like it here, there are still many things I haven’t done. I’m also worried about Wilton Edwards and Charles Amos, so I left.” <br/><br/>“But you visited often afterward, right?” Kevin Clark asked. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane finished her wine and put the glass aside, “I came back once every two or three months.” <br/><br/>Except for a year-long training period, no matter where she was or how busy she was, she would come back once every two or three months. <br/><br/>“I originally wanted to take Lucia and her grandma away,” Daisy Zane leaned back on Kevin Clark and said. “But her grandma insisted on not leaving, very determined. So I tried my best to improve their living conditions. Every time I came back, I brought many things from the outside.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark could see that many things here were bought from the outside. Some of them were even unusable due to the poor conditions here. <br/><br/>“Lucia was very curious about the outside world. Since she couldn’t go out, I would buy things from outside as much as possible, bring them back and introduce them to her one by one. I also took many photos of the outside world and showed them to her.” <br/><br/>“Then the more she looked, the more curious she became, and the more she wanted to go out,” Kevin Clark said with a smile. <br/><br/>“Yes. So she secretly left Cold Green Village twice without telling her grandma.” Daisy’s tone also turned into a smile, “And then she saw Phoebe Turner’s billboard in town.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark now understood why Daisy’s scripts would almost always invite Phoebe Turner. <br/><br/>Because the real Daisy loved her. <br/><br/>“Lucia and I learned about Phoebe Turner. After learning that she was an actress, we learned about many acting-related things. Later on, we learned about many Best Actresses and the entertainment industry.” <br/><br/>“And then she had a dream of becoming a Best Actress,” Kevin Clark said softly. <br/><br/>“Yes. She couldn’t possibly stay here all her life.” <br/><br/>“It’s all from the information you brought from outside,” Kevin Clark said. <br/><br/>“Of course, there’s no signal here, and she has no way of knowing anything,” Daisy Zane closed her eyes and recalled, ” I visited very frequently during that time. I brought a lot of related materials, as well as Phoebe Turner’s autographs and merchandise.” <br/><br/>“Wasn’t that a period of being a fan?” Kevin Clark tried to imagine the scene but couldn’t. <br/><br/>She missed too much of Lucia’s life. <br/><br/>“Not just that. To get closer to the star, she even wrote scripts.” <br/><br/>Speaking of which, she opened her eyes and looked at the pitch-dark night. <br/><br/>During that time, visiting Cold Green Village and seeing Daisy was the only light in her life. <br/><br/>She desperately held onto that light, but in the end, it still disappeared.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
