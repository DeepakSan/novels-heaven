Olivia Lane, on the other hand, looked at her, her eyelashes trembling momentarily before she lowered her eyes.<br/><br/>The English passage Daisy read aloud wasn’t very long. After she finished, the teacher praised her and said, “Listen carefully,” before letting her sit down.<br/><br/>Then, Olivia Lane was called to read the next passage.<br/><br/>The paper Olivia placed on her desk was a few days old.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane put her own paper directly on Olivia’s desk and pointed to the passage she was to read.<br/><br/>Olivia first looked at Daisy’s fingertip, then looked at the portrait Daisy had drawn of her.<br/><br/>Although the sketch was only halfway completed, it was clearly of her.<br/><br/>Olivia glanced at Daisy Zane.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised her eyebrows and smiled at her.<br/><br/>Leaning forward, Olivia lowered her voice and said quickly, “You’re violating my portrait rights.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane smiled and said, “You can choose to sue me. I’ll pay.”<br/><br/>Olivia glanced at her, almost speechless. She didn’t say anything else and started reading the passage aloud: “Generalists, on the other hand, know a lot about a wide... ‘<br/><br/>Olivia Lane’s voice had always been pleasant. It was soft, a little raw, and a bit languid.<br/><br/>Her pronunciation was naturally very accurate. Still, if one listened carefully, it wasn’t hard to notice that it was somewhat similar to Daisy Zane’s.<br/><br/>Olivia quickly finished reading and then looked at their teacher.<br/><br/>The teacher looked at her, then at Daisy Zane, and said, “Did you two learn your pronunciation from each other? It’s both similar and distinct.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn’t mind; she thought the girl was just trying to tease her by imitating her pronunciation.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Olivia listened to the teacher and looked at Daisy Zane.<br/><br/>Her English was taught by a foreign housekeeper at home.<br/><br/>That housekeeper’s accent was like this, so her pronunciation became like this as well.<br/><br/>“Alright, Olivia, you can sit down now,” the teacher said.<br/><br/>Olivia sat down and stared at the paper without moving.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark looked at the black computer screen, and then sent Daisy Zane another message: 1.......1<br/><br/>Daisy Zane replied with eight characters: [Focus on your work; beauty distracts.]<br/><br/>Daisy Zane entered the office, where two unfamiliar teachers were present. She nodded in greeting and then went over to Skyler Thomas’ desk.<br/><br/>She leaned against the desk and waited for Skyler Thomas to arrive.<br/><br/>When he saw her, he smiled first: “I wanted to talk to you about not having the camera follow you anymore, but I see you’ve already arranged it.”<br/><br/>As Skyler Thomas spoke, he pulled a chair over to her and said, “Sit.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane sat down and looked at him, saying, “It’s because of William Butch’s situation.”<br/><br/>“Yes,” Skyler Thomas replied. “This child is really worrying me. This morning, I called his parents behind his back. His mother answered, saying she was abroad and too busy to come back. His father’s phone was unreachable.” “What happened after that?” Daisy Zane asked quietly.<br/><br/>“I thought this kind of situation needed to be handled by both the school and the family,” Skyler Thomas rubbed his temples and said. “So I called his grandmother according to the information he provided when he started school. But she said it’s normal for boys to fight, and there’s no need to intervene. He’ll be fine later.’<br/><br/>Daisy Zane: .<br/><br/>“I just started working with them, and I only knew that William Butch was usually quiet and unwilling to talk. I never expected him to be bullied,” Skyler Thomas said. “This is a serious matter, and if it continues, he’ll develop psychological problems.”<br/><br/>“Do you think he doesn’t have psychological problems now?”<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Based on Daisy Zane’s observations, William Butch’s psychological problems were severe.<br/><br/>“What should I do?” Skyler Thomas asked. “I tried to counsel him this morning, but he had no reaction whatsoever, and his family isn’t cooperating.”<br/><br/>“He was beaten up again at noon,” Daisy Zane said.<br/><br/>Skyler Thomas furrowed his brows: “This child... I’ve been in the profession for many years, and he’s not the first case I’ve encountered like this. But I’ve never seen someone like William Butch, who seems not to hear anything and doesn’t respond.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at him without saying anything.<br/><br/>“Daisy, do you have a solution?” Skyler Thomas asked. “I saw you stopping me in the morning and thought you might have a solution. His family doesn’t care, and I’m really worried that he might go through a more severe situation.<br/><br/>That’s why I bothered you during the recording.”<br/><br/>She blinked her eyelashes gently and asked, “How old is he?”<br/><br/>“Fifteen,” replied Skyler Thomas.<br/><br/>“So young?” Daisy Zane remarked.<br/><br/>“His grades were excellent before, and he skipped two grades in middle school,” Skyler Thomas stated. “But his current grades are terrible, almost at the bottom of the entire school.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
