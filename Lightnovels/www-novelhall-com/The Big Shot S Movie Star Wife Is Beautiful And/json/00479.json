She even designed it herself, isn’t that impressive?” <br/><br/>The agent, who’s been helping out front, came over and saw her necklace and earrings. He said, “Why didn’t you wear a Spotlight set? As the spokesperson for Spotlight, it doesn’t look good wearing jewelry from other stores.” <br/><br/>“I’m wearing a Spotlight ring.” <br/><br/>Agent:? Global spokesperson, and she chose to wear the sponsored jewelry in the least noticeable part of her body, her hand. <br/><br/>Realizing he couldn’t sway her, the agent turned to Allonzo Hobson. <br/><br/>Allonzo Hobson said, “Isn’t it designed by Daisy? In that case, it’s fine. Just wear it.” <br/><br/>Agent: <br/><br/>Without further explanation, Allonzo Hobson said, “Mom, you and Dad should take some photos. Have someone edit them and post them on Facebook. I’ll go ahead.” <br/><br/>Although the banquet hadn’t started, they needed to build up the hype online first. Upstodatee from n(0)/ve/lbIn/.(co/m<br/><br/>“Wait a moment.” Phoebe Turner stopped him, “Where’s Robinson Scott? Why hasn’t he arrived yet?” <br/><br/>Allonzo Hobson checked the time, “Ten minutes, he’ll be here within ten minutes.” <br/><br/>“Alright. Off you go.” <br/><br/>After Allonzo Hobson left, George Hobson and Phoebe Turner posed for some photos, giving a loving display. They had the pictures edited and then Phoebe Turner posted them on Facebook. <br/><br/>As soon as the post went up, fans flooded in. <br/><br/>Most of the comments were praising Phoebe Turner, with a few people giving George Hobson perfunctory compliments as well. <br/><br/>Of course, there were those who sang a different tune, saying their marriage only existed in name. <br/><br/>Phoebe Turner ignored them and saw a comment praising her necklace. She thought for a moment, then replied: [It was gifted by Daisy, who also designed it herself.] <br/><br/>The jewelry designs were excellent, not inferior to any major brand currently available. <br/><br/>Such talent shouldn’t be buried. <br/><br/>Moreover, Phoebe Turner often saw posts mocking Daisy Zane for her lack of education and origin in the Countryside. <br/><br/>So she thought she could build a positive image and directly address the situation. <br/><br/>Little did she know that her kind words would unintentionally cause trouble. <br/><br/>The banquet hadn’t started yet. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark and Daisy Zane left Phoebe Turner and went to the Rest Area. <br/><br/>After the two sat there for a while, Daisy Zane asked, “Who else from your family is here besides you?” <br/><br/>“My eldest brother and his family are here,” Kevin Clark said. “Do you want to go meet them?” <br/><br/>“Yes.” Daisy Zane got up. <br/><br/>“If you don’t want to meet them, you don’t have to,” Kevin Clark said, sitting on the sofa, holding her hand, and looking up at her. “Don’t worry about it too much, just take it easy.” <br/><br/>“It’s not that I don’t want to meet them. It’s been a long time since I last saw them, so I should see them now.” Daisy Zane pulled Kevin Clark up with force. <br/><br/>The two of them went to the Inner Hall area. <br/><br/>Fortunately, Kevin Clark had always allowed Daisy Zane to address others as she pleased, not forcing her to follow any specific habit. <br/><br/>As the Lane couple stood up, Theo Clark and Calvin Stewart also came over. Hugo Clark and Roy Madison had no choice but to join them, standing together. <br/><br/>Calvin Stewart said: “This is the third brother’s wife. They got their certificates but haven’t held the wedding banquet yet, so they haven’t told everyone.” <br/><br/>Andrew Lane’s face visibly fell. He lowered his gaze and saw the ring on Daisy Zane’s left hand. <br/><br/>He closed his eyes, and his teeth began to ache faintly. <br/><br/>“She looks like a good girl.” Sophie Ortiz looked at Daisy Zane, her smile becoming more and more kind. So kind that it made Roy Madison and Amelie Quentin’s hairs stand on end when they saw it. <br/><br/>Their mother would chase them around the Lane Family Estate twice when she hit them. <br/><br/>The word “kind” had nothing to do with their mother. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark saw them suddenly gather around Daisy Zane and start chatting. And after Calvin Stewart praised her, Sophie Ortiz praised her too. Daisy Zane was caught in the middle, unable to get a word in, just smiling. <br/><br/>He was worried that Daisy Zane might be uncomfortable, so he pulled her out of the crowd and said, “You guys chat first, we’ll go outside.” <br/><br/>Calvin Stewart responded quickly and cooperatively: “Go ahead, go ahead. You young people should go out and have fun, no need to keep us company here.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark took Daisy Zane out without paying attention to anyone else. <br/><br/>Andrew Lane watched Kevin Clark’s receding figure and then looked at Sophie Ortiz. <br/><br/>Although he didn’t say anything, that look clearly meant: <br/><br/>Look at him, look at him, so arrogant! Self-indulgent! Proud and complacent! <br/><br/>Who would marry their daughter to him! <br/><br/>I disagree with this marriage! <br/><br/>“In the future, when I’m not around and you don’t want to deal with these things, just leave.” Kevin Clark held her hand and said, “Mrs. Clark has the right to be arrogant.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised her eyebrows. <br/><br/>“But... I’m really curious,” Kevin Clark straightened her skirt hem, “Why do all the Lanes like you? They’re famously cold and emotionless towards outsiders.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane: <br/><br/>“Why are they so enthusiastic about you? Is it because my wife is so likeable?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane hesitated for a while and stopped walking. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark also stopped with her: “What’s wrong?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at him and paused before saying: “Kevin Clark, actually...” <br/><br/>“Brother Nine!” Robinson Scott started shouting from three meters away, interrupting Daisy Zane before rushing over and hugging her.” <br/><br/>Due to inertia, Robinson Scott hugged Daisy Zane and stumbled forward two steps. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark supported Daisy Zane at the waist and stopped her. <br/><br/>Robinson Scott released her after a hug: “Did you miss me?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s words were interrupted, she coldly replied: “No.” <br/><br/>Robinson Scott: <br/><br/>Allonzo Hobson walked over just in time to hear that sentence, laughed, and then received a glare from Robinson Scott. <br/><br/>“Brother Nine, you’re just insincere,” Robinson Scott stood next to Daisy Zane, “Brother Nine, I got three hairpins from my father’s warehouse and put them in Celestial Pivot. Don’t worry, they’re all items from the living world. Take a look when you have time.” <br/><br/>“Okay.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
