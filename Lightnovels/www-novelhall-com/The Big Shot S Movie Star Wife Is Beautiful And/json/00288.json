Her pink lips were slightly pursed, her expression indescribably melancholic.<br/><br/>Her sister was also allergic to olives and would develop a rash.<br/><br/>She too had said that eating just a bit wasn’t a problem.<br/><br/>Back when she was five years old, in kindergarten, the teacher gave her three pieces of cloud cake. Thinking it was delicious, she saved two for her sister.<br/><br/>After returning home, she eagerly waited for her sister. When her sister came home from school, she presented her with the two pieces of cloud cake like they were treasure.<br/><br/>She informed her sister that she had saved them specially for her.<br/><br/>Not wanting to disappoint her, even though her sister knew she was allergic to olives, she still ate one piece and left one for Amelie Quentin.<br/><br/>As a result, she broke out in a rash that same evening.<br/><br/>That night, no one in the family slept. Her older brother, parents, grandfather, everyone stayed up looking after her sister. Only when the rash that had covered her sister’s body subsided did they all breathe a sigh of relief.<br/><br/>Although no one blamed her, everyone tried to comfort her in the midst of their worry.<br/><br/>Despite this, she continued to cry.<br/><br/>Her sister lay in bed, receiving an IV drip, while holding her hand, reassuring her it was okay, that eating just a bit wouldn’t hurt.<br/><br/>Recalling this, Amelie Quentin checked the time, descended from the rooftop, and headed straight to the medical office.<br/><br/>Clark Manor<br/><br/>After finishing his work, Harton Clark, thinking of Charles Amos who was still at the Clark Manor, decided to return home first.<br/><br/>Upon arriving, he saw Charles was holding up both his little hands, helping his mother with her knitting.<br/><br/>“Mom, it’s only September, why are you knitting again?” Wayne glanced at him, “So many flowers and plants, don’t they need new clothes for the New Year?”<br/><br/>Every year, Tom Wayne knitted covers for the various vases in their home.<br/><br/>“Uncle Clark.” Charles called his name,<br/><br/>Harton Clark lightly tousled his hair, then sat down, “Where is my father?”<br/><br/>“He’s talking with your brother in the backyard.” Tom Wayne said, “Why are you home at this hour? Is something wrong?”<br/><br/>“Yeah,” Harton Clark looked at Charles, “I need to discuss something with Charles.”<br/><br/>Charles looked at him.<br/><br/>Tom Wayne also glanced at him. From just that one glance, Tom Wayne understood Harton Clark’s intent.<br/><br/>Harton Clark drew Charles away with him.<br/><br/>The two of them walked side by side in silence, taking a seemingly random path.<br/><br/>One big, one small – they walked side by side in silence, neither of them speaking.<br/><br/>“Be prepared.” Kevin Clark removed the bracelet from his wrist and twirled it in his hands. “Bring more people, heighten the vigil.”<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>With one hand twirling the Eaglewood beads, and the other holding his cell phone, Kevin sent a message to William Lane informing him about Henry Clark being in Imperial Capital.<br/><br/>This was his calculated move to use another’s hand to kill.<br/><br/>As long as Henry Clark stayed quietly abroad, Kevin might have let him go.<br/><br/>But Henry Clark insisted on returning to his homeland.<br/><br/>A little more than a decade ago, this man almost caused the death of Hugo Clark. His father, out of blood ties, spared his life and sent him abroad.<br/><br/>But now...it was becoming clear that they needed to remove the root while cutting off the weed...<br/><br/>After Kevin Clark left, little Charles continued to help Natalie Wayne with her knitting, then assembled his Lego next to her.<br/><br/>The Lego set was a gift from Hugo Clark. Once assembled, it would be taller than Charles, who was only building the foundation now.<br/><br/>It would take quite some time to complete.<br/><br/>After assembling for a while, Grandpa Clark, using his cane, came by. Charles greeted him with a “Grandpa” and resumed his assembly after a while.<br/><br/>While assembling, he kept glancing over at Grandpa Clark and Natalie Wayne.<br/><br/>Although Grandpa Clark was old, his eyesight was quite good. To be honest, he didn’t even need to look. He had experienced so much in his life, having witnessed a whole era of changes.<br/><br/>Being a little boy, Charles had a curious mind. Even if Grandpa Clark was facing away from him, he could still sense his little thoughts.<br/><br/>So, after Grandpa Clark finished talking with Natalie Wayne, he looked at Charles, “Charles, is there something you want to talk to grandpa and grandma about?”<br/><br/>Charles pursed his lips, put down his Lego, and walked over to them.<br/><br/>Natalie Wayne also put down her needle, looked at him, and gently asked with a smile, “What’s the matter? Unhappy?”<br/><br/>“Is something bothering you?” Natalie Wayne asked, “Is it because of Kevin and your mom?”<br/><br/>Charles nodded.<br/><br/>Natalie Wayne sighed inwardly, feeling a bit reproachful towards Kevin. He hadn’t managed the situation properly before leaving.<br/><br/>“You can talk to grandpa and grandma.” Natalie moved forward, took his little hand and said.<br/><br/>After looking at Grandpa Clark and then at Natalie Wayne, Charles said: “Grandma, Grandpa, I’m going to tell you a secret. Can you promise not to tell anyone else?”<br/><br/>“Of course.” Natalie immediately agreed.<br/><br/>Charles then looked at Grandpa Clark.<br/><br/>Grandpa Clark promptly replied, “Of course.”<br/><br/>Once both of them had agreed, Charles finally said, “Actually... my mom... she is<br/><br/>Daisy Zane. We don’t have any blood relationship.”<br/><br/>Natalie Wayne and Grandpa Clark clearly were taken aback, and they exchanged a look.<br/><br/>They had not expected the young boy to suddenly share this with them.<br/><br/>Charles continued, “Technically, she adopted me. But... because she was quite young and didn’t meet the criteria required for adopting me, legally... there’s no relation between us.”<br/><br/>His voice faltered, a hint of desolation apparent, as he spoke about them not being related..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
