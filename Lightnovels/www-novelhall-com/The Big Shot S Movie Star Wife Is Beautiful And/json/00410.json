Daisy Zane, besides being with Tom Wayne and Calvin Stewart at the Clark Manor, also completed more than half of the script. <br/><br/>The Maxwell Family came the first night without seeing Kevin Clark. <br/><br/>They came again the next day, but Kevin Clark was not at home, so they didn’t stay long. <br/><br/>On the third day, Kevin Clark and Daisy Zane returned to the Rose Garden. <br/><br/>As soon as they arrived at the Rose Garden, less than an hour later, the Maxwells arrived. <br/><br/>Both of them were in the study room, Daisy Zane looked at Kevin Clark. Kevin Clark said, “I’ll go down and see.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane nodded in agreement and continued to finish the script. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark went downstairs, and Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell were already seated in the living room on the ground floor. <br/><br/>The servant had also made tea for them. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark went downstairs, and Julian Maxwell and his wife quickly stood up: “Kevin.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark walked to the sofa: “Please, have a seat.” <br/><br/>After saying that, he sat down, and Julian Maxwell and his wife sat down too. <br/><br/>“Kevin, sorry to trouble you by suddenly coming over,” Julian Maxwell said. Mrs. Maxwell smiled politely on the side. Geett the latest novels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om<br/><br/>Although her smile was polite, it couldn’t hide the tiredness in Mrs. Maxwell’s eyes. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark took a sip of tea. When his face was not smiling, he carried an oppressive feeling: “Mr. Maxwell, please, just say it.” <br/><br/>Julian Maxwell’s smile froze for a moment, and then he said, “Kevin, as you should have guessed, we came here for Clara Mitchell’s sake.” <br/><br/>Mrs. Maxwell nodded on the side. <br/><br/>Julian Maxwell continued: “I know, Clara did something wrong. If she did something wrong, she should be punished, but isn’t this too heavy?” <br/><br/>“Is it really that heavy?” Kevin Clark asked softly, “I think it’s too light.” <br/><br/>Julian Maxwell licked his dry lips: “Kevin, Clara did do something wrong. But considering the friendship between our two families, and her growing up with you, couldn’t you let her off? Besides The situation with Lady Zane has been cleared up, and this incident didn’t cause her any loss ” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark placed the teacup on the tea table, making a soft noise. <br/><br/>Julian Maxwell immediately stopped talking, and Mrs. Maxwell held her breath. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark looked up at Julian Maxwell, his eyes narrow and cold. He said, “The fact that there was no loss is the result of my wife’s timely handling. What does it have to do with Clara Mitchell? She caused trouble for us, and in the end, there was no loss. Am I supposed to thank her? ” <br/><br/>“Please leave, both of you.” <br/><br/>After saying this, Kevin Clark stood up, didn’t even look at them, and turned to go upstairs. <br/><br/>Julian Maxwell stared blankly at Kevin Clark’s retreating figure. When he reached the staircase, Mrs. Maxwell suddenly shouted, “Third Master Clark, are you really going to put Clara Mitchell to death? She likes you so much! She has liked you for so many years. She went this way because she likes you too much. Can you spare her once for her love all these years?” <br/><br/>Mrs. Maxwell suddenly sobbed, “Third Master Clark, please spare her. From now on, the Maxwell Family will be at your disposal. An extra helper is always better than an extra opponent.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark stopped and, without looking back, said softly, “Opponent? You can try to see what the Maxwell Family can do to me.” <br/><br/>Third Master didn’t even consider the Maxwell Family worth his attention. <br/><br/>“Stay quiet, and maybe the Maxwell Family can survive.” <br/><br/>After saying these words, Kevin Clark went upstairs. <br/><br/>The Maxwell couple stood in the living room for a while before being shown out. <br/><br/>Study Room <br/><br/>Just as Kevin Clark was about to open the door, he saw a crack at the top. <br/><br/>He raised his eyebrows, pushed the door open, and entered the study room. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane was still sitting on the sofa with the computer, writing a script. She didn’t even look up when she heard him come in. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark approached and sat down on the sofa, embracing her from behind, “Little Girl, you eavesdropped.” <br/><br/>“Isn’t that allowed?” <br/><br/>“It is,” Kevin Clark’s head nuzzled her neck, “anything is allowed.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane glanced at him, hooked the corner of her mouth. He was just downstairs wishing to kill someone, and now he was being this gentle. <br/><br/>“Little Girl, are you busy recently?” Kevin Clark suddenly asked. <br/><br/>“Not bad, what’s up?” <br/><br/>“I want to take you to Mountain Sea Continent for a few days,” Kevin Clark kissed her on the neck. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised her eyebrows. She was planning to pick a time to go back to the Mountain Sea Continent soon. It had been too long since she had been back, and she had some free time recently. <br/><br/>“There is a training selection, you should be interested,” Kevin Clark said. <br/><br/>He admitted that he had a selfish motive. He didn’t want to be apart from the little girl for too long. <br/><br/>Half a month was a bit too long. <br/><br/>After thinking about it, it was better to take her with him. <br/><br/>“Alright, let’s go and check it out.” <br/><br/>“Okay,” Kevin Clark smiled and agreed.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
