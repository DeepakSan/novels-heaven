He said that he specifically flew back from abroad just to see you. Do you want to meet him?] <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at the message and hesitated before replying: [Let’s meet.] <br/><br/>After replying to the message, Daisy Zane looked at the stage, which was about to end. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark noticed her intention: “Shall we go?” <br/><br/>“Yes.” <br/><br/>The two left the venue a little early and went out through the side gate to get some fresh air. <br/><br/>Seeing that Daisy Zane had left, Amelia Miles also quickly got up and left. <br/><br/>“Are we not going back?” After leaving the side gate, Kevin Clark held her hand and walked out. <br/><br/>After walking a distance from the side gate of the Doomsday Hotel’s banquet hall, they crossed the road and found a snack street. <br/><br/>“Mmm, I still have to meet someone later.” <br/><br/>“Joseph Allen?” Kevin Clark asked. <br/><br/>“He’s one of them.’ <br/><br/>“You’re even busier than me.” Kevin Clark said, helping her lift her skirt as they climbed up two steps, “Is it hot?” <br/><br/>“It’s okay.” <br/><br/>“Do you want to eat ice cream?” Kevin Clark asked her. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at him, a faint smile appearing in her eyes: “Is there any up there?” <br/><br/>“Yes.” , said Kevin Clark. “We can eat an ice cream and then go back, there’s still time.” <br/><br/>As the two walked towards the snack street, Amelia Miles followed them out and stopped at the door, not going any further. <br/><br/>She just kept watching their backs. <br/><br/>It was not until they had gradually disappeared from sight that she withdrew her gaze and prepared to return to the conference hall to find John Anderson. <br/><br/>However, as soon as she turned around, she saw a woman not far behind her looking at her. <br/><br/>The woman was wearing a red dress, and her already seductive appearance was enhanced by the sexy red dress. <br/><br/>Amelia Miles looked at her, and the woman smiled at her before slowly walking over in her high heels. <br/><br/>“Hello, Miss Miles.” <br/><br/>Amelia Miles looked at her and said, “You are...” <br/><br/>“My name is Bonnie Maxwell.” <br/><br/>“Do you even believe in rumors?” Bonnie Maxwell said, “Before Daisy Zane, Kevin Clark hadn’t even touched someone else’s hand.” <br/><br/>Then why did he fall for Daisy Zane of all people? Would the Clark family allow such a woman to join their family? <br/><br/>“Let me remind you, Kevin Clark’s mother really likes Daisy Zane.” <br/><br/>Amelia gradually couldn’t feel the pain anymore, even having difficulty breathing. <br/><br/>Seeing her like this, a sneer flashed across Bonnie Maxwell’s eyes: “I’ve said all I have to say, it’s up to you now.” <br/><br/>With that, Bonnie Maxwell left. <br/><br/>Amelia Miles stood in place, unable to calm down for a long time. <br/><br/>The Clark family, the Clark family, it was actually the Clark family. <br/><br/>How could she be so fortunate to have caught Third Master’s attention? If it was the Clark family, what would she do in the future? She would be completely trampled underfoot and never be able to raise her head again. <br/><br/>No, she can’t let her marry into the Clark family. <br/><br/>Besides... she can’t just focus on John Anderson anymore. John Anderson is not the one. She should look further ahead. <br/><br/>With these thoughts in mind, Amelia Miles suddenly lifted her head and saw the Doomsday Hotel sign. <br/><br/>In the evening, it was particularly dazzling. That was the symbol of Imperial Capital’s nobility. <br/><br/>The Lane family, the young Master Lane... yes, there’s also the Lane family. <br/><br/>If someone like Daisy Zane could cling to the Clark family, she could also win over Young Master Lane’s heart. <br/><br/>The conference hall was empty, and the entrance was gradually crowded with people. Amelia Miles suddenly came to her senses and looked around. No one paid particular attention to her. <br/><br/>She smoothed her hair, took a few breaths, trying her best to remain calm, went back into the conference hall and looked for John Anderson. <br/><br/>On Snack Street, Kevin Clark bought Daisy Zane an ice cream, and the two walked back. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane ate as she walked, with Kevin Clark by her side, helping her watch the road. <br/><br/>“Aren’t you afraid of being caught by someone?” Kevin Clark said. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane took a mask from her seamless skirt pocket and gave it to him: “You put it on.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark took the mask, held it in his hand without putting it on: “What I mean is, in case someone exposes your romance.” <br/><br/>“That’s why you wear the mask,” Daisy Zane said, “I’m afraid people will say I’m keeping a gigolo.” <br/><br/>‘ Kevin Clark pinched her face, “Why are you so cheeky? Do I look like a gigolo?” <br/><br/>“If you were a little uglier, you wouldn’t.” <br/><br/>“...If I were a little uglier, could I still be standing here?” Kevin Clark thoroughly saw through her love for good looks. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane stopped, looked at him, paused for a moment, and said, “Your looks, they should be hereditary, right?” <br/><br/>This sentence directly stunned Kevin Clark, and he looked blank for a while before asking, “What?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane also realized that her question had gone too far, and she blinked. Then she continued walking forward, scraping off a bit of ice cream with her spoon and putting it in her mouth, saying, “It’s nothing.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark subconsciously followed her, walked a few steps, and then silently laughed. <br/><br/>The laughter in his eyes and brows seemed like countless stars, twinkling and carrying endless beauty..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
