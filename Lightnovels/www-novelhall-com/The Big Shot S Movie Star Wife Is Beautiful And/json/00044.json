Then... I also recorded Lilian Lopez looking for the martial arts instructor to make a deal. I—I was too scared, so I didn’t dare record a video; I just recorded the audio.” <br/><br/>Daisy understood what she came for, but still asked, “Tell me why?” <br/><br/>“I think it’s helpful to you.” <br/><br/>“Really?” Daisy said straightly, “Do you think it’s helpful to me, or do you want to get rid of a problem for yourself?” Plunge into the depths of Nøv€lß¡n, where information dwells.<br/><br/>Serena lowered her head and was silent for a while: “Both. But I’m too insignificant, I have nothing, my words carry little weight. Releasing this audio might not even create a ripple. It could also bring about some trouble.” “Then why do you think I would dare? And why would you think I would do it?” <br/><br/>“You definitely dare, and you would definitely do it.” Serena was very sure about this. <br/><br/>Daisy looked at her face and went through all her memories, finding no memory related to this face; she must never have seen her before. <br/><br/>Seeing that she didn’t speak, Serena took out her cell phone, and opened the pitch-black video, placing it on the table. <br/><br/>After a rustling sound, the martial arts instructor’s cursing voice came on. <br/><br/>Then came the sound of Lilian Lopez talking, accompanied by some nervous breathing. The audio was very clear, and it was obvious that it was her voice. This audio was a fatal blow to Lilian Lopez. <br/><br/>There was no need to think about it; now Lilian’s entire team, including Olivia Chester, must be looking for ways to suppress this matter by pulling strings and relying on connections. <br/><br/>Lilian dared to post that Facebook message because she must not have expected any evidence and likely had confidence in finding useful connections; that’s why she dared to post it. <br/><br/>But they couldn’t have imagined that behind them was the Clark Family of Imperial Capital. <br/><br/>Lilian shouldn’t expect to live in peace. <br/><br/>Moreover, even if Arthur North didn’t want to do anything more for the time being, Daisy wouldn’t let it rest. <br/><br/>She never thought of herself as compassionate. <br/><br/>+1f Lilian doesn’t want her to survive in the entertainment industry, the least severe outcome for Lilian would be to disappear from the entertainment industry. <br/><br/>Daisy grinned, “I did hit him.” <br/><br/>“Your strike was too light,” Arthur really wanted to drag the person out and personally waste him. Especially when he heard the cursing in the audio, he felt he had been too lenient. <br/><br/>“I’m a girl, it wouldn’t be good if I hit too hard,” Daisy sat on the back of the sofa. Somehow, she felt happy seeing Arthur like this, “I’m... quite image-conscious.” <br/><br/>Arthur immediately sensed her happiness, hesitated for a moment, and his expression softened, “Your image has always been very good, no matter what.” <br/><br/>He paused and added, “Especially good.” <br/><br/>Daisy lowered her head and laughed. <br/><br/>Arthur looked at the little girl in front of him, who was laughing with her head down, and felt somewhat helpless. After watching for a while, he couldn’t help but raise his hand and rub the top of her head, “Let’s go, to the guesthouse.” <br/><br/>Daisy looked up at him, the corners of her eyes still filled with a fine hint of laughter, and hesitated for a moment. <br/><br/>Arthur was also watching her, although smiling, his eyes were observing her reaction, whether she was repelled or disgusted by this action, and he wasn’t very sure in his heart. <br/><br/>But Daisy just looked at him for a moment and then stood up from the sofa, saying, “I’ll grab a coat.” <br/><br/>As he watched her enter the bedroom, Arthur slowly clenched his hand. It still had the feeling of her hair, and Daisy didn’t show any signs of repulsion. <br/><br/>Thinking of this, Arthur lowered his head, and the corners of his mouth gently curved upwards. <br/><br/>The laughter in his narrow, elongated eyes grew deeper and deeper; with the red corners of his eyes, it was both wicked and intoxicating. <br/><br/>The guesthouse they were staying at was very nice; the town wasn’t very developed, but it had beautiful scenery. <br/><br/>Half of the guesthouse was built on a lake. <br/><br/>There were lotus flowers in the lake which Arthur liked. However, by this season, there were only a few flowers left, and the rest were either leaves or lotus pods. <br/><br/>Upon arriving, Daisy walked along the lake to the guesthouse, “Can these lotus pods be picked?” <br/><br/>“Yes.” Arthur said as he bent down to pick two for Daisy. <br/><br/>Daisy took them, glanced at them, and felt the lotus seeds, “Can they be eaten?” <br/><br/>“Yes,” Arthur laughed, “I’ll peel them for you to try later.” <br/><br/>Xavier, who was following the two of them, heard their conversation and smiled..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
