Her original company was in the Imperial Capital. <br/><br/>As her trend didn’t go down, she exposed her old company, using an even bigger issue to divert public attention. <br/><br/>The decline of an old entertainment company is more eye-catching than her. <br/><br/>“Besides diverting attention, she’s also warning,” Harton Clark said, “warning those who have good relationships with her that if they distance themselves from her in the future, her old company will be an example. She must have a lot of their dark secrets in her hands, enough to make them all fall overnight.” <br/><br/>“That’s ruthless, knowing to keep an ace up her sleeve.” Allonzo Hobson said, “Hey, Arthur, I just got a copy of Daisy Zane’s audition tape, do you want to watch it? My mom just watched it several times and said her Best Actress position is threatened.” <br/><br/>“Send it to me.” <br/><br/>This eager tone made Allonzo Hobson laugh: “Are you going to let me give it to you for free?” <br/><br/>As if he knew what Allonzo Hobson was going to say, Harton Clark’s response was very fast and cold: “A mine in D Continent needs workers to dig...” <br/><br/>“Daddy, I’m sorry, I’ll send it to you right away.” <br/><br/>That night, Harton Clark played the audition video more than a hundred times, until his cell phone shut off. <br/><br/>After Daisy Zane signed a contract with the drama crew, the three days before she joined were spent with Harton Clark and his senior. <br/><br/>She learned all the necessary opera segments in the script. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane was incredibly beautiful, with a great figure and flawless limbs. Moreover, she learned things quickly and had great stamina, never complaining about being tired. Though she seemed unapproachable, she was very respectful and polite. <br/><br/>His senior had a good impression of Daisy Zane after teaching her last time. After spending three days together, she liked her even more. <br/><br/>When leaving, at the airport, she held Daisy Zane’s hand and repeatedly told her to visit Imperial Capital when she had time. <br/><br/>Harton Clark escorted his senior to the boarding gate while Daisy Zane didn’t follow, she and Michael Jackson waited in the car. <br/><br/>In the boarding gate, his senior kept raving: “Arthur, I’m not exaggerating, I’ve seen many young ladies in Imperial Capital, but I’ve never felt anyone was a good match for you. Zane is the only one I think is perfect for you.” <br/><br/>Harton Clark laughed softly. <br/><br/>“We’ve been together these three days, and although she doesn’t talk much, I can feel she’s very knowledgeable. And the calmness on her is not the result of family education, but more like experience,” Senior laughed, “How should I put it? You two are a match made in heaven, both of you giving me a mysterious impression.” Delve into the §ource of thïš dat@, deepl¥ r00ted in n0v(lb¡n★<br/><br/>“Senior, where’s the mystery in me?” <br/><br/>Michael watched her in the rearview mirror, suddenly noticing an unshakable and inescapable deathly stillness around her, as if she was immersed in a pool of blood or a dark abyss, without a trace of light. <br/><br/>Daisy leaned her head back, realizing that she was losing control of herself. <br/><br/>She suddenly opened the car door and got out. <br/><br/>Michael immediately followed her out of the car. Just as he opened the door, he heard Daisy say, “Get in.” <br/><br/>The voice was eerie. <br/><br/>Normally, her voice was just cold, and she was very polite, but these two words carried a profound sense of malice and coldness. <br/><br/>Michael hesitated for a moment: “Lady Zane...” <br/><br/>Daisy slammed the car door shut with a straight arm. <br/><br/>Michael, who was supporting the car door, was pushed back. He gasped from the unexpected pain. <br/><br/>It was noon, and the sunlight outside was good, the sky was very blue, and there wasn’t a single cloud. <br/><br/>Outside the airport was noisy with people coming and going. <br/><br/>But Daisy seemed to not hear anything. She stood outside the car, her face unnaturally pale, and a layer of red gradually appeared in her eyes. She clenched her fists, trying to suppress the impulse in her heart. <br/><br/>Suddenly, a figure appeared in her unfocused eyes, getting closer and clearer. <br/><br/>“What’s wrong?” Kevin Clark asked, worried and anxious. <br/><br/>Daisy’s eyes refocused, and her voice returned to her ears. She looked at Kevin for a while, then slowly lowered her gaze. <br/><br/>Kevin glanced at Michael, who shook his head pitifully, indicating that he had no idea. <br/><br/>“Do you have a cigarette?” Daisy suddenly asked. <br/><br/>Kevin was slightly taken aback, and then searched his pockets, taking out a few pieces of sugar, offering them to Daisy: “I have some sugar, want it?” <br/><br/>Daisy looked at the pink candy in his hand, pursed her lips, hesitated for a moment, and took it. She peeled one off, threw it in her mouth, and chewed right away. <br/><br/>And she chewed through five pieces, making a crisp sound. <br/><br/>Kevin stood next to her, leaning against the car, accompanying her. Seeing her like this, he reached out to Michael and said, “Smoke.” <br/><br/>Michael sat in the car, feeling apprehensive, as if the seat had needles, poking his bottom. Seeing Kevin reach out, he quickly handed over his cigarettes and lighter. <br/><br/>Kevin took one and gave it to Daisy, saying, “This is the only one, and it’s an exception..”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
