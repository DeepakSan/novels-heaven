Even some netizens stuttered and couldn’t say anything nutritious for five minutes.<br/><br/>The Facebook post from Spotlight’s official website was filled with exclamation marks and question marks.<br/><br/>Then, exclamation marks and question marks soon became a trending topic.<br/><br/>Not long after Spotlight’s official website released the news, Felix Baker called Daisy Zane to inform her of the situation regarding the staff member at the company.<br/><br/>The staff member had received a message from a stranger asking her to look at Phoebe Turner’s Facebook page.<br/><br/>Then she found the design draft they had taken before and posted it online.<br/><br/>After all, the company dared to bring out the design draft to show them, which meant they were prepared and wouldn’t let others use it for plagiarism.<br/><br/>So she confidently posted the design draft on Facebook, along with a comparison chart.<br/><br/>As she was in a competitive promotion phase at the time,<br/><br/>She was eager to make a name for herself in the company to seize a promotion opportunity. She didn’t notify the company beforehand and took it upon herself to release the news online.<br/><br/>She intended to use her wits to curry favor with the company later, but it backfired.<br/><br/>Felix Baker briefed her on the situation at the company and asked her how she wanted to handle it.<br/><br/>“Do what needs to be done,” Daisy Zane said, “I have no objection.”<br/><br/>“Deduct her salary and observe her in the company, is that okay?” Felix Baker asked, “Her work ability is not bad. Plus, she is raising a child by herself. If I fire her... I guess two months later, her child will have no milk powder to eat.”<br/><br/>“I said, I have no objection,” Daisy Zane said.<br/><br/>After all, she only pointed out that the work and design draft were highly similar, which could be confirmed as plagiarism.<br/><br/>First, she didn’t intentionally get others to scold her. Secondly, she didn’t intentionally target her.<br/><br/>For Daisy, who was unaware of the situation, she was only stating a fact she believed to be true on the internet.<br/><br/>And it was a stranger who approached her, so she could be considered unlucky.<br/><br/>At most, she violated the company’s internal procedures.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark stood up with her, “Together.”<br/><br/>The two followed the manager to the grand hall, and Amelie Quentin, Hugo Clark, and others followed them as well.<br/><br/>“What are you doing?” Kevin Clark asked with disgust.<br/><br/>“Joining in the fun.” Robinson Scott replied.<br/><br/>Hardy Clark and Amelie Quentin both nodded.<br/><br/>Hugo Clark said, “I follow automatically.”<br/><br/>“Following who?” Kevin Clark suddenly asked him.<br/><br/>Hugo Clark’s eyelashes trembled, and he subconsciously glanced at Amelie Quentin.<br/><br/>Amelie Quentin was sending a message and didn’t notice.<br/><br/>But Kevin Clark saw it. He raised his eyebrows and met Daisy Zane’s eyes when he looked back.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark felt a murderous aura.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn’t say anything and looked away.<br/><br/>When they arrived at the grand hall, Kevin Clark took the package, and Daisy Zane glanced at the delivery guy.<br/><br/>After delivering the package, the delivery guy left.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark checked the express order, and the shipping address was for another hotel.<br/><br/>“What is it?” Robinson Scott asked, “Is it safe?”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark held it in his hand, “With this weight... it’s definitely not a bomb.”<br/><br/>Robinson Scott:<br/><br/>“I hope it’s not something sent by the fans.” Hardy Clark said, “They know auntie is attending a birthday banquet here.”<br/><br/>Amelie Quentin furrowed her brow, “Who dares to send it here?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane: “Let’s open it.”<br/><br/>The lobby manager found a small knife used to open express boxes, and Kevin Clark directly opened the box at the front desk.<br/><br/>Like a box of Russian dolls, there was another layer inside when one layer was opened, and then another.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane suspected that someone was messing with her.<br/><br/>Finally, after the last box was opened, there was a black plastic bag wrapped in bubble wrap, with a layer of tape wrapped around the outside.<br/><br/>Hugo Clark, fearing something inappropriate inside, shielded Hardy Clark and Amelie Quentin with his body.<br/><br/>Then two little heads appeared on either side of Hugo Clark, covering their eyes, scared yet curious.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark used the knife to cut open the plastic bag and bubble wrap directly.<br/><br/>Finally, the contents inside were revealed.<br/><br/>A sealed bag with three sealing bottles inside.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark immediately took them out to look, and through the sealed bag, everyone clearly saw the words on the sealing bottles: 319 (ii).\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
