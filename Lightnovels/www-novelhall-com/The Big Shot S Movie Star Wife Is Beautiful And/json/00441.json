Kevin Clark couldn’t bear to do it, unable to make the move.<br/><br/>But Daisy Zane insisted on forcing him to make the move.<br/><br/>So the two continued to be in a stalemate.<br/><br/>The specific manifestation was... Daisy Zane could not hear what Kevin Clark was saying.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane had always been in the hospital accompanying Kevin Clark, and they had a very harmonious relationship, except... Daisy Zane did not respond to every word Kevin Clark said.<br/><br/>Yoshua Archer and Edward Darkmoon came to report their work, and they watched their big boss say a word to Martin Hanzel with wide eyes.<br/><br/>Martin Hanzel seemed not to hear it and didn’t react at all, just lowered his head and carved a flower on an apple with a knife.<br/><br/>Because of her lack of response, both Yoshua and Edward’s hearts jumped into their throats.<br/><br/>They were afraid that their big boss would immediately give her a beating until she listened properly.<br/><br/>However, they saw Kevin Clark silently bearing the cold violence, not even daring to breathe.<br/><br/>So after Yoshua and Edward left, the two brothers remained silent for a while. Yoshua said, “Is marrying a wife so scary?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know, but it looks like it. When have you ever seen our big boss so aggrieved.”<br/><br/>“It’s so terrifying, I don’t want to get married.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane hooked her hand around the belt on Kevin Clark’s sleeping robe and pulled him forward, “Injured man, can you handle it with your body?”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark squinted his eyes and chuckled after a moment.<br/><br/>With this soft laughter, Daisy Zane seemed to envision her own “miserable condition” in the next few hours.<br/><br/>When Kevin Clark walked in front of her, intending to pick her up, she immediately grabbed his wrist: “The doctor said you need to rest.”<br/><br/>“It won’t affect me.” Kevin Clark smiled.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at the plaster cast in his left sleeve and promptly stopped him: “...I meant trying hypnosis.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark pretended not to hear and insisted on picking up Daisy Zane.<br/><br/>But Daisy Zane held on to his right wrist and did not let go: “Two options, either try hypnosis or go to sleep now.”<br/><br/>“I want to choose the third one.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at him.<br/><br/>As the two looked at each other for a while, Kevin Clark finally compromised and reluctantly spat out two words: “Sleep. But can I carry you back to bed?”<br/><br/>A powerful man shows weakness to you.<br/><br/>A powerful, good-looking man shows weakness to you.<br/><br/>A powerful, good-looking man with a good voice shows weakness to you.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane hesitated for a second and then raised her hand to hug his neck. Kevin Clark placed his right hand under her knees and picked her up.<br/><br/>He kissed her on the tip of her nose and then carried her to the bed.<br/><br/>As the two lay in bed, Kevin Clark held her in his arms, letting her pillow on his right arm, and gently patting her back with his left arm.<br/><br/>Since returning to their home country from Hadson the last time, the two had not snuggled together and slept for a long time.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
