The theme was “a gathering of friends with musical instruments, chess, calligraphy, and painting.” <br/><br/>The scene was filled with ancient musical instruments, chess games, pen and ink stones, and paintings. <br/><br/>In addition to appreciating the decorations, guests could also create impromptu works and learn from one another. <br/><br/>Everywhere was filled with cultural heritage, poetic and picturesque charm, and refined elegance. <br/><br/>Many reporters gathered at the entrance, eagerly waiting for the arrival of various superstars. In attendance were not only domestic celebrities but also many foreign celebrities. <br/><br/>The major media outlets by the door were all vying for a headline. <br/><br/>Since the main entrance was surrounded by media, it was left for the celebrities. Others entered the conference hall through the side door. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane also had several invitations, so she invited Hill Dawson and Anisa Cooper to Imperial Capital to attend together. <br/><br/>However, the two had selected a skirt for Daisy Zane at the villa for three hours, intending for her to shine in front of the media, yet she entered the conference hall through the side door with Arthur North. <br/><br/>The two didn’t dare to argue loudly and whispered behind her all the way. <br/><br/>Today, Daisy Zane wore an ice-blue long skirt from her wardrobe. <br/><br/>The skirt reached down to her ankles, creating a great sense of fluidity and a cool, ethereal feeling. The sleeves were made of ice-blue gauze netting, extending to the back of her hands, giving off a fairy-like aura. <br/><br/>The neckline was a V-shape, not too deep, and just right. <br/><br/>Simple and sexy, with a hint of coolness beneath the sexiness. <br/><br/>Everything was just right. <br/><br/>There were no additional adornments in her hair, only an ice-blue hairpin. <br/><br/>The front of her hair was parted in three-sevens, with a slight curvature at the ends. It looked a bit messy and lazy. <br/><br/>In keeping with her clothes, she wore silver earrings. <br/><br/>Her makeup was light as well. <br/><br/>Regardless, her overall style was cool and laid-back. <br/><br/>No matter what, it would not diminish her inherent stunning beauty. The colder she looked, the more stunning and more difficult it was for people to look away from her. <br/><br/>Daisy’s own heroic spirit was fully displayed. nove(l)bi(n.)com<br/><br/>The skirt didn’t weaken her sharp charm; it was more like her battle-wear that enhanced it. <br/><br/>In order to complement Daisy Zane’s cool and laid-back style, Arthur North also wore a white shirt in the same style. The color of the cufflinks was the same as Daisy Zane’s skirt. However, Third Master’s temperament and looks could not be toned down just by wearing a white shirt. <br/><br/>The sense of enchantment within his eyes only became more pronounced when set against the white shirt. <br/><br/>The combination of ancient elegance and enchantment was most captivating. <br/><br/>“Let’s wait until the press conference is over.” Daisy said softly, “So as not to disturb his work.” <br/><br/>“Alright. My brother will come down later anyway,” Austin said. “Okay, I’m going to help entertain the guests. Let me know if you need anything.” <br/><br/>“Okay.” <br/><br/>When Austin left, both Hill and Anisa came over and looked at her together: <br/><br/>“You also know Joseph Allen!” <br/><br/>“We have some acquaintance.” <br/><br/>“You sure have a wide circle of friends.” Hill walked back and forth in front of her, then suddenly leaned closer and asked, “Can you get an endorsement deal?” <br/><br/>Daisy tilted her head back a bit: ‘ <br/><br/>Anisa suddenly laughed out loud. <br/><br/>“Is there any chance?” Hill’s eyes were sparkling. <br/><br/>Hill’s eyes lost their sparkle instantly. It was as if the vast galaxy had suddenly lost power. <br/><br/>Daisy gave Anisa a look, and Anisa immediately led Hill away: “Sister Emily, introduce me to some more people.” <br/><br/>After the two of them left, Daisy looked at the chessboard again, thought about it, and made a move. <br/><br/>Only then did she look at Kevin, who had been watching her. <br/><br/>Kevin gazed at her, then said after a moment, “Little girl, the one who first called you ‘Lucia,’ it wasn’t Joseph Allen, was it?” <br/><br/>“Mhm.” <br/><br/>Seeing her respond so readily, Kevin was stunned for a moment and then gently hooked her chin, “Saying it so quickly, don’t you worry I’ll be angry.” <br/><br/>“What’s there to be angry about?” Daisy glanced at him, then back at the chessboard, and casually said, “Your move.” <br/><br/>Kevin: <br/><br/>Seeing that he was not moving, Daisy looked at him again. <br/><br/>As her gaze met his cool eyes, Kevin coughed lightly, picked up a chess piece, absentmindedly looked at the board for a while, and then put it down. <br/><br/>His pale fingers, pinching the black piece, fell on the board as if in a delicate painting. <br/><br/>Daisy’s gaze moved away from his fingertips and surveyed the board, the corners of her mouth lifting slightly. <br/><br/>With the fall of the white piece, the black pieces were defeated. <br/><br/>“Third Master, you lost.” Daisy looked at him, lightly raising an eyebrow. <br/><br/>Kevin looked at her smug expression hidden beneath her exterior and narrowed his eyes: “You did it on purpose, messing with my mindset.” <br/><br/>Daisy’s laughter deepened, “This is war is deceit.” <br/><br/>. Naughty girl.” Kevin tapped her nose, “What war is deceit? You’re just bullying me. And you even enjoy it.’ <br/><br/>Daisy looked at his helpless expression, and after a moment, she turned her head slightly and began to laugh softly....\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
