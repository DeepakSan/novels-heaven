Juan clenched his teeth and muttered, “What a great actress she is, she sounds so sincere Why isn’t she in the entertainment industry?” <br/><br/>“Bonnie Maxwell ” <br/><br/>As soon as Hardy Clark uttered these three words, Natalie Wayne smashed the teacup in her own hand. <br/><br/>The teacup shattered accompanied by a sharp sound, causing the entire tea room to become silent. <br/><br/>Hardy and Calvin Stewart shivered in fright. <br/><br/>Charles Amos was also startled. <br/><br/>Arthur North raised his eyebrows and then gently patted Daisy Zane’s head. <br/><br/>Charles looked at them and also wanted to be patted on the head, but no one looked at him, so he patted his own head. <br/><br/>In the room aside from Elina Clark, it seemed that nobody had ever seen Natalie Wayne lose her temper like this. <br/><br/>Bonnie was also startled at first but recovered quickly. The corner of her mouth twitched as she looked like she was ready to watch a good show, waiting to see how Natalie would scold Daisy. <br/><br/>Natalie looked at the two tea masters and said, “Leave.” <br/><br/>The two tea masters hesitated but glanced at Bonnie and left the room. <br/><br/>Daisy looked at her and asked, “So Miss Maxwell wanted to help me, is that right?” <br/><br/>“Of course.” Bonnie looked at her, but her smile seemed twisted at the bottom of her eyes. “Your reputation is related to the Clark Family, so naturally, I can’t just stand by and do nothing.” <br/><br/>“Is that so?” Daisy’s mouth curved upward, but there was no trace of a smile in her eyes. “Miss Maxwell has joined Celestial Pivot, and her hacking skills must be excellent. I wonder if she has ever attacked Celestial Pivot’s defense system?” <br/><br/>All of the Clark Family members turned to look at Daisy. <br/><br/>Only Charles continued eating. <br/><br/>Excitement faintly appeared on Juan’s face. <br/><br/>“Why are you asking this?” Bonnie didn’t know why Daisy suddenly brought this up. <br/><br/>“I saw Miss Maxwell join Celestial Pivot and seemed very proud. I thought Miss Maxwell had broken through Celestial Pivot’s defense system,” Daisy said softly. “Holt Lawrence, one of the founders, has never been so smug.” <br/><br/>Arthur’s eyelashes blinked gently. The little girl had met Holt Lawrence <br/><br/>He hadn’t even met him. <br/><br/>Bonnie raised her chin and said, “Although I haven’t broken through Celestial Pivot’s defense system, I can crack 59% of it. People will always keep progressing, and there will eventually be a time when they succeed.” <br/><br/>“59% ” Daisy patted Charles’s head lightly. “Where did you break through last time?” <br/><br/>“67%,” Charles said, putting a pistachio Arthur had peeled into his mouth. <br/><br/>Arthur North: <br/><br/>Juan Wright: “!!!!!” (When did this happen!? He only taught Charles the basics, not such profound skills.)\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
