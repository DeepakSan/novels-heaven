Dad, look, there are so many media and fans at the hotel entrance. It says Daisy Zane’s name on it.”<br/><br/>Johanes Miles and Old Master Miles were sitting inside the coffee shop across from the hotel, watching the hotel.<br/><br/>“Dad, live stream.” Lorenzo Jasper finally entered the live stream room, but he was kicked out three times.<br/><br/>Both of them focused on the live stream content.<br/><br/>After watching for a while, Lorenzo Jasper said, “Dad, we can also watch this at home. We can’t get in here anyway.”<br/><br/>“We can’t get in, but they will come out eventually.” Old Master Miles said.<br/><br/>Lorenzo Jasper said, “Dad, are you thinking of ”<br/><br/>“With so many media at the entrance, it’s easy to do anything.” Old Master Miles said solemnly, “If she’s innocent, we’ll use the media to bring her back to the Miles Family. If she isn’t, we’ll use the media to step on her and win some fame.”<br/><br/>Lorenzo Jasper looked at his father.<br/><br/>Old Master Miles watched the live stream and said, “No matter what, our trip here will be beneficial one way or another.”<br/><br/>“Mm.” Lorenzo Jasper continued watching the live stream.<br/><br/>At the press conference, after playing the surveillance video, Daisy Zane turned to the man named Jeremy Wheeler and said, “You’ve been with me for six years, so you must know my family’s situation very well, right?”<br/><br/>Jeremy Wheeler took his eyes off the screen, still not understanding the reason for her playing the video. Hearing her question, he answered, “Of course, who knows you better than me?”<br/><br/>“You must also be very clear about how many people are in my family, right?”<br/><br/>“Of course.” Jeremy Wheeler said in awkward Mandarin, “It’s only you and your grandma at home, and we’re taking care of her together.”<br/><br/>After he finished speaking, Daisy Zane didn’t say anything, just lowered her head to find another video to play.<br/><br/>It was a video Daisy Zane took with a real camera.<br/><br/>And to commemorate that day, she specifically set the date.<br/><br/>It was four years ago, in January, before the New Year, when Shopie Easton returned to Cold Green Village and cleaned the house with Daisy Zane before the New Year.<br/><br/>[This man is obviously a liar. He has too many loopholes.]<br/><br/>[Lucia must be innocent. It’s you crazy people who just throw dirt on someone with any little piece of news.]<br/><br/>[Without any evidence, you just slander a woman’s innocence. Your hearts are black.]<br/><br/>[May those who often expose others on the internet also experience being exposed.]<br/><br/>[I’d better not say anything. The direction of this is a bit confusing.]<br/><br/>Jeremy Wheeler looked at the reporters offstage, his eyelashes trembling slightly, and then said: “Lucia, you, you can’t turn your back on me. I’m not talking nonsense. Are all those years of our relationship fake? If it’s fake, how would I know the current room arrangement? In my memory, the room arrangement is just like this. Your video can only prove that the arrangement was like this on that day, and it can’t prove it stayed like that afterward.”<br/><br/>Daisy looked at him.<br/><br/>He was not stupid at all. It was only because he didn’t have much experience and didn’t know much about the outside world that Harton Clark’s people managed to deceive him.<br/><br/>Otherwise, his reaction speed alone would make it difficult to fool him.<br/><br/>“The room was only arranged like this three years ago, and after it was arranged, I left Cold Green Village.” Daisy said, “Besides the arrangement, you have too many loopholes. And you emphasize the arrangement of Cold Green Village too much, which is the biggest problem.”<br/><br/>The more one wants to be true, the more detailed one speaks.<br/><br/>It was precisely because of this that Daisy was able to use the related evidence to prove her innocence.<br/><br/>Jeremy Wheeler wanted to speak again, but Daisy interrupted him: “I do have evidence for why you know the current appearance of Cold Green Village.”<br/><br/>Daisy played another surveillance video.<br/><br/>“You should be familiar with this date.” Daisy tapped her fingers on the table and said, “Not long after this day, someone took you away from Cold Green Village.”<br/><br/>When her words were finished, the surveillance video that originally showed the static image of a room suddenly had the door pushed open.<br/><br/>Three men entered.<br/><br/>These three people rummaged in the room for a while, checking almost every corner.<br/><br/>Before leaving, they even took detailed photos of the room.<br/><br/>The person at the door, seeing the surveillance video, immediately wanted to leave.<br/><br/>But as he turned and walked away, he was stopped and forced back.<br/><br/>Someone was blocking the doorway.<br/><br/>Daisy looked at the door and said, “To the person at the door since you’re here, why are you in such a hurry to leave?”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
