Edward Kirsten and Alice Eugene left.Rread latest chapters at novelhall.com<br/><br/>On the way, Alice Eugene kept looking back at Edward Kirsten.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Edward Kirsten was watching “Fall of the Quince.”<br/><br/>During dinner, he asked Alice Eugene to buy a tablet, logged in with Stella Edwards’ mobile number, and also opened a five-year membership.<br/><br/>It was downloaded using the restaurant’s network.<br/><br/>Then Edward Kirsten kept watching the tablet, looking at the familiar yet somewhat unfamiliar people on the screen.<br/><br/>When Alice Eugene looked back at him for the Nth time, Edward Kirsten said without looking away from the tablet, “Speak.”<br/><br/>Alice Eugene looked at the road ahead, pursed her lips, and said softly, “Enigma used Daisy’s identity. They ”<br/><br/>“Cold Green Village is located in a coastal province,” Edward Kirsten said lightly, “There’s a high chance Enigma entered that province when she came from Continent A.”<br/><br/>“Did they know each other at that time?”<br/><br/>“Speculation.”<br/><br/>“Back then, when we sent people to look for Clara, they mysteriously lost contact,” Alice Eugene said, “We sent people to Cold Green Village later on. We saw two tombstones on the mountain top. We thought they were dead.”<br/><br/>Edward Kirsten looked at the tablet and smirked, “Indeed, they are dead. It’s just that Enigma is living on behalf of Daisy.”<br/><br/>“Things have become simpler,” Edward Kirsten smiled, “As long as we bring Enigma back, there’s hope to find what we want.”<br/><br/>“Will she... know?”<br/><br/>“She’s the only hope now.”<br/><br/>Alice Eugene pressed her lips together and said nothing more.<br/><br/>Edward Kirsten didn’t talk either, looking down to continue watching the show. His eyes revealed a smile unintentionally.<br/><br/>At Cold Green Village, Daisy and Kevin Clark came down from the mountain, ate, packed their things, and headed back. When it got dark, they arrived at the airport. Without stopping, they boarded the airplane and flew back to Imperial Capital.<br/><br/>The time they arrived at the Imperial Capital wasn’t late. After having dinner at Doomsday Hotel, both of them went back to Rose Garden.<br/><br/>Upon returning, Kevin Clark took a shower and lay down with Daisy. After she fell asleep, he carefully got out of bed again<br/><br/>“What are you going to do?”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark heard the voice, paused, and looked back at Daisy. Bending over, he kissed her face, “There’s some work to handle, sleep.”<br/><br/>For a moment, no one spoke, and it felt as if the air itself had solidified.<br/><br/>It was Juan who broke the silence, as he approached Natalie with a respectful bow. “Madam, Sister.”<br/><br/>His words prompted a reaction from Natalie and Daisy.<br/><br/>Natalie was the first to show a polite smile and adjusted her hair.<br/><br/>Daisy also grasped her slightly disheveled hair and descended the staircase.<br/><br/>“Daisy, I see you here,” Natalie greeted gently as she walked in, her face full of warmth and kindness.<br/><br/>Daisy approached her, hesitated, and chose a form of address: “Madam, Senior Sister.”<br/><br/>Jane responded with a smile.<br/><br/>Natalie looked at Daisy. Despite wearing pajamas and having messy hair, she was still stunning and exceptionally attractive with her cold and detached demeanor. Sensing her discomfort, Natalie advised, “Don’t call me madam; just call me aunt.”<br/><br/>Daisy gently rubbed her fingertips together and softly assented.<br/><br/>“Did you just wake up?” Natalie asked warmly.<br/><br/>“I’ve been up for a while,” Daisy replied, glancing at the living room clock. It was already 9:30.<br/><br/>Her voice remained calm, slightly cold, but it was not hard to detect the respect in her words as well as a hint of barely perceptible awkwardness.<br/><br/>“Haven’t you had breakfast yet? Where’s Arthur? Isn’t he here?” Natalie looked around and exclaimed, “He’s not even feeding you breakfast?!”<br/><br/>Daisy:<br/><br/>“Madam, Third Master has some matters to attend to,” Juan explained. “He asked me to buy breakfast. Would you and Sister Jane like to join us?”<br/><br/>“What’s he busy with all day long? Can’t he even find time for breakfast with his wife?!” Natalie grumbled, and then she took Daisy’s hand with a smile, “Auntie will have breakfast with you.”<br/><br/>Natalie led Daisy towards the dining room while explaining, “I didn’t know you were living here. Arthur usually goes to the Clark Manor when he’s not around. Today, I wanted to bring Jane along to dig up some rose bushes. Auntie didn’t bring anything for you, but I’ll make it up to you next time.”<br/><br/>Daisy handed the flash drive to Juan, and then glanced at Natalie, who was still holding her hand. Her fingertips stirred slightly but eventually let her continue holding her hand. “You’re too kind.”<br/><br/>Juan looked at the flash drive in his hand and, though not knowing its contents, held it like a precious treasure.<br/><br/>Natalie chuckled and asked, “Do you have some time later?”<br/><br/>Daisy pushed her errands back a bit and replied, “Mhm.”<br/><br/>“Great. We’re going shopping later, why don’t you join us?”<br/><br/>Jane Chester chimed in, “That’s a great idea, let’s all go together.”<br/><br/>Daisy managed to reply without any change in her expression, “Alright.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
