It was as if every pore on her body was bearing the pressure and coldness from Daisy Zane. This material is rooted in n0velbin★<br/><br/>\"You, you...\" <br/><br/>The streetlamps at school were bright, driving away the darkness. But Clarissa felt as if she was surrounded by darkness. <br/><br/>At that moment, voices suddenly sounded from a distance. <br/><br/>\"Is that Clarissa? It looks like her.\" <br/><br/>\"Yeah, she's a student in the Sophomore Performance Department, it must be her.\" <br/><br/>\"Ah—— I can't believe I met the goddess. If I go say hi, will I disturb her too much?\" <br/><br/>\"No, Clarissa is really nice and gentle.\" <br/><br/>\"I'll take a few photos first.\" <br/><br/>... <br/><br/>These voices snapped Clarissa back to her senses. <br/><br/>It felt like escaping from the enormous shadow of Daisy Zane. <br/><br/>It was at school, with so many people and surveillance. What could she do? What was there to be scared of? <br/><br/>Moreover, her fans were present as well. Even if this person caused her any trouble, her fans would help her out. Maybe she could even gain some sympathy and attention in the process. <br/><br/>Clarissa forced herself to calm down and retorted somewhat weakly: \"Don't scare me. I won't be afraid!\" <br/><br/>Hearing footsteps approaching, Daisy Zane's impulse was suppressed as well. She lowered her eyes, pinched her fingertips, and whispered, \"Speak less, and stay alive. Understand?\" <br/><br/>The voice was soft, but it was chillingly fierce. <br/><br/>Standing close together, Clarissa held her breath and clenched her hands tightly. For a moment, it felt like the person in front of her could take her life. <br/><br/>\"Clar—Clarissa...\" A timid and shy voice sounded. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn't linger, turning around and leaving. <br/><br/>Only after a few female students called out a few more times did Clarissa regain her senses, hastily turning to feign a smile. <br/><br/>The girls immediately expressed concern: \"Clarissa, are you alright? Are you feeling unwell?\" <br/><br/>He said a few words to the person on the other end of the phone, hung up, then turned to face Daisy. <br/><br/>\"I didn't realize I lived so close to Lady Zane.\" <br/><br/>Daisy straightened her body, tucking the wind-blown loose strands of hair behind her ear, and arched an eyebrow at the sound of his voice. <br/><br/>Ever since the night Kevin had escorted her home, she had suspected that he might be living in Everlasting Palace. <br/><br/>But she hadn't expected it to be such a coincidence. <br/><br/>\"You're not asleep yet?\" Kevin glanced at the wine in her hand. <br/><br/>\"I can't sleep.\" Daisy lifted the glass, \"Do you want to drink some?\" <br/><br/>Kevin's eyes always seemed to carry a smile when he looked at Daisy. Upon hearing her question, he hesitated before saying, \"Is it convenient at this late hour?\" <br/><br/>A hint of amusement tinted the corners of Daisy's eyes as she said, \"It's not late. A new day has just begun.\" <br/><br/>\"So... should I come over?\" <br/><br/>\"Mhm.\" <br/><br/>It was only when Kevin pressed the doorbell that he realized he might have been a bit impulsive. <br/><br/>Knocking on a young lady's door at this late hour... it wasn't quite gentlemanly behavior. <br/><br/>But... oh well, he couldn't care too much about that now. <br/><br/>Daisy opened the door, now wearing home clothes. She stepped aside to let Kevin in, grabbed a pair of large disposable slippers from the shoe cabinet, and said, \"Make do with these.\" <br/><br/>Kevin glanced at her shoe cabinet, filled with women's shoes, and bent down to change his shoes, saying, \"Thank you.\" <br/><br/>Daisy walked towards the kitchen, asking, \"What kind of wine would you like?\" <br/><br/>\"You have every kind?\" <br/><br/>\"More or less.\" <br/><br/>Kevin was slightly surprised by her response. He walked into the living room and said, \"Whatever you like, I'm fine with anything.\" <br/><br/>Daisy casually grabbed a bottle of red wine and placed it with two wine glasses on the living room tea table, saying, \"Feel free to sit down and make yourself at home.\" <br/><br/>Kevin sat on the sofa and glanced at the bottle of wine. <br/><br/>A seven-figure-priced wine. <br/><br/>Daisy used a corkscrew with ease and familiarity to open the wine, pouring a glass for him before filling her own, commenting, \"It's not bad.\" <br/><br/>Her sitting posture was formal, but her actions were brisk. <br/><br/>Kevin took a small sip and asked, \"How's your alcohol tolerance?\" <br/><br/>\"Quite good,\" Daisy replied, her phoenix eyes teasing, adding, \"Good enough to invite an unfamiliar man into my home for a drink.\" <br/><br/>Kevin laughed, his lips as red as cinnabar, all the more enticing, \"It seems I don't have a good image in Lady Zane's heart.\" <br/><br/>\"Yeah, Third Master's reputation isn't the best.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
