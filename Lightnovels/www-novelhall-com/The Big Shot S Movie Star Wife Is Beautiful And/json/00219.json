But you also promised me safety first. Remember?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane understood that he was talking about her decision to charge ahead without knowing if there were any partition rooms in the corridor.

Safety first, you hear me?” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark knew his boundaries when he had spoken to her about these things before they were together. <br/><br/>He remembered very clearly that Daisy Zane said she would not risk her life before her task was completed. <br/><br/>He hadn’t said anything back then. <br/><br/>But now that they were together, he could say these things. <br/><br/>“Mmhmm.” Daisy Zane responded softly. <br/><br/>In the past, nobody dared to disobey her orders. Logan and the others could only obey. <br/><br/>But now it was different; there was Kevin Clark. Even if she did not consider her own well-being, betting on it, she could not ignore Kevin Clark. <br/><br/>She couldn’t ignore that Kevin Clark used his own body to bear the other fifty percent of uncertainty. <br/><br/>Seeing her agree, Kevin Clark’s expression instantly softened, and his voice followed suit, “The renowned Nameless of the Darknight Alliance made a promise, you must keep it.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane: . ” What a flowery language. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark laughed and, touching her hair, asked, “Are you hungry?” <br/><br/>“A little.” <br/><br/>“Do you want to go out to eat or... should I make something?” <br/><br/>“Is there any good food outside?” <br/><br/>Seeing her not speaking, Kevin Clark gave her shoulder another peck on the right. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s body trembled involuntarily. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark laughed and then kissed her collarbone’s scar: “Taking advantage two times more.” <br/><br/>“You talk too much.” Daisy Zane looked down at the scar in his palm, which had faded a lot. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark pinched her reddened earlobe and said, “Change your clothes. I’ll leave now.” <br/><br/>After saying that, he left. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane sat on the washbasin. After two seconds, she raised her hand to touch her shoulder, then got off the washbasin, opened the door, and went out. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark was putting on his shoes beside the bed. Daisy Zane leaned against the restroom wall and said leisurely, “Third Master, there are many empty rooms on the third floor. <br/><br/>“Huh?” Kevin Clark looked at her. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised her eyebrows, “Just pick one and take care of it.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s expression darkened. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s smile was a bit mischievous, and she spoke slowly, “I’ll give you ten minutes.” <br/><br/>Her voice was calm, but it was clear that she emphasized the “ten minutes.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark gritted his teeth and walked towards her. <br/><br/>Seeing him coming, Daisy Zane left him with a provocative look. She immediately returned to the restroom and locked the door from inside. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark stopped in his tracks, listening to the sound of the lock, and pressed his brow. <br/><br/>He should have known that this little girl wouldn’t just suffer without fighting back. This was true retaliation, provocation, and a personal attack. <br/><br/>After Daisy Zane had changed her clothes, the two went out directly. <br/><br/>As they were going out, both Liana Butch and James Collins were nowhere to be found. <br/><br/>They did bump into a few night patrollers, but they just stopped in their tracks and nodded to Daisy Zane without saying a word. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s car was outside, and the two went out of the manor house. After getting in the car, Kevin Clark said, “How did you meet Logan?” Daisy Zane buckled her seat belt and replied, “We had a fight, and she lost to me.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark lifted the corner of his mouth, “After dinner, go stay at my place. Let James Collins come too.” <br/><br/>“Huh?” <br/><br/>“This place is the resting place for the Hundred Demons Pavilion in M Continent. ” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at him. <br/><br/>“Hundred Demons Pavilion has too many enemies, and this place could be attacked at any time,” <br/><br/>“It can’t be attacked.” Daisy Zane said indifferently. <br/><br/>“Indeed, it can’t be attacked.” Kevin Clark looked at the road ahead, “But the people of the Hundred Demons Pavilion would make the manor house entrance full of corpses. It’s too bloody and not quiet, not suitable for living..”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
