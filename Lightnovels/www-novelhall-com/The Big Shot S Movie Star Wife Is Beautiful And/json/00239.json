His once proud back slumped, looking utterly defeated. <br/><br/>What kind of people dared to talk to him like that. <br/><br/>Just because they designed better clothes, they think they’re so great. <br/><br/>If it weren’t for that woman’s liking, this kind of person, selling clothes, wouldn’t be worthy of carrying his shoes. <br/><br/>They dare to belittle him. <br/><br/>That Ninevara Flynn acted so aloof. Just a stinking woman who relies on men to get where she is! <br/><br/>Billy Allen strode forward, and after walking a distance, he suddenly stopped. <br/><br/>His chest heaving violently, gasping for breath. The hair held by hair gel had also fallen down. <br/><br/>He clenched his hands, his eyes bloodshot. The humiliation written all over his face... <br/><br/>But if he couldn’t get the job done, he couldn’t go back; he couldn’t report back. <br/><br/>Where would he find Shopie Easton again if he left tonight? <br/><br/>Go to Cloud Attire Rainbow Skirt Building? He probably wouldn’t even get to see Joseph Allen. <br/><br/>Standing still, Billy Allen took a deep breath, raising both hands to wipe his face and turned back. <br/><br/>But as soon as he walked to a weight-bearing pillar, he caught a glimpse of a figure in the corner of his eye. <br/><br/>His eyes saw it before his brain could react. He was pulled behind the weight-bearing pillar. <br/><br/>Two minutes later, Daisy Zane emerged from the shadows of the parking lot. She wore a black suit jacket over her skirt and a mask on her face. Folloow current novÊls on nov/3lb((in).(co/m)<br/><br/>As she walked back, she wiped the bloodstains on her fingers with a handkerchief from her suit pocket. <br/><br/>Before she came, Kevin Clark gave her the mask. The suit jacket belonged to George Dunn. <br/><br/>Reaching the end of a row of parking spaces, Daisy Zane lowered her head to wipe her hands and turned right. <br/><br/>In another direction, two men happened to walk by. <br/><br/>They barely caught a glimpse of Daisy Zane’s retreating figure. <br/><br/>The man in front wore a black haute couture suit, tall and slender. His eyes were clean and noble, with slightly upturned corners. His pale pink lips slightly pursed. <br/><br/>At first glance, the man looked extremely handsome, clean and mature, with a <br/><br/>gentle and refined temperament. <br/><br/>But upon closer inspection, one would find that there seemed to be an unresolved worry between his brows. <br/><br/>He suddenly was not sure whether his own people had gotten involved or not. <br/><br/>“We didn’t beat him up,” said another person. “It was...it was...Third Master’s wife...who was particularly cruel with her hands. Obviously, she had been trained. We were just responsible for handling the aftermath of her strike.” William Lane was silent for two seconds and then chuckled lightly. He let them take the person away. <br/><br/>Looking at their retreating figures, he thought, “What kind of godly character did Kevin Clark find?” <br/><br/>He vaguely remembered that Allonzo Hobson seemed to have mentioned in their group chat. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s girlfriend is a formidable character. <br/><br/>Formidable enough to be beyond the imagination of all of them. <br/><br/>Looking at this...could it be that he has found a tigress? <br/><br/>Anyway, who could tame Kevin Clark if not someone extraordinary. <br/><br/>While thinking so, a light and quick sound of footsteps suddenly entered William Lane’s ears. <br/><br/>William Lane lowered his eyes and chuckled lightly. <br/><br/>However, the assistant next to him looked in the direction of the sound but did not speak or move. <br/><br/>A few seconds later, William Lane’s eyes were covered from the back. <br/><br/>Olivia Lane’s voice sounded, asking, “Tell me, who is the most beautiful woman in the world?” <br/><br/>William Lane held her hand, pulling it down from his eyes, “Of course, it’s our gentle and beautiful mother. What’s the matter? Do you want to rebel?” <br/><br/>“I wouldn’t dare.” <br/><br/>William Lane turned around, stretched out his finger, touched her forehead gently, and said softly, “Done playing? You’re back?” <br/><br/>“Yeah.” Olivia Lane hugged his arm, “Brother, where are you going to stay tonight? Home?” <br/><br/>“Mom and Dad are at home, of course, I have to spend the night there.” William Lane, with one arm hugged by her, continued walking forward. <br/><br/>“Oh, you’re going back. When will you find me a sister-in-law?” Olivia Lane said, “Kevin Clark is a year younger than you, and he already has a girlfriend.” <br/><br/>“Kevin Clark, Kevin Clark. You’re really disrespectful.” <br/><br/>“You also call him by his name.” <br/><br/>“I’m older than him,” William Lane smiled. <br/><br/>“You still have the nerve to say it.” Olivia Lane pouted, “Is it an honor to be one year older?” <br/><br/>William Lane chuckled, “Did you also meet Kevin Clark’s girlfriend?” <br/><br/>“Yes. That day, we went to the Orchard Garden and happened to meet her.” <br/><br/>“How is she?” <br/><br/>“Hmm...quite beautiful.” <br/><br/>William Lane raised his eyebrows. It must be very beautiful for his sister to say the word beautiful. <br/><br/>Olivia Lane thought about it and said, “She also loves to meddle in other people’s business.” <br/><br/>William Lane looked at her again.. What kind of evaluation was this?\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
