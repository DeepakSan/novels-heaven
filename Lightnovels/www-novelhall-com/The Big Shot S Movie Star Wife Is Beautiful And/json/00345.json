Arthur nodded to signal that they should continue their work and not worry about him.<br/><br/>Allonzo Hobson raised an eyebrow and looked at the two of them with a playfully lascivious smile, “Arthur, you two standing together Brook Sister looks like a minor.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane:<br/><br/>Arthur North looked at him, his voice floating lightly, “Keep looking, and I’ll gouge your eyes out.”<br/><br/>Allonzo Hobson shivered in fright and coughed lightly, not joking anymore.<br/><br/>George Dunn stood up and said, “Third Master.”<br/><br/>Arthur North nodded.<br/><br/>Turner Daniel also stood up, looked at Arthur North and then at Daisy Zane, and smiled, “Daisy, this is ”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at him and introduced in a soft voice, “Boyfriend.”<br/><br/>Turner Daniel’s hand, which was hanging by his side, tightened.<br/><br/>“One of the people recording the show with me. Turner Daniel.” Daisy Zane introduced to Arthur North.<br/><br/>Turner Daniel might have been young, so any concerns were clearly visible on his face.<br/><br/>Allonzo Hobson, George Dunn, and Arthur North quickly noticed.<br/><br/>Arthur North looked at him without speaking, but thought to himself: There really are love rivals everywhere.<br/><br/>Well, is there any way to prevent Little Girl from getting angry, while keeping her at home so that only I can see her?<br/><br/>“We’re going to have dinner together, George, and Little Daniel. Want to join?” Allonzo Hobson said.<br/><br/>George:<br/><br/>He squinted his eyes and turned her head forcefully with his hand that was holding her chin.<br/><br/>As the two looked into each other’s eyes, Kevin’s narrowed eyes were filled with ruthlessness, as if he could eat her in the next second. Daisy’s eyes were full of laughter, and perhaps because she was holding in her laughter, her eyes were filled with unshed tears.<br/><br/>After a few seconds of eye contact, Kevin lost the staring contest and then pinched her face affectionately with the hand that was holding her chin, and laughed along with her.<br/><br/>Allonzo Hobson, who saw Kevin lose the battle with Daisy every time, also laughed with them.<br/><br/>When they arrived at the Doomsday Hotel and entered the private booth, Kevin eyed the three “love rivals” sitting at the table, especially Daisy, who was sitting next to Joseph Allen.<br/><br/>Only then did he realize why she suddenly brought up Bonnie Maxwell in the car.<br/><br/>After sitting down, Kevin leaned into her ear and said, “Little girl, I hold grudges, you know.”<br/><br/>“So?” Daisy tilted her head to look at his eyebrows and eyes.<br/><br/>“So, you’ll pay for this sooner or later.”<br/><br/>Daisy smiled a little, shifted her gaze, picked up her glass, and took a sip of water.<br/><br/>It was still early, around 5 o’clock, so only wine and water were served as dinner was not yet ready. Everyone chatted for a while.<br/><br/>They were all from various fields, so their conversations covered a wide range of topics.<br/><br/>They talked about the fashion industry for a while, the entertainment industry, and even touched on the legal profession.<br/><br/>They even discussed Marsh Turner’s academic performance for a bit.<br/><br/>Mr. Turner sighed, “I can’t help but wonder if our family’s genes have mutated. How can someone’s grades be so poor?”<br/><br/>Marsh Turner: This feeling of being publicly punished.<br/><br/>“Although Allonzo was naughty when he was in school, his grades were never bad,” added Mr. Turner.<br/><br/>“Maybe it’s my mom’s family genes that aren’t good.”<br/><br/>Mrs. Turner glared at him.<br/><br/>“Don’t talk nonsense!” Mr. Turner defended his wife, “Your mother’s grades were always at the top of her class when I was watching her.”<br/><br/>Daisy listened, then suddenly raised her eyebrows.<br/><br/>Kevin explained from the side, “Allonzo’s uncle is two years older than his aunt, and he was always the senior watching over the junior. From middle school all the way to Senior Three.”<br/><br/>“It’s also considered a certain level of raising,” Daisy said.<br/><br/>Allonzo laughed, “Fortunately, I was born in a good family. Otherwise, with these grades, I wouldn’t even be able to marry a wife.”<br/><br/>Marsh Turner looked at Allonzo, just in time to see Daisy smile.<br/><br/>Although it wasn’t a mocking smile, Marsh Turner’s face still felt hot.<br/><br/>“For the midterm exams this semester, I’ll make sure to be the Grade Topper for you all.”<br/><br/>Allonzo raised his eyebrows, looked at Daisy, and smiled, “Alright, I’m waiting.”<br/><br/>You little rascal, there’s no stopping you.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
