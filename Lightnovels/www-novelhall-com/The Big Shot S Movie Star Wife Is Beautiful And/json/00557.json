Suddenly, without Wilton by his side, he was not used to it.<br/><br/>In the past, when he secretly went to Truro City, Uncle Wilton wasn’t with him, but he knew that Wilton was always there, so it was alright.<br/><br/>But now, suddenly, he felt very uncomfortable.<br/><br/>However, no one else could help him with this kind of problem.<br/><br/>Uncle Wilton’s position could not be replaced by anyone else.<br/><br/>So, Charles could only slowly adjust by himself.<br/><br/>The Research Institute got busier, with Kevin Clark and Charlotte Lane hardly returning home for a month. They almost always stayed in the Research Institute Dormitory.<br/><br/>William’s situation was similar.<br/><br/>However, on the day Olivia entered school, the two siblings took time off to see her off.<br/><br/>Later, they were photographed at Imperial Capital University.<br/><br/>Similarly, somehow when the photos appeared on the hot search, Olivia was once again photoshopped out.<br/><br/>Although Charlotte was a student at Imperial Capital University, she always went straight to the laboratory from the entrance and had never taken a closer look at the campus.<br/><br/>This time, after helping Olivia settle in, the three siblings looked around.<br/><br/>And then they were photographed.<br/><br/>The three siblings were standing in line according to their height, with Olivia being photoshopped out on the side.<br/><br/>Charlotte hadn’t appeared for a long time, and her appearance on the internet immediately became a hot search.<br/><br/>Online comments were either about how well-matched Charlotte and William were, or curious about why they had such a good relationship.<br/><br/>Few comments suggested that their relationship was inappropriate; such comments were drowned out by others.<br/><br/>Another group, composed of Hugo Clark and William Lane’s CP fans, were working hard to find details and explain that the two were just ordinary friends, not wanting to let their beloved CP end.<br/><br/>Neither Charlotte nor Hill Dawson responded to this.<br/><br/>There was no need to respond to this obvious excitement.<br/><br/>However, after about ten hours, Kevin Clark suddenly updated his Facebook post while working in the laboratory.<br/><br/>[Keep your eyes wide open and don’t fall for the wrong CP.]<br/><br/>People had just about gotten over the excitement, but his post set off another wave of activity.<br/><br/>Everyone was laughing in the comments below his Facebook post.<br/><br/>Later in the evening, he complained to his wife, feeling wronged.<br/><br/>In the afternoon, after work, Charlotte, Kevin, and William Lane decided to visit the Lane family home.<br/><br/>William drove while the other two sat in the back.<br/><br/>As the car started, William looked in the rearview mirror and said, “I’m at least your big cousin, and you’re making me be your driver.”<br/><br/>“There’s only your Third Uncle and Third Aunt here,” said Kevin, leisurely sitting in the back.<br/><br/>Charlotte: “......”<br/><br/>“Do you have any shame?” William scolded.<br/><br/>“That’s a fact,” said Kevin.<br/><br/>“Why don’t you two get out and fight first?” suggested Charlotte, “Like when you were kids, fighting until one of you bleeds from the head?”<br/><br/>“He made my head bleed,” they both said in unison.<br/><br/>Charlotte: “......” Why did she join this topic? It made her seem unintelligent.<br/><br/>“Keep an eye on Turner Daniel and the Santiago family,” Charlotte changed the subject, “Although Dean Yue hasn’t publicly announced that Turner should take over the Research Institute, his recent attention to Turner, and Turner’s rapid progress, are too eye-catching.”<br/><br/>Kevin: “Alright. The Santiago family has already sent people to secretly protect them.”<br/><br/>William added, “Santiago’s security has always been good, so you can rest assured. During special times, they will also pay extra attention.”<br/><br/>Charlotte nodded, then said after a while, “Don’t you think Dean Yue is a bit strange?”<br/><br/>“How so?” Kevin asked.<br/><br/>“Isn’t he being too deliberate in making people know that he wants Turner to take over the Research Institute?” Charlotte said, “Isn’t this going to make it easier for people to attack Turner early?”<br/><br/>“He needs Turner to learn things quickly and needs to prove Turner’s ability quickly. He can learn covertly, but to prove his ability, he needs to show people. It’s not a deliberate move; it’s something he has to do,” Kevin squeezed her hand and said.<br/><br/>Charlotte naturally understood this reasoning, but she felt that something still wasn’t quite right.<br/><br/>Kevin patted her head: “Madam has a long way to go. In addition to being busy with her own affairs, she also has to work hard with that brat from the Santiago family.”<br/><br/>Listening to his sour tone, Charlotte was about to speak when her cellphone beeped continuously.<br/><br/>She took it out and saw that Anisa Cooper and Hill Dawson were continuously sending her messages.<br/><br/>Kevin sat next to her and naturally saw the messages: “What happened online?”<br/><br/>Charlotte clicked on the messages. Both Anisa and Hill were sending her question marks and exclamation marks, so she scrolled up directly.<br/><br/>She saw an article link that Hill had forwarded.<br/><br/>There was a big, straightforward headline that made it easy to know what was happening online without even clicking the article.<br/><br/>[What do you think about the possibility that “Daisy Zane” is not Daisy Zane?]<br/><br/>...\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
