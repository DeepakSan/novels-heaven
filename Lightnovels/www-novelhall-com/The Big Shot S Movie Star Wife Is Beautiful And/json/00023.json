It wasn’t until two hours later that Michael Jackson called Kevin Clark and brought the medicine. <br/><br/>Only then did he wake up Daisy Zane. <br/><br/>“Lucia, wake up, take the medicine first.” <br/><br/>His voice was too gentle and pleasant to hear. Daisy Zane opened her eyes, her vision was somewhat blurred as she looked at the person in front of her. After looking for a while, she sat upright and then glanced at the clock in the living room. <br/><br/>She had slept this long. <br/><br/>And she had slept so soundly. <br/><br/>“Take the medicine first.” Kevin Clark took out the medicine she needed to take and placed it on a tissue paper, with a cup of warm water beside it. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane glanced at the drug bottle put on the side. It was a drug from the Pharmaceutical Formulation Institute. Witness the birth of this content, streaming forth from n0v!lbin★<br/><br/>Noticing her gaze, Kevin Clark said, “It’s a drug from the Research Institute, which has already gone through the marketing process. You can take it with confidence.’ <br/><br/>It wasn’t a problem for the Clark Family to get the medicine from the Research Institute, not thinking much, Daisy Zane took the medicine. <br/><br/>“Do you want to sleep a little longer, or eat something first?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane leaned back on the sofa and said, “I’m hungry.” She only had water since last night and also had a drink. <br/><br/>“What’d you like to eat?” <br/><br/>“Red Date and Lotus Seed Porridge.” <br/><br/>In the past, every time they went out for a meal, Daisy Zane was only responsible for eating. As for what to eat or order, she didn’t care, she’d eat whatever was available. <br/><br/>This was the first time she actively ordered food which made Kevin Clark a little happy. <br/><br/>“Okay. I’ll have it sent over.” <br/><br/>The porridge was delivered by the people at Doomsday Hotel, they also brought a fish soup and a few small dishes. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at the “Doomsday Hotel” characters printed on the packing box. Her appetite, which was originally for a bowl of porridge, soared, and she ended up eating more than half a bowl of rice. <br/><br/>“Have some soup too.” Kevin Clark was no longer surprised by her appetite and served her another bowl of soup when he saw she’d nearly finished eating. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane slowly sipped the soup with a spoon, her eyes downcast, very quiet, without making a sound. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark sat across her, observing her. <br/><br/>Peaceful and beautiful. <br/><br/>NIAN: [A director is looking for me. Should I take part in a show? It will last for a maximum of four months.] <br/><br/>Daisy Zane: [Ok.] <br/><br/>After replying to the message, she tossed her cell phone aside and looked at Kevin Clark, who was staring at her: “Have you seen enough?” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark chuckled, slightly seductively, but did not answer the question: “How can you be so calm?” <br/><br/>“As expected.” <br/><br/>“Did you have a dispute?” Kevin Clark asked. <br/><br/>“Minor disputes.” These things were really minor disputes for Daisy Zane, not enough to cause her too much concern. “It’s inevitable in this industry, part of life’s amusement. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark nodded: “This mindset isn’t bad.” <br/><br/>After Kevin Clark left, Daisy Zane sent Holt Lawrence a message, asking him to look up Olivia Chester’s connections and the investors behind the “Fall of the Quince” drama crew. <br/><br/>Holt Lawrence agreed quickly, but his next message was: [Nana, in another month, the maple leaves in the Imperial Capital will turn red. Shouldn’t you come back to have a look?] [I am filming, no time.] <br/><br/>[Then I can visit your set.] [I don’t want to spread scandal with an old man.] <br/><br/>[End of a friendship, block!] <br/><br/>Daisy Zane ignored him and went back to her bedroom to sleep. <br/><br/>She slept until past 9 0’clock, and if it weren’t for her phone ringing, she could have continued sleeping. <br/><br/>It was an unknown number. She answered the call and, before she could say anything, a voice came from the other end. <br/><br/>It was Clarissa Mason. <br/><br/>Her voice was so triumphant, it sounded like her tail was about to stick up to the sky. <br/><br/>“Daisy Zane, I’m signing the contract tomorrow and will join the crew the day after,” Clarissa Mason said, “What are you doing? You wouldn’t have cried all night, would you?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane: . ” What an idiot. <br/><br/>“Is your agent looking for a script for you? I think you should give up. Know your place. Even with a bad script, if they can’t find an actor, they still wouldn’t pick you.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane tossed the cell phone aside and took a sip of water from the thermos cup on the bedside table. <br/><br/>This all-black thermos cup was left here by Kevin Clark yesterday, who reminded her repeatedly not to drink cold water. <br/><br/>Looking at the thermos cup in her hand, she recalled that line: “Black goes with everything. ” <br/><br/>“Daisy Zane, let me tell you. I’m better than you in every way. The role last time was an accident. Any person could play that insignificant role, it’s just that you got the windfall. But for important roles, you don’t even compare to a single strand of my hair.” <br/><br/>“Well, you might want to hold onto this stolen role. After all, it’s not yours, it will be hard to keep it,” Daisy Zane said, too lazy to listen to her cackle, she immediately hung up the phone..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
