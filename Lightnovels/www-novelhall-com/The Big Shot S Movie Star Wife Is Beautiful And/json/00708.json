Oh my gosh! After so many years, I finally got to see Sister Brook join the drama crew.]<br/><br/>[Breaking news, breaking news, we have pictures and truth, Sister Brook has joined the cast!]<br/><br/>[It must be because of my good deeds and my generous heart that touched the heavens, allowing Sister Brook to join the cast.]<br/><br/>[To celebrate Sister Brook joining the casting crew, my dessert shop is offering a 30% discount today!]<br/><br/>[Ahhhhhhhh! A living, breathing Dean Lane! My idol!]<br/><br/>[Help! In my lifetime! Omigod! I want to go stalk the drama crew.]<br/><br/>[Sister Brook! Sister Brook! Sister Brook!]<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Online buzz was lively, while at the same time, Charlotte Lane was packing her luggage at Clark Manor.<br/><br/>She had visited the drama crew yesterday for a makeup test after leaving the Research Institute, and returned afterwards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She was planning to start her several days of shooting today.<br/><br/>Noah Clark and Ethan Clark are both five-year-olds, and there are plenty of people at home to look after them, so she doesn’t have to worry. Recently, Charlotte has assigned many tasks at the Research Institute to Turner Daniel.<br/><br/>When Morris mentioned wanting her to play a role, she agreed.<br/><br/>The filming location is in the Imperial Capital, so if anything comes up, she can return to the Research Institute in time.<br/><br/>“Mom, how long will you be gone?” Noah Clark, squatting by the suitcase, was helping her fold clothes.<br/><br/>Ethan Clark, of course, was sitting on the other side of the suitcase, folding clothes neatly and placing them inside.<br/><br/>“I’m not sure yet.” Charlotte stood in the cloakroom, tossing clothes from her wardrobe into the suitcase for the two of them to fold.<br/><br/>“What if we miss you?” Noah had her head lowered and was folding clothes very seriously, with her cute child’s voice.<br/><br/>“You... guys?” When Charlotte said this, she specifically glanced at her own son.<br/><br/>Ethan Clark felt the gaze and looked up at her for a moment before lowering his gaze again. After a pause, he said, “I’ll miss you too.”<br/><br/>“You can’t wait for me to leave, can you?” Charlotte chuckled.<br/><br/>Her two children resembled their father in appearance, with her son looking like his father and her daughter looking like her mother.<br/><br/>Ethan Clark looked strikingly similar to Arthur North as a child, with only a hint of Charlotte in his nose and lips.<br/><br/>He had some of Charlotte’s genes, but not much.<br/><br/>However, his character was complex as if it mixed influences from both families, or maybe not just the two families, but also molded by people he interacted with in his day-to-day life.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two little ones were playing with Lego. Seeing Kevin return, Noah smiled and called out, “Dad.”<br/><br/>“Hmm.”<br/><br/>Kevin walked closer and touched her little head.<br/><br/>“Mom went to the drama crew,” Ethan said.<br/><br/>Kevin frowned slightly. Wasn’t it agreed that he would see her off when he returned? Why did she leave when he came back?<br/><br/>“Mom said, you said you’d send her off, but she didn’t agree.” Ethan continued, “So she left early.”<br/><br/>Kevin had a meeting early tomorrow morning. Sending Charlotte to the drama crew would mean returning late at night or rushing back early the next day.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Charlotte thought it would be too tiring for him to shuttle back and forth like this, so she didn’t wait for him.<br/><br/>“Mom doesn’t want you anymore.” Just as Kevin was about to call Charlotte, Ethan added.<br/><br/>Kevin gently poked his little butt and said coldly, “Your mom would only not want you.”<br/><br/>“I’ve seen that drama crew. There are many young and handsome guys.” Ethan pretended to casually say while playing with the Lego, “I heard there’s a new guy who really likes Mom.”<br/><br/>Noah glanced at her brother, pursed her lips, and said nothing.<br/><br/>Kevin suddenly narrowed his eyes and asked, “Ethan, what are you trying to say?”<br/><br/>“Nothing.” Ethan pretended nothing happened, “I just thought it’d be nice for our family not to have a stepfather.”<br/><br/>Kevin grabbed the back of his neck, made him turn around and look up at himself, and said coldly, “You just want to get rid of me so you and your sister can have fun at home.”<br/><br/>Parents are still parents after all. Kevin spoiled them, but he also had boundaries. He had to teach them what needed to be taught, only he was more patient compared to Charlotte’s straightforward and rough methods.<br/><br/>But kids this age have playful hearts and don’t have the patience to learn.<br/><br/>When Charlotte wasn’t at home, Kevin naturally wouldn’t be home either, so it’s best if the grandparents or older siblings looked after them.<br/><br/>So, little Ethan had an idea.<br/><br/>“Hehe.” Ethan’s plan was exposed; he grabbed Kevin’s leg with a little hand, looked up and giggled, “Dad, you’re not worried?”<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Worried.” Kevin squatted down, pinched his little face, smiled, and said gently, “So... after the meeting tomorrow morning, I’ll take you both to find Mom. When I’m not around, you’ll help me protect her.”<br/><br/>“Okay.” Noah obediently agreed.<br/><br/>She enjoyed being with Charlotte since her mom was pretty and had lots of beautiful clothes and jewelry.<br/><br/>Since they had watched many TV series with Tom Wayne, they were curious about visiting a drama crew for the first time.<br/><br/>Ethan, on the other hand, drooped and performed a disappearing smile trick, completely deflating.<br/><br/>Their plan succeeded, but they had buried themselves along the way.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
