But now the yard was suddenly bald, so it stood out. <br/><br/>“Why not just pull it out as well?” Daisy Zane asked. <br/><br/>“Let’s keep it,” Kevin Clark replied, “and enjoy the shade under it when it grows up.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at the sapling swaying in the wind, not even sure if it could survive: “It’ll be decades before we can enjoy the shade under it, right?” Kevin Clark raised his eyebrows and smiled. <br/><br/>Suddenly understanding what he meant, Daisy Zane glanced at him and said nothing. <br/><br/>Decades, such a long time, she didn’t even dare to think about it. <br/><br/>That day, besides pulling weeds in the morning, Daisy Zane did nothing but wait for meals. <br/><br/>She initially wanted to help cook but ended up breaking a plate by turning around. <br/><br/>Without hesitation, Kevin Clark kicked her out of the kitchen, not even giving her the chance to tend the fire. <br/><br/>“Actually, I...” <br/><br/>“Daisy, if you break another one, there’ll be nowhere to put the dishes.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane stood at the kitchen entrance, watching Kevin Clark surrounded by hot air.

Let’s stay a few more days.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane stood at the door, watching him. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark continued, “It’s nice here. Although it’s inconvenient, it’s peaceful. It’s just the two of us, and no one can disturb us. Besides, we haven’t finished the food I brought.” <br/><br/>“I’ve worn all the clothes I brought,” Daisy Zane replied, “and there’s nothing clean left to wear. I don’t want to do laundry. Let’s go back tomorrow.” Kevin Clark stopped what he was doing and looked at her: “Daisy...” <br/><br/>“Let’s go back,” Daisy Zane insisted. <br/><br/>“Alright,” Kevin Clark said softly, “If you want to come back, I’ll accompany you anytime.” <br/><br/>“Yeah.” <br/><br/>“I’m sorry, the number you dialed is switched off.” <br/><br/>Having no signal for over 30 minutes, the beep has turned into a power-off beep. <br/><br/>After the beep ended, Morris dialed again without giving up. <br/><br/>This time, just hearing an “I’m sorry” inside, he hung up the phone. <br/><br/>“Why hasn’t she come back yet?” Morris looked at George Dunn beside him. <br/><br/>At the Miles Family’s side, Liam Davis came over for a New Year’s visit and was chatting in the living room. <br/><br/>Suddenly, his phone rang. <br/><br/>He saw that it was his mother, so he went outside to answer the call. <br/><br/>“Mom, what’s wrong?” <br/><br/>“Where are you? Are you at the Miles Family’s place?” Mrs. Davis said. <br/><br/>Liam Davis admitted directly, “Yes, I’m at the Miles Family.” <br/><br/>“Get your ass back here!” Mrs. Davis yelled, “That little bitch has really blinded you, you’re even visiting the Miles Family for the New Year!” <br/><br/>“Mom! Don’t talk about her like that. <br/><br/>“You’re still defending her. She’s been with that director Morris, and you’re not even a spare tire; you’re still foolishly protecting her.” Mrs. Davis said, “Let me tell you, a slut like her will never step foot into the Davis Residence unless I’m dead!” <br/><br/>“Mom, what are you talking about, Morris?” <br/><br/>“The news about her is all over the internet. Go see for yourself.” Mrs. Davis said angrily, “She’s really good at seducing men, no wonder you were blinded by her. It’s a good thing she won’t enter our family now. Get back here!” <br/><br/>After hanging up, Liam Davis checked the news online and saw it filled with curses. <br/><br/>He immediately called Daisy Zane’s phone again, and it still showed that it was turned off. <br/><br/>After standing in the courtyard for a while, Liam Davis returned to the living room, excused himself, and hurriedly left. <br/><br/>Old Master Miles watched his retreating figure and asked, “What happened? Why did he leave so hurriedly?” <br/><br/>Charles Hobson sat to one side, took a slow sip of tea, and said, “He probably saw the news online.” <br/><br/>Johanes Miles sensed that this matter might be related to their family, and his brows furrowed, “What news?” <br/><br/>Charles Hobson glanced at him and handed him his cell phone: “Daisy Zane has some kind of relationship with a very famous director in Imperial Capital. It was exposed online today.” <br/><br/>Johanes Miles glanced at the phone, at those curses, and didn’t say anything for a moment. <br/><br/>“What’s going on? Let me see.” Old Master Miles said. <br/><br/>Johanes Miles handed the phone to his father. <br/><br/>The old master took the phone, put on the glasses hanging around his neck, and slowly browsed the posts. <br/><br/>After a while, he asked, “This Morris, what does his family do?” <br/><br/>Charles Hobson: “......” For the Miles Family, who the son-in-law is isn’t important, what’s important is how large of a background the son-in-law has. <br/><br/>“Morris’s family is pretty complicated. He took some money from home, and then he severed all ties with his family.” Charles Hobson said. <br/><br/>Old Master looked at him, “I see. So, he doesn’t have much of a background.” <br/><br/>“Although he is a big director...” Johanes Miles said, “Looking at the wind direction online, I fear that this director will fail down the line. <br/><br/>“Right.” Old Master Miles nods, pondered for a moment, and said, “Hold off on releasing news of the Family Recognition Banquet for now. If this news is true, Liam Davis’s side will certainly not marry Daisy Zane again. We don’t need to recognize our daughter just for a director who’s going downhill. Moreover, if the news is true, then our family will be implicated if we recognize her.” <br/><br/>“I understand, Dad.” <br/><br/>Charles Hobson listened to the father and son’s conversation on the side. She was happy that there would be no recognition banquet, but at the same time felt cold -hearted. <br/><br/>In their eyes, nothing was more important than the Miles family, only the Miles family mattered. <br/><br/>If it weren’t for her family supporting her and her son being outstanding, she would probably have been driven out of the Miles family long ago..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
