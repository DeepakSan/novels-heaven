Did they bother you?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane shook her head.<br/><br/>“Do you want to see them?”<br/><br/>“Can I?”<br/><br/>“Yes,” Kevin said, “but you’ll have to wait a few days. They just took them out tonight.”<br/><br/>“Okay.”<br/><br/>After a while, the medicine cooled down. Daisy Zane picked up the bowl and drank it all in one go.<br/><br/>Afterward, she drank a couple more sips of water and lay down on the bed.<br/><br/>Kevin got into the bed too, affixed the heat pads on her body, and lay down, hugging her from behind. He slowly massaged her stomach: “Sleep now. If it hurts, just call me.”<br/><br/>“Mhm.”T/his chapter is updated by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m<br/><br/>The next day, Daisy Zane woke up unusually early.<br/><br/>But she did not go downstairs.<br/><br/>Kevin brought her breakfast and lunch.<br/><br/>She spent the morning upstairs writing a script.<br/><br/>During this half-day, the whole Dark Radiance was spreading the news.<br/><br/>Various forces are present, making it difficult to move goods from one side to the other, as they would be blocked by many forces.<br/><br/>However, for organizations like Dark Radiance the number of blocking forces would be reduced by 80%.<br/><br/>Because they dare not provoke and cannot afford to provoke.<br/><br/>But there will always be some who are stubborn and reckless.<br/><br/>Moreover, the bigger the tree, the more wind it attracts<br/><br/>When Daisy Zane spoke, everyone at the table looked at her.<br/><br/>If it weren’t for the authority of Kevin Clark, the expressions hidden in these people’s eyes would probably not let her sit at the table, let alone allow her to speak.<br/><br/>“Yeah,” Kevin answered.<br/><br/>Daisy looked at him and hesitated to ask, “Can I go?”<br/><br/>Upon hearing this, Thomas almost stood up and did two backward flips on the spot to prove that he was really fine.<br/><br/>Everyone’s faces changed drastically. What do you want to do? Will we have to take care of you? Isn’t this adding trouble to our already complicated situation?<br/><br/>Kevin was also somewhat worried. He was not concerned about Daisy’s safety, but rather her physical condition.<br/><br/>“I’m fine,” Daisy reassured him.<br/><br/>Kevin still hesitated. He had something to do tomorrow and couldn’t leave Dark Radiance.<br/><br/>Daisy said, “I won’t fight; I just want to go along for fun.”<br/><br/>“Do you really want to go?” Kevin asked gently.<br/><br/>Daisy nodded, glanced at the looks of the others who didn’t want her to go, and deliberately said casually, “I’ve never seen cargo transport before and haven’t been to the border. I’m curious and want to see it. To see the scenery of the borderline and take a few photos.”<br/><br/>It was as if she was going on a sightseeing trip.<br/><br/>Allonzo Hobson had just taken a sip of water, and he sprayed it all over Thomas Firway.<br/><br/>Thomas looked at him weakly.<br/><br/>Allonzo choked and coughed. How did she manage to be so nonchalantly bewitching? Was she trying to drive these people crazy?<br/><br/>Michael Jackson pursed his lips, holding back laughter. Darknight Alliance’s Nameless had seen all kinds of scenes<br/><br/>The more others thought she was useless, the more she described herself as useless.<br/><br/>The more they got upset that the Third Master was unconditionally biased towards her, the more she made the Third Master biased.<br/><br/>How many people will lose sleep tonight because of their anger?<br/><br/>Kevin looked at her, the laughter in his eyes growing deeper. And very cooperatively, he said, “If you want to go, you can. But be careful.”<br/><br/>“Alright,” Daisy looked at the others, continuing her soft and casual tone, “As long as they take care of me, I won’t make any trouble. If a fight breaks out, I’ll just cheer from the side. The precondition is that they take good care of me.”<br/><br/>It was a chilly tone and indifferent expression.<br/><br/>But it still made people perceive the words “Country-destroying seductress” in her demeanor.<br/><br/>Everyone stared at her, with faces full of frustration, as if they had just been forced to drink two jugs of swill water.<br/><br/>Even Siera Santiago, who was too weak to raise her head, glared at her.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane felt that the group wanted her to disappear on the spot.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark lowered his head, stifling his laughter to keep from laughing out loud.
