I’m not a bad person.”<br/><br/>Olivia Lane turned her gaze to Daisy Zane.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised her brows: “Robinson, stop teasing her.”<br/><br/>Robinson Scott backed off, muttered, “Brother Nine, I really wonder who this girl is. You’re so protective of her – even taking her out late at night.”<br/><br/>“Now that you mention it, I’m actually feeling a bit jealous,” James Collins said<br/><br/>Olivia Lane gave Daisy Zane a look.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane said, without missing a beat, “This hotel is her family’s.”<br/><br/>Robinson Scott was stunned, and then he took a sharp breath inward. Staring at Olivia Lane, he asked in disbelief, “The Lane family has another daughter?!”<br/><br/>Olivia Lane slightly frowned.<br/><br/>Robinson Scott gave her a once-over, then put on a friendly grin, “Little sister, can I have one of your family’s Gold Cards?”<br/><br/>Allonzo Hobson:<br/><br/>Olivia Lane:<br/><br/>“I’ve heard rumours that the top-floor couple-themed rooms are quite interesting,” Robinson started, “Can I have a Gold Card so that I get to experience it once?”<br/><br/>The top floor of the Doomsday Hotel had always been the private quarters of both Charlotte and Olivia Lane, never open to the public.<br/><br/>So everyone just assumed that the next floor down was the hotel’s top floor.<br/><br/>And only those with a gold card could access the top floor.<br/><br/>Olivia Lane’s face suddenly turned red.<br/><br/>Hugo Clark beamed, smirking at Olivia Lane.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hardy Clark squinted suspiciously at her brother. Something was off about him.<br/><br/>“Robinson ” Daisy Zane broke the silence.<br/><br/>Robinson Scott glanced at Olivia Lane, then at Daisy Zane. He sported a breezy smile as he leaned in towards Daisy, whispering, “Lucia I’m sure Third Master can access the top floor.”<br/><br/>After Arthur finished speaking, the pair looked at each other.<br/><br/>The others paused for a moment, and then Allonzo Hobson, completely ignoring Arthur’s words, laughed and said, “Brook Sister said we can do as we please. We’ll go to the fifth floor to have some fun. You two enjoy your tour.”<br/><br/>Hugo Clark and Hardy Clark turned to look at Arthur.<br/><br/>Arthur said, “Mmm, do as you please. Just don’t bother us.”<br/><br/>Hugo Clark and Hardy Clark: Got it, from now on their Auntie will be the head of this family.<br/><br/>“Alright then. Let’s go. We will have fun on the fifth floor. There’s a lot of recreational facilities on the fifth floor,” Allonzo said, “Once we’re tired, we will just sleep here. Third Master is paying for tonight.”<br/><br/>Arthur North ignored him.<br/><br/>Seeing that they were planning to have fun here, Daisy Zane looked at Olivia Lane and gently rubbed her head, “Don’t stay up too late.”<br/><br/>Hugo Clark’s gaze followed her hand as it moved up, resting on the ring on her finger.<br/><br/>The diamond on the ring was faintly tinged with icy blue.<br/><br/>This diamond Last year at the end of the year, his uncle had spent more than three hundred million to buy it on the M Continent.<br/><br/>At the time, he thought his uncle was buying it for his collection, but it turned out<br/><br/>Olivia Lane nodded.<br/><br/>James Collins silently stood by, watching them, feeling jealous.<br/><br/>But as they all began heading towards the elevator, Daisy Zane suddenly told Hugo, “Don’t drink alcohol.”<br/><br/>Hugo surprised, blinked blankly. But seeing the warning in Daisy Zane’s eyes, he quickly got the hint, “I ”<br/><br/>Arthur North was simply enjoying the show on the sidelines.<br/><br/>Hardy Clark was sneakily watching the show as well.<br/><br/>“I won’t drink,” Hugo confirmed after glancing at Arthur.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane put away her stern expression, but after a pause, she softly reminded him, “She’s only nineteen.”<br/><br/>Hugo felt a sudden pang of guilt, not just because of age. To others, he knew he was the unreliabil type, “I understand, I will respect her.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane seemed satisfied with his response and let him go.<br/><br/>Then, they all carefully avoided the lotus flowers scattered around as they made their way to the elevator.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
