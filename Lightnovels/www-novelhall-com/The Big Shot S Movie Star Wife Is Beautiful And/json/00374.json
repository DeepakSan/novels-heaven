How?<br/><br/>Divorce and get it again.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s face changed, and he immediately took the marriage certificate from Daisy Zane’s hand and put it together with his own: “Don’t even think about it. I’ll keep yours as well.”Th.ê most uptodate novels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at her empty hand and put it in her trouser pocket.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark looked at the marriage certificate of the two of them, looked at the photos of the two side by side, and after a while, gently took a breath, looked at Daisy Zane, and said softly, “Madam, happy new marriage.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at Kevin Clark’s reddened eyes due to excitement and happiness, also raised the corner of her mouth, and said softly, “Happy New Marriage.”<br/><br/>Both were wearing masks, and Daisy Zane’s hair was a bit messy due to the wind. Kevin Clark put her hair behind her ear, then lowered his head and kissed her through the mask: “Little Girl, we have our own home now.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn’t expect him to say that, her eyes flickered slightly. Suddenly, there was a feeling that someone pulled her out of the ice and snow and slowly warmed her heart.<br/><br/>“Mmm.”<br/><br/>After arriving at the airport, Daisy Zane took a photo of the marriage certificate.<br/><br/>Before boarding the plane, she posted a message on Facebook.<br/><br/>It was edited very simply.<br/><br/>She uploaded the photo of the marriage certificate and left a sentence: [In response to the rumors a while ago. I’m married.]<br/><br/>After posting the message, Daisy Zane turned off her phone.<br/><br/>At the moment she sent it, Kevin Clark also turned off his phone, so he didn’t receive the notification sound.<br/><br/>After the two got on the plane, Daisy Zane went to sleep. Kevin Clark picked up a magazine and read it with great concentration, occasionally hooking the corner of his mouth.<br/><br/>People who didn’t know would think that Third Master saw something funny, but Third Master laughed because the magazine had their marriage certificate inside.<br/><br/>People were already arranged outside the airport by Kevin Clark, and two suitcases of things were also prepared.<br/><br/>Everything was arranged by Kevin Clark to eat and use.<br/><br/>After more than three hours on the plane, they went straight to the car, and only then turned on their phones.<br/><br/>Arthur North:<br/><br/>Arthur North replied to a message from his mother and sent one to Xavier Dominic. As he started the car, he said, “The person on the marriage certificate is me. If you admit you’re married, you admit it’s to me.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane laughed and didn’t say anything more, just replied to Hill Dawson’s message.<br/><br/>After replying to a few messages, Hill Dawson said: [The Hobson Family’s public relations team contacted me. They’re experienced. Phoebe Turner’s public announcement was handled very well back then.]<br/><br/>Daisy Zane: [Then let them handle it.]<br/><br/>As soon as her message was sent, Arthur North’s cell phone rang.<br/><br/>Arthur North glanced at it while driving and picked it up right away, putting it on speaker.<br/><br/>“Arthur North! You didn’t even tell your mom about such a big thing as getting your marriage certificate!”<br/><br/>Tom Wayne’s voice suddenly filled the car. Daisy Zane’s expression paused, and she looked at Arthur North.<br/><br/>Elina Clark also grumbled, “You didn’t tell your dad either.”<br/><br/>Facing his parents’ angry scolding, Arthur North laughed, “I’m telling you now. Dad, Mom, I got the certificate.”<br/><br/>“Get lost! we would have turned grey waiting for you!”<br/><br/>Arthur North didn’t respond.<br/><br/>Tom Wayne continued: “Arthur North, with this sudden marriage certificate, did you bully that girl?!”<br/><br/>Arthur North:<br/><br/>Daisy Zane:<br/><br/>“Speak up! What are you pretending to be mute for?”<br/><br/>“No,” Arthur North said.<br/><br/>“Then why the hurry?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s eyelashes quivered slightly. Then she heard Tom Wayne say, “You really caught me off guard. I didn’t even have enough money for the bride price. I just bought an apartment, the location and environment are great. It was supposed to be a gift to Daisy, but you I haven’t even renovated the apartment yet!”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane leaned back in her seat and listened to their conversation.<br/><br/>Arthur North laughed, “Mom, you can start the renovation now. Prepare more for the bride price.”<br/><br/>“I don’t need you to tell me,” Tom Wayne yelled and then paused, “When are you bringing Daisy back?”<br/><br/>Arthur North glanced at Daisy Zane, “I’ll talk to her.”<br/><br/>“Okay. Let us know ahead of time.”<br/><br/>“Okay,” Arthur North said, “Is there anything else?”<br/><br/>“Nothing else, just wanted to scold you.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised the corner of her mouth and looked out the window.<br/><br/>Arthur North:<br/><br/>“Wait a minute, there’s something else ” Tom Wayne said, “The following sentence might be me meddling too much and overstepping my boundaries.”<br/><br/>“You may say it,” Arthur North said.<br/><br/>“If you guys want to have children, you should discuss it with Charles Amos. You can’t just disregard him. Charles Amos is so sensible, he would definitely agree, but you, as parents, should have the right attitude and respect for our children.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at the phone.<br/><br/>Arthur North’s eyes flashed lightly, saying, “We understand.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
