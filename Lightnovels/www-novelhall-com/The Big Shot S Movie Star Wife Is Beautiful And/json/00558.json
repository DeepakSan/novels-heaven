Inside the video, besides the “Daisy Zane” we see now and her grandma, there is a third person. Although the third person doesn’t show their face, they are a girl, and they call “Daisy Zane” “Shangshang”. Why don’t they call her a title related to the three characters of Daisy Zane?]<br/><br/>[Second, why is her name in the Research Institute called Nicholson Amos? Was she originally called Nicholson Amos? Why not use the name Daisy Zane instead?]<br/><br/>[Third, the phone recording with Johanes Miles. Don’t you think she sounded like an outsider when she mentioned Claudia Zane? She also said, “The Miles Family was originally Daisy Zane’s inheritance,” shouldn’t she have said, “The Miles Family was originally my inheritance”?]<br/><br/>[Fourth, as far as I know, in Cold Green Village, cell phones lose signal after entering. How did she... manage to have an identity in various fields? There is no doubt that she learned a lot of knowledge from her grandma, as she mentioned on the variety show. But don’t you think her knowledge is too broad? And many things cannot be mastered just by learning some knowledge, such as knowing fashion trends and what kind of scripts the audience likes. These are not things she can master if she occasionally leaves Cold Green Village unless she’s often not in Cold Green Village.]<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>After breaking down the whole article, the arguments are reasonable, and since there have always been doubts about her identity, when someone stood up to talk about it, online discussions exploded.<br/><br/>[I think the analysis makes so much sense, really, the more I see, the more it makes sense.]<br/><br/>[Actually, I’ve had these questions for a long time, but I’m a bit scared, and I never dared to say it. I’m afraid Third Master will silence me.]<br/><br/>[Same here, same here. I’m afraid, I’m genuinely afraid of Third Master, especially regarding the online rumors about him.]<br/><br/>[Usually, gossiping is fine, and I often go to Third Master’s Facebook page, but the nature of this matter is somewhat different. I’m also a little scared, and I don’t even dare to comment more.]<br/><br/>[And, have you guys noticed? Whenever Third Master tags a Facebook post, he always tags Flynn Ninevara’s Facebook.]<br/><br/>[Let’s assume the authenticity of this matter. So... who is our Flynn Ninevara?]<br/><br/>[Yeah, who is she? Is she called Nicholson Amos? Then who is Nicholson Amos?]<br/><br/>[Then why replace Daisy Zane’s identity? Where is the real Daisy Zane?]<br/><br/>[My goodness. Is Flynn Ninevara here to avenge the Miles Family?]<br/><br/>[!!!!!!!!!!!]<br/><br/>[Oh my, the most intuitive thought, the Miles Family is in big trouble.]<br/><br/>[Well, it’s their own fault. Old Master Miles killed Claudia Zane. Has the Miles Family ever done a good deed?]<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane was browsing online comments in the car and flipping through them casually.<br/><br/>As she was reading, Holt Lawrence sent her a message.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark patted her head: “You can tell me whenever you want to, or you don’t have to.”<br/><br/>William glanced at Charlotte, looking as unexpressive as usual.<br/><br/>Charlotte didn’t say anything, looking out the car window instead.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>William personally dealt with the Lane Family’s relatives. The online discussions cooled down since nobody bought the heat. Although they still talked about it, it quickly dropped off the hot search.<br/><br/>It seemed like people just wanted a lively discussion, coming and going quickly.<br/><br/>And one of the main reasons was... those anti-fans didn’t show up.<br/><br/>Since the last time they filmed Charlotte and William, the anti-fans dwindled significantly.<br/><br/>This time, without their involvement, there were only scattered small groups, barely noticeable, and even ignorable.<br/><br/>Suddenly, people found it hard to adapt.<br/><br/>So after discussing Charlotte’s matter, people were even more curious about where those anti-fans had gone.<br/><br/>In the past, they were even more excited than fans when the wind blew the grass.<br/><br/>They couldn’t wait to analyze the videos frame by frame to criticize “Daisy Zane.”<br/><br/>But now, after two hot searches without a trace, people felt something was off.<br/><br/>At the height of everyone’s curiosity.<br/><br/>From an anti-fan group, a fan suddenly shared a few screenshots to the fan group.<br/><br/>[More than a dozen anti-fan groups suddenly disbanded.]<br/><br/>[Before the anti-fan leader disbanded the group, she advised everyone to turn a new leaf and open their eyes. She said, if you really look with your heart, without prejudice, Daisy Zane is a role model, no matter as an actress or any other identity. She deserves everyone’s love.]<br/><br/>The fans in the group were dumbfounded.<br/><br/>At this point, the anti-fan leader updated her Facebook with a new post.<br/><br/>[Starting today, I will leave the internet, and this is the last post I will make. I deeply apologize for my previous actions against Miss Daisy Zane. In the future, I will deeply repent and hope to be forgiven by Lady Zane. Also, I want to say that I hope everyone will never get to know someone with prejudice or jealousy. And don’t purposely criticize anyone just to criticize.]\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
