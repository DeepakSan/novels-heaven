However, with her other cheek pressed against his chest, there was nowhere to evade. She rubbed herself against him and asked, “What are you doing?” <br/><br/>Feeling her smooth skin through his shirt, Arthur North’s heart itched. If it weren’t for the wrong timing, he would have teased her. He took out his cell phone while whispering in her ear, “319.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane immediately realized that the bottle on the ground was 319. Her body suddenly froze but she didn’t move: “Which way did they go?” <br/><br/>“To the right.’ <br/><br/>“Get surveillance. Don’t let them get away.” Daisy Zane quickly recalled the schedule for the Spotlight Gala and whispered, “The event downstairs will probably end in another half an hour. We can lock it down for a while.” <br/><br/>“Okay.” Arthur North quickly sent a message, “It’s already being done. Let’s go straight to the surveillance room.” <br/><br/>“What about Best Actress Turner...” <br/><br/>“I’ll text her now and tell them not to leave the private room.” Arthur North had one hand around her waist and the other holding the cell phone, showing no intention of letting her go. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s mind had already flown far away, even remembering the hotel layout she had glanced at unintentionally, completely oblivious to the fact that she was still in Arthur North’s arms. <br/><br/>“Do you want to tell Felix Baker too?” Arthur North asked. New novel chapters are published on<br/><br/>Daisy Zane knew that Arthur North must have already known about her acquaintance with Felix Baker, but she didn’t talk about her affairs, and he rarely asked deliberately. <br/><br/>“My cell phone is with Sister Emily.” Daisy Zane suddenly realized she was still in his arms and quickly straightened up, taking a step back. Arthur North naturally retracted his arm. <br/><br/>“Let’s go, to the surveillance room,” Daisy Zane said. <br/><br/>“Okay.” <br/><br/>The pair exited the restroom together and after a few steps, Daisy Zane asked, <br/><br/>“Can I borrow your cell phone? I want to make a call to Felix.” <br/><br/>Arthur North handed her the phone, watching her skillfully input a mobile number and make the call. <br/><br/>Despite his impassive expression, his heart was already churning. Their relationship had progressed to the point where they remembered each other’s phone numbers. <br/><br/>This Felix...tsk...he shouldn’t have it so easy. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane took her eyes off the surveillance, “Check his consumption records.” <br/><br/>“Alright,” Kevin Clark agreed, looking at her somewhat pale face, he walked over to her and held her hand. <br/><br/>Clark’s people instinctively glanced at their intertwined hands, then hurriedly looked away, not daring to stare or get distracted. <br/><br/>“Third Master, the three people in the other room are coming out,” someone reported. <br/><br/>Everyone looked at the surveillance, and Kevin Clark said: “Keep them on the <br/><br/>12th floor.’ <br/><br/>“Yes.” <br/><br/>“It seems they’ve noticed something,” Daisy Zane said, looking at the surveillance. <br/><br/>“So clever, seems like a habitual offender,” Kevin Clark said. <br/><br/>“Let’s arrest them directly,” Daisy Zane suggested, “They’ve already sensed something, and if there are any accomplices, they’ve already been notified.” <br/><br/>“Alright,” Kevin Clark agreed and looked back at his people. <br/><br/>His men nodded and immediately left. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked towards the doorway, “I’ll go check it out too.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark looked at her. <br/><br/>They’re all men... it’s easier for me to go,” Daisy Zane said. <br/><br/>She wanted to kill them all. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark understood her intentions. Six men, with a girl who had been drugged and was disoriented from room 319, what could happen? <br/><br/>“Together.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark and Daisy Zane entered the elevator together, but as soon as they reached the 12th floor, the smoke alarm on the 12th floor went off. <br/><br/>There was a faint smell of smoke in the hallway, and in an instant, a large number of people rushed out. <br/><br/>In the chaos, people looked left and right, walked around, bumped into each other, and asked one another what was going on. Kevin Clark’s men were scattered and trapped in the crowd. <br/><br/>“Third Master, be careful,” Kevin Clark’s men immediately guarded him and Daisy Zane. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane moved through the chaotic crowd and met the gaze of the person she saw on the surveillance. <br/><br/>That person gave her a glance, then quickly led the other three people away. <br/><br/>“Keep an eye on the people in the room, and have the people guarding the floors calm the crowd,” Kevin Clark instructed. <br/><br/>“They’ve gone to the fire access lane,” Daisy Zane pulled the person blocking her and said, “Ask the surveillance room staff if they went upstairs or downstairs..”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
