But they were still a bit worried about Daisy Zane.<br/><br/>Even though they had resentment, she was their big boss’s wife.<br/><br/>Before leaving, Kevin Clark constantly reminded them to take good care of her.<br/><br/>They didn’t dare to disobey.<br/><br/>So a few people discussed it, and James Cooper, who looked kinder, went to ask her.<br/><br/>The convoy stopped, and Daisy Zane looked out.<br/><br/>It was calm.<br/><br/>Soon, James Cooper came over and knocked on the car window. The window rolled down, and he said, “Lady Zane, are you alright? It’s a long journey, do you want to rest here for a bit?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane glanced at the time and said, “No need. Just follow your pace, or we won’t reach the resting place before evening.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane thought they might have slowed down the car.<br/><br/>James Cooper hesitated for a moment, and instinctively nodded after hearing her arrangement, “Yes, No. It’s a long journey. We’re worried about your body.”<br/><br/>“I’m fine,” Daisy Zane said. “You can rest when you need to.”<br/><br/>“Alright.”<br/><br/>Not long after James Cooper left, the car continued to move forward.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane put her laptop on her lap and continued to work on the script.<br/><br/>After James Cooper returned, he told Adrian Roberts what Daisy Zane had said.<br/><br/>Adrian’s face, which had been livid for a day, finally got better, “She’s understanding and not fussy.”<br/><br/>James Cooper nodded.<br/><br/>“Whether she’s good at it or not, whether she’s strong or not, is secondary. Third Master didn’t marry a wife to train a killer,” Adrian Roberts said. “The most important thing is her perspective. Just don’t be petty.”<br/><br/>He had been unhappy since he found out last night that Thomas Firway and Siera Santiago got paralyzed as punishment.<br/><br/>He didn’t think this woman was a good kind.<br/><br/>But after such a short time getting along, she didn’t cause him any trouble.<br/><br/>She didn’t cause him any trouble, so he thought she was ok.<br/><br/>They took two breaks on the way and arrived at their resting place in the M Continent before it got dark.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn’t have much interaction with them and went back to her room after dinner.<br/><br/>James Cooper and Adrian Roberts had actions to carry out at night, and she didn’t ask about it.<br/><br/>Instead, after returning to the room, she looked at the time and asked in their group chat, “[Are there any tasks in M Continent? I’ll help you complete them.]<br/><br/>Luke : [?????????]<br/><br/>Logan : [??? Boss, you’re in M Continent?!]<br/><br/>As for her, there was fish and meat, along with three dishes and soup.<br/><br/>This luxurious and comfortable life.<br/><br/>“My cooking skills aren’t great, please don’t be picky,” he said.<br/><br/>“Let’s eat together.” Daisy Zane replied.<br/><br/>“I’m not...”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at him, and Michael Jackson swallowed back his words: “Alright, Lady Zane.”<br/><br/>As long as one can cook on a fire and avoid burning the food, the dishes shouldn’t taste too bad with the ready-prepared ingredients.<br/><br/>While eating, Daisy Zane said, “I have a reasonable suspicion that your Third Master wants to harm me.”<br/><br/>Michael Jackson understood what she was talking about and chuckled.<br/><br/>“Just look, if it wasn’t for Kevin Clark’s authority, I reckon this group would have already thrown me into the ravine we just passed.”<br/><br/>“Even combined, this group wouldn’t be a match for Lady Zane, right?” Michael Jackson said.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised her eyebrows slightly, continued eating, and said nothing.<br/><br/>Because Daisy Zane’s lunchtime took a while, the afternoon break was longer.<br/><br/>With everyone waiting for a long time, they started chatting idly.<br/><br/>“Troy Walker’s underground boxing arena was bombed last night; who do you think did it?”<br/><br/>“It’s hard to say with the mixed powers in M Continent. But I heard it was a woman with a covered face and long hair.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, the rumor has it the woman entered the arena first and then fought Troy Walker one-on-one.”<br/><br/>“Not just one-on-one? I heard she played with him like a toy. Knocked him down in the ring, let him get up, knocked him down again. It was just humiliation.”<br/><br/>“Many people witnessed it. When the woman floored Troy Walker completely, that’s when others stormed in and cleared the place. Many were captured.”<br/><br/>“I heard there was a trade of illegal drugs. Many people participated. It was a busy night in the boxing arena.”<br/><br/>“Then they cleared the place and bombed the arena.”<br/><br/>“It’s a large power. Troy Walker has a prominent status in M Continent, otherwise, he wouldn’t dare to do such things. To be eliminated just like that.”<br/><br/>“It’s rare for a woman to be this powerful. Among us, who can take on Troy Walker alone?”<br/><br/>Everyone fell silent.<br/><br/>After a while, someone glanced at Daisy Zane. Seeing her leisurely and relaxed like she was on a picnic, they muttered, “Both are women, why is there such a big difference?”<br/><br/>Everyone went silent once more.<br/><br/>As Michael Jackson listened to their conversation, he suddenly turned his head to look at Daisy Zane.<br/><br/>A woman with long hair...<br/><br/>“Why are you looking at me?” Daisy Zane said, “Do you think it was me?”<br/><br/>“Was it?” Michael Jackson asked quietly. He thought of how she had been sleeping in the car all night and wondered if she had stayed up the night before.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane chuckled but said nothing.<br/><br/>Michael Jackson’s eyes widened. She didn’t deny it!<br/><br/>Last night he had slept like the dead, while the person Third Master asked him to take care of went to blow up the boxing arena.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
