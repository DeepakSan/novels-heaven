I was the one who took care of you when you were living in the village,” the man said, his voice choking up. “What am I to you now that you’re married to someone else? I gave you all the money I had saved for my own marriage to help you come to the big city, and yet you turn your back on me just like that. We cannot be so ungrateful, Daisy. It’s okay if you deceive my feelings, but doing this is a betrayal to your current husband and your fans ”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane couldn’t control her strength, and she crushed the tempered glass on her cell phone.<br/><br/>Holt Lawrence looked at the shattered phone and reacted, “Holy shit! Who the hell did this? They must be looking to die! It’s clear someone is pulling the strings from behind. I want to see who’s got the balls to go this far!”<br/><br/>His skin flushed with anger just as the elevator opened and he walked in, “I’ll kill them, goddammit!”<br/><br/>“What are you going to do?” Daisy Zane asked, closing her phone.<br/><br/>“Go back to Celestial Pivot and find the mastermind.”<br/><br/>“We have a computer here.” Daisy Zane’s cold voice made her point, as she threw her phone at him and turned towards the ward.<br/><br/>Holt caught the phone and followed her, stunned: “I’m about to pass out from anger.”<br/><br/>This time, Daisy entered the ward without knocking.<br/><br/>Upon hearing the sound, William Butch looked at the entrance.<br/><br/>Upon seeing Daisy’s expression, his heart skipped a beat, and his eyes trembled violently.<br/><br/>He was afraid of Daisy in this state.<br/><br/>Ignoring him, Daisy sat down on a chair and turned on the computer beside the bed.<br/><br/>Holt Lawrence, who was initially furious and lightheaded, decided to comfort William Butch first: “It’s alright, just keep playing.”<br/><br/>While comforting him, Daisy had already started to type rapidly on the keyboard.<br/><br/>“They didn’t use any keywords related to me when they released the message.” Daisy said.<br/><br/>“No wonder Celestial Pivot couldn’t intercept the message.” Holt said, “What do we do now, Nana?”<br/><br/>Daisy didn’t respond.<br/><br/>What was most important now was to clear Daisy’s name. But how could they prove it?<br/><br/>They didn’t have any evidence, but the others dare to talk nonsense.<br/><br/>For a girl, especially an outstanding one like Daisy, it didn’t matter whether there was evidence or not. As long as they had a mouth to talk nonsense, their purpose would be achieved.<br/><br/>So, not only would her innocence be tarnished, but her achievements and career would become things that others would say she had obtained through men and dirty methods.<br/><br/>So, what kind of strong evidence would be needed to shut everyone up?<br/><br/>Furthermore, she couldn’t provide any evidence right now.<br/><br/>“What about the messages online? Should we control them?” Holt Lawrence asked again.<br/><br/>Daisy stared at the computer.<br/><br/>In fact, it was best not to interfere with the messages online.<br/><br/>There must be thorough clarification for this matter, and they couldn’t let people think they had used some influence to forcefully suppress the news and clarify the situation.<br/><br/>However, she couldn’t stand the sight of the video online.<br/><br/>Just as she was contemplating her options, Holt Lawrence suddenly received a message.<br/><br/>A message about Charles Amos.<br/><br/>He glanced at the message on his phone, and his chest tightened abruptly, “Nana, someone’s using Charles to frame you.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
