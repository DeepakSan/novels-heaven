He looked at the driver’s seat and then at William Lane, hesitating for a moment before saying, “Brother Roy.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane, who had just opened the copilot’s car door, asked, “Have you met before?” <br/><br/>William Lane nodded, “Arthur North...” <br/><br/>William Lane seemed reluctant to mention “Arthur North” and hesitated for a moment before continuing, “He introduced us.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised her eyebrows and got into the car. <br/><br/>Amelie Quentin also got into the car and looked at Cole Amos. <br/><br/>Cole Amos looked back at her. <br/><br/>Not until the car started and traveled some distance, and Daisy Zane had navigated the destination, did the two people in the back stop staring at each other. <br/><br/>“What are you two doing?” Daisy Zane asked, “Cole, call her.” <br/><br/>“You haven’t introduced her to me yet,” Cole Amos said. <br/><br/>“She’s your Brother Roy’s sister,” Daisy Zane replied, typing a message on her phone. <br/><br/>William Lane wanted to say something because of her wording, but in the end, he didn’t say a word. <br/><br/>Instead, Cole Amos quickly responded with a smile: “Sister.” <br/><br/>Amelie Quentin: <br/><br/>“Hello, sister,” Cole Amos said. “You’re so beautiful.” <br/><br/>“You’re good-looking, too,” Amelie Quentin replied and hesitated before saying, “Just call me auntie.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane glanced at them from the rearview mirror before looking back down at her phone to send a message. <br/><br/>“Huh?” <br/><br/>“I mean, her and I...” Amelie Quentin couldn’t say the words “your mom” and pointed to Daisy Zane, “We’re friends. You call me auntie.” <br/><br/>“But you’re Brother Roy’s sister, and Uncle Clark told me to call Brother Roy.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane: <br/><br/>Daisy Zane couldn’t help but look at William Lane, who turned his head and gently smiled at her. <br/><br/>For the first time, she had a direct sense of the concept of hierarchy. <br/><br/>If she thought about it normally. <br/><br/>Arthur North would be her... Third Uncle. <br/><br/>They had a whole generation gap between them. <br/><br/>“Child, let me clarify this for you,” Amelie Quentin said, “Who makes the decisions in your family?” <br/><br/>Cole Amos pursed his lips and looked at Daisy Zane: “Mom.” <br/><br/>“And who does your Uncle Clark listen to?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s gaze fell on his hand. <br/><br/>Holt Lawrence immediately felt a burning sensation on his hand, and hurriedly pulled his hand back without finishing his sentence. He courteously smiled, “Nice to meet you, Holt Lawrence.” <br/><br/>Olivia Lane nodded her head slightly in greeting, politely saying, “Olivia Lane.” <br/><br/>William Lane watched asDaisy Zane scared Holt Lawrence’s hand away with just a glance. What had he done to have such an effect? <br/><br/>William Butch seemed to feel better when he saw Daisy Zane, but he still felt uneasy when he saw William and Olivia Lane, especially since he didn’t know who William was. <br/><br/>After exchanging soft greetings, they all entered the villa together. <br/><br/>As they entered the villa, Daisy Zane asked, “What are you doing here?” <br/><br/>“I heard you were coming, so I came back on purpose.” <br/><br/>“What a purpose, it’s just one street away.” <br/><br/>Holt Lawrence: “...At least the thought is there, right?” <br/><br/>“Can I refuse that thought?” <br/><br/>Holding his wounded heart, Holt Lawrence said, “Nana! You’re heartless!” <br/><br/>“How about we count the number of people in the group who have a bunch of emoticons?” <br/><br/>Holt Lawrence coughed lightly and walked a few steps to William Lane’s side, “Young Master Lane, do you prefer tea or something else? I’ll have someone prepare it.” <br/><br/>The group chatted in the living room for a while, waiting for their meal. <br/><br/>Olivia Lane, Charles Amos, and William Butch chatted together. <br/><br/>Holt Lawrence, William Lane, and Daisy Zane chatted together. <br/><br/>Now that William Butch was feeling much better, his thoughts of suicide had at least ceased. However, he still did not want to go to school. <br/><br/>On their way, Charles had heard from Daisy Zane about William Butch’s situation and was somewhat familiar with it. <br/><br/>While playing checkers with William Butch, Charles said, “Brother, Uncle Lawrence said that I can train with you in a few days.” <br/><br/>Lowering his head, William Butch softly hummed in agreement. <br/><br/>Olivia Lane sat behind Charles, combing his hair and changing his hairstyle twice in just a short while. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane watched from the other side, feeling that Olivia was treating Charles like a Barbie doll. <br/><br/>“Brother, don’t mind what others say,” Charles said, “They all say I look like a girl. But what’s wrong with looking like a girl? Girls are very cute. They are also great, just like boys. ” <br/><br/>Olivia laughed. <br/><br/>William Butch listened with downcast eyes. <br/><br/>Because of Olivia combing his hair, Charles’ head moved from side to side according to her strength, “Appearance, hobbies, character – none of these faults should determine whether a person is a man or not. A true man has many, many excellent qualities, from little things like caring for the family to big things like defending the country.” <br/><br/>William Lane also looked over at his words. <br/><br/>“At the very least...men who only gossip, insult, and bully others cannot be considered real men. Even if their appearance is strong, they’re not real men, they’re worthless.” <br/><br/>“You know quite a bit for your young age,” Olivia said, stroking his face., <br/><br/>“My mom taught me well,” Charles proudly said, looking at Olivia. <br/><br/>Both William Lane and Holt Lawrence turned to look at Daisy Zane. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at the two of them, paused for a moment, and then said indifferently, “I can’t help it, I’m excellent.” <br/><br/>William Lane smiled. <br/><br/>Holt Lawrence:\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
