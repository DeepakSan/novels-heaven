She had also received flowers after the previous two TV series had wrapped up, and every bouquet was different.<br/><br/>“The Youth Experience Card has expired,” Daisy Zane said distantly.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark chuckled, “Shall I drop you off at school?”<br/><br/>“Uncle Clark, have you not had enough of playing parents?” Daisy Zane turned to him.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark:<br/><br/>Daisy Zane felt his resentment, pressed her lips together to suppress the corners of her lips from curling up and refrained from looking at him.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark sucked in his breath lightly, squeezed her face, forcing her to look at him, “If I hear those two words again I’ll ”<br/><br/>“You’ll?”<br/><br/>Anisa Cooper looked at them both with wide-open eyes.<br/><br/>John Collins sat next to her, glanced at the two people in front, then turned to look at Anisa Cooper, who was full of curiosity.<br/><br/>“I’ll ” Kevin Clark looked at her, his energy slowly fizzling out. Indeed, there was nothing at the moment that could threaten her anymore. “Nevermind.”<br/><br/>John Collins:<br/><br/>Anisa Cooper got the expected response, she pressed her lips together, secretly smirking.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised an eyebrow, removed his hand from her face, and placed her hand in his. She took her cell phone with her other hand and began scrolling through her messages.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark held her hand, gently pinching her knuckles. “Where should we go?”<br/><br/>“Rose Garden,” Daisy Zane replied. “Gael Easton is still in the villa, I don’t want to see him.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark could feel that the girl was still holding grudges because of Gael’s words from the other night. “Why hasn’t he left yet?”<br/><br/>John Collins rubbed the hand he’d placed on his leg. Kevin Clark projected an aura so powerful, it’s as if he was born to be a king, which made people awe-stricken.<br/><br/>Although Anisa Cooper was also somewhat afraid of Kevin Clark, her fear dissipated significantly when Daisy Zane was around: “Lucia, do you know anyone from Easton Group? There’s very few people who can get into Easton Group. It’s making me uneasy.”<br/><br/>“The boss of Easton ” Daisy Zane turned to look at Kevin Clark.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark raised an eyebrow.<br/><br/>Anisa Cooper stretched her neck to listen.<br/><br/>“Easton Group is fine. You can rest assured,” Daisy Zane said. “In terms of the boss of Easton we’re not that close and I haven’t looked too much into it.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark gritted his teeth, the devilish expression on his face made him look like a savage wolf.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane pretended not to see.<br/><br/>“That’s good, that’s good. If Lucia says there’s no problem, then there must be no problem,” Anisa Cooper said.<br/><br/>“Where are you staying tonight?” Daisy Zane asked.<br/><br/>“We’ve booked a hotel,” Anisa Cooper responded. “But there was a problem with the booking platform’s system and our order was delayed. That’s why I brought Brother Miller along.”<br/><br/>“You can stay at my place for the few days while you’re renting a place. You have the address, just contact Wilton Edwards directly,” Daisy Zane said.<br/><br/>“No need for that, Lucia. We’ve booked a hotel for one week,” Anisa Cooper said without thinking. “A luxury couple suite.”<br/><br/>“Ahem ” John Collins was choked by his own saliva.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane was messaging Charles Amos, and upon hearing her words, she stopped typing, looking at her.<br/><br/>Once Anisa Cooper noticed that Daisy Zane had looked over, she realized what she had just said and her face turned instantly red.<br/><br/>She shrank back a little into her seat.<br/><br/>Underneath his mask, John Collins quirked up the corner of his lips and softly squeezed Anisa Cooper’s hand.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at her for two seconds, took her eyes off her, then said slowly, “Naomi, remember to let me know when you get married.”<br/><br/>Confused as to why Daisy Zane would suddenly say this, Anisa Cooper whispered, “Of course, I’ll let Lucia know. But when I passed the interview, I told Sister Emily I wouldn’t get married in three years ”<br/><br/>“When you do get married, I’ll give you a luxury couple suite,” Daisy Zane interrupted her.<br/><br/>Now, even Anisa Cooper’s neck had turned red.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
