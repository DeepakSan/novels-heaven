Mrs. Clark must be very skilled.”<br/><br/>Alex Justin had thought the same for a moment, but feeling Kevin Clark’s mood, the idea vanished immediately.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark gently stroked Charlotte Lane’s hand and was about to speak when she preempted him: “I’m sorry, but I’m not that good at playing the piano.”<br/><br/>Caroline frowned slightly, looking at Charlotte. She was trying to determine if it was true that she wasn’t good at the piano, or if she just didn’t want to compete with her.<br/><br/>Over the years, Caroline had challenged many skilled people, and naturally, she had encountered some who thought she was not up to their level, and refused to accept the challenge, making excuses to fend her off.<br/><br/>So, upon hearing Charlotte’s refusal, she instinctively thought that might be the case.<br/><br/>Just then, a soft voice broke in, seemingly harmless: “Lady Zane is too modest, how could anyone here be completely incompetent?”<br/><br/>Charlotte looked in the direction of the voice.<br/><br/>Caroline Quinn sat at the piano, her gaze shifting from Celeste to Charlotte.<br/><br/>Seeing her calm and composed, Caroline couldn’t determine if Charlotte could play or not, so she remained silent for a moment.<br/><br/>Instead, the people nearby started to talk.<br/><br/>At first, some people thought Celeste was just trying to provoke Charlotte, but after a few sentences, Celeste gave them the impression that she knew Mrs. Clark well, and that Mrs. Clark surely knew how to play the piano.<br/><br/>Furthermore, she created a relaxed and playful atmosphere.<br/><br/>“Come on, play something. Isn’t the purpose of our gathering today to exchange ideas?”<br/><br/>“Yes, yes, I’m suddenly looking forward to it.”<br/><br/>“As expected, the real masters are hidden. There are so many great talents hiding in places we don’t know.”<br/><br/>“It seems that this trip will reveal new treasures.”<br/><br/>“Someone able to make Caroline Quinn take the initiative to challenge must be very talented.”<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Upon hearing her name, Caroline pursed her lips.<br/><br/>She suddenly considered that, not only were there musicians from the Royal Court Music Academy present, but also many foreign orchestras had arrived.<br/><br/>If Kevin Clark’s wife really couldn’t play well, since they were at the Royal Court Music Academy, wouldn’t it affect the reputation of the academy?<br/><br/>“Lady Zane is now Mrs. Clark,” Celeste dragged out her playful tone, “If she doesn’t give us a musical feast today, people might say that she looks down on us commoners after marrying into the Clark family. That wouldn’t be good for the Clark family.”<br/><br/>“So, are you suggesting that the Clark family should maintain its image by performing?” Kevin Clark looked at Celeste, his voice flat.<br/><br/>Celeste met his gaze, her pupils suddenly shrinking. She pinched her own fingers, “Third Master, I’m just joking.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark ignored her and hooked Charlotte Lane’s finger.<br/><br/>Charlotte pressed his finger, glanced through the crowd at Charles Flores, who had been chatting with people in the distance, and then said to Caroline Quinn: “I’m really not very good at playing the piano.”<br/><br/>Caroline gave her an apologetic smile. Feeling sorry for her, she immediately opened her mouth and interrupted Charlotte’s words: “I’m sorry, I didn’t really want to challenge Mrs. Clark. Actually, I wanted to challenge Kevin, but I thought it would be too bold, so I wanted to start with his wife.”<br/><br/>...\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
