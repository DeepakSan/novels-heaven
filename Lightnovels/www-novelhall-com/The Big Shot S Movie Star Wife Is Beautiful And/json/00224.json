Everybody else’s attention was drawn away by the television. <br/><br/>On TV this time was another scene of Daisy Zane’s performance. <br/><br/>Her makeup was still done by Kevin. <br/><br/>A family of experts watched an amateur’s performance. <br/><br/>Kevin sat down on the side without disturbing them. <br/><br/>After a while, this scene was over, and the camera focused on someone else. Natalie Wayne said, “This girl is really good. Even though she’s an amateur, she must have put in a lot of effort. It’s hard for a professional like me to find fault.’ <br/><br/>“Right, right.” Hardy Clark nodded in agreement, “I first saw this clip online, and then watched the entire show. She’s really serious and did a long scene with no stand-ins for the long shots. She’s really great.” <br/><br/>“Yes, she has a solid foundation in dance.” Natalie Wayne commented, “She’s truly talented, and not inferior to Hardy in any way. I wonder how her singing is. ” <br/><br/>How is her singing? <br/><br/>Kevin had never heard Daisy sing. But her voice was pleasant, so her singing should be good as well. <br/><br/>“If only we had met her earlier, we could have taken her as a disciple.” Natalie Wayne lamented. <br/><br/>“I heard that Lucia... ” Hardy swallowed the word “Daisy” before continuing, “Sister Lucia is from Cold Green Village. Our family’s poverty alleviation project includes that place. If only each year when we went there for inspection we had looked for her. Maybe we would have met her earlier.” <br/><br/>“Has she always been in Cold Green Village?” Natalie Wayne asked, “Her dance foundation seems to have been learned from a young age.” <br/><br/>Kevin blinked. The origin of the little girl was still a mystery. <br/><br/>“I’m not sure about that.” Hardy said, then picked up the remote control and rewound the video, “Let’s watch it again.” <br/><br/>Natalie looked at her, “You seem to really like her.” <br/><br/>“Yes.” Hardy smiled, “I’m a fan of hers. Grandmother, you seem to like her too.” <br/><br/>“I have a good impression of her. It’s a pity she’s not fated to be part of our family.” Natalie hesitated for a moment before continuing, “But, this girl’s background is not good, and it’s really not suitable for our family.” Hardy suddenly froze upon hearing these words. <br/><br/>Arthur North also noticed Senior’s nervousness. He glanced at the entrance and then stood up: “Senior, I’m going out. I’ll take you back on my way.” <br/><br/>Senior immediately stood up: “Alright. It is getting late.” <br/><br/>“Where are you going at this hour?” Elina Clark frowned. <br/><br/>Arthur North smiled and said, “I’m going to make efforts to add a new member to our family.” <br/><br/>Arthur North was referring to the effort of courting a wife, while Elina Clark heard it as Arthur North creating a grandchild for him. <br/><br/>“If you really love her, marry her sooner.” Elina Clark said, “Don’t bully her before you’re married.” Arthur North: <br/><br/>“Did you hear that?” <br/><br/>“Do I look like that kind of person?” <br/><br/>Elina Clark looked him up and down: “You sure do. You don’t look like a good person.” <br/><br/>” Arthur North looked at his mother, hoping to find some comfort. <br/><br/>Tom Wayne said, “Your father is right.” <br/><br/>Arthur North: “......” Was that really his image? <br/><br/>Arthur North took the goldfish and sent Senior home. Then he immediately drove to Daisy Zane’s place. <br/><br/>When he arrived, Daisy Zane was in the living room, drawing on a tablet. <br/><br/>Hearing footsteps, she turned to look. Her gaze first landed on the half-baked cheese in his left hand, then on the fish in his right hand. She paused for a moment and said, “Charles Amos is asleep.” <br/><br/>“That’s fine.” Arthur North walked over and placed the half-baked cheese in front of her. “He’ll see it as soon as he wakes up tomorrow morning.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane glanced at the half-baked cheese and said, “What? Bribing me to give you a cheaper rent?” <br/><br/>Arthur North smiled, went to put the fish in the bathtub, and then walked back. He leaned down to kiss her first and said, “I do want to bribe you. But this is a <br/><br/>freebie.’ <br/><br/>Daisy Zane gently raised her eyebrows: “So where’s the actual bribe?” <br/><br/>“Me.” Arthur North whispered, “Would seduction work?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked into his eyes, her phoenix eyes gradually deepening: “That depends on Third Master’s sincerity.” <br/><br/>Arthur North moved closer to her again, his long, narrow eyes filled with deep affection as he drawled, “Whatever type of sincerity you want, I can provide..”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
