The soul of gossip was burning.<br/><br/>Hugo Clark watched her little expression, and his eyebrows moved slightly.<br/><br/>Arthur North saw James Collins’s obviously wanting to say more expression, and got up and left.<br/><br/>Hugo Clark followed closely behind.<br/><br/>“Sister, don’t you believe me?” James Collins asked.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane did not speak.<br/><br/>Damian Brown is indeed quite cool sometimes.<br/><br/>“Sister, it’s true.” James Collins said, “That day she got drunk, and she forced me.”<br/><br/>Olivia Lane’s eyes widened. This sounded like a victim’s tone.<br/><br/>“And then the next day, after waking up, she didn’t admit it.” James Collins said angrily.<br/><br/>“That’s so pathetic.” Olivia Lane muttered under her breath.<br/><br/>“She even said she hadn’t touched a man in a long time and was a bit lonely.” James Collins complained, “She asked me to forget it and not worry about it.”<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane: “......”<br/><br/>“What happened then?” Olivia Lane asked curiously.<br/><br/>“To keep her from feeling lonely and finding someone else, I moved in with her and even shared the same bed.” James Collins said proudly, “She is now my girlfriend.”<br/><br/>Olivia Lane’s mouth twitched slightly.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane rubbed her eyebrows.<br/><br/>“Sister, am I awesome or not?” James Collins asked.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane said softly, “Actually... you don’t have to tell me these details.”<br/><br/>“It’s fine. You’re not an outsider.” James Collins slumped back, “I was going to tell you anyway.”<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane didn’t say anything.<br/><br/>“Sister, we didn’t say no to relationships within the organization, right?”<br/><br/>“No.” Charlotte Lane said, “It’s not bad. This way, I can save some money.”<br/><br/>James Collins: “......”<br/><br/>“There are guest rooms on the fourth floor.” Charlotte Lane looked at him and said, “Either go take a bath or go straight to rest. Don’t stay here.”<br/><br/>“Alright.”<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>After William Lane and the others returned, they also took a day off.<br/><br/>At dinner time, everyone ate together in the restaurant.<br/><br/>“So... we have a rat in our midst,” Allonzo Hobson drawled, but with an edge to his voice.<br/><br/>“Who knew about my sister and her group coming here?” James asked while eating a crab leg.<br/><br/>There was a brief silence among them.<br/><br/>Because no one outside the family knew.<br/><br/>Even when Arthur first went to Ezekiel Santiago to ask for leave, he said it was to go to D Continent and didn’t tell the Dean about going to Mountain Sea Continent.<br/><br/>It’s not that he didn’t trust the Dean, but that the normal process for asking for leave would have been visible to others.<br/><br/>It’s the others he didn’t trust.<br/><br/>So from the first time his leave was not approved, he said he was taking Nicholson Amos to D Continent for some matters.<br/><br/>James could tell by the look on their faces that this would not be a simple matter, so he didn’t ask further.<br/><br/>“At home... very few people knew about it,” Amelie Quentin suddenly whispered.<br/><br/>Hugo replied, “Yeah.”<br/><br/>“And this person should also know when you guys wanted to come the first time,” William Lane said. “According to the timeline, it was right after your leave from the research institute was not approved, and they began preparing.”<br/><br/>“They didn’t come the first time, but they had to come eventually. The time difference gave the enemy an opportunity.” James switched to another crab leg. “At least two messages were sent by this person. And the timing was just too coincidental, giving the enemy a chance.”<br/><br/>It was indeed a coincidence, but who would have thought there would be a problem at home that would expose their whereabouts?<br/><br/>After a quiet moment, Arthur suddenly said, “Everyone here is a suspect.”<br/><br/>William Lane, Hugo, and Allonzo Hobson: “......”<br/><br/>“Not me,” James said. “I didn’t know you guys were coming. My sister called me over two days ago.”<br/><br/>Allonzo looked at Arthur and paused before saying, “You’re the biggest suspect! You want Brook Sister to worry about you, and then let Brook Sister take the people to destroy the Platinum Burke Family. You just want to hide and take it easy, you did it on purpose.”<br/><br/>“This is something Arthur could do,” William Lane nodded in agreement.<br/><br/>Hugo secretly agreed in his heart but didn’t dare to speak out for fear of retaliation.<br/><br/>“You three just roll away,” Arthur said with a laugh and a rebuke.<br/><br/>Still caught in the crossfire, Hugo: “......”<br/><br/>“It was you who started it,” Allonzo said.<br/><br/>William Lane added, “Which time wasn’t it you who started it.”<br/><br/>Charlotte listened to them talking but never said a word.<br/><br/>Clark family and Lane Family’s servants, housekeepers, and gardeners have all been carefully screened and are trustworthy, and very few people knew about this.<br/><br/>Aside from the servants, even the housekeeper in Arthur’s yard didn’t know he had come to Mountain Sea Continent.<br/><br/>As for the Lane Family, it seemed that only Aunt Cruz knew about it.<br/><br/>Of course, they cannot rule out the possibility of other hidden schemes, although the chances are slim.<br/><br/>But... the only things that could be thought of on the surface were those.<br/><br/>It’s just that no one wants to suspect, nor wants to rupture the situation, maintaining this stalemate for the time being.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
