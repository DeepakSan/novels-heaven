There’s also a separate photo of Charles Amos,” Holt Lawrence said, “The headline reads, ‘Famous Actress Gives Birth to a Child Underage.’<br/><br/>Daisy Zane felt her blood getting colder bit by bit.<br/><br/>“Because there are too many people paying attention to the recent incident, Facebook crashed,” Holt Lawrence explained, “Precisely because of this, in the absence of any keywords related to you, Celestial Pivot found the photo of Charles Amos and promptly intercepted the message.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at the message on the cell phone. The people from Celestial Pivot reported it very thoroughly to Holt Lawrence.<br/><br/>Even the code name and real name of the hacker who did this were reported.<br/><br/>“It’s Bonnie Maxwell again,” Daisy Zane said calmly.<br/><br/>Holt Lawrence didn’t say anything.<br/><br/>One after another, two messages crossed her bottom line.<br/><br/>“I’ll go clean up the mess,” Holt Lawrence said.<br/><br/>“No need, I’ll handle it myself.” Daisy Zane closed the computer, her voice cold and terrifying.<br/><br/>Holt Lawrence’s lips moved twice, but in the end, he didn’t say anything.<br/><br/>But her words also made people feel like she was unaffected by everything.<br/><br/>William Butch was silent for a while. Taking advantage of his silence, Daisy Zane sent Kevin Clark a message telling him that she was okay.<br/><br/>“I I want to challenge Nathan Ninevara.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at the cell phone, raised her eyebrows slightly, and said lightly, “So? After solving her problem, you feel successful and unentangled? Ready to die peacefully?”<br/><br/>Each sentence struck William Butch’s core, and he fell silent.<br/><br/>“I’m not in a good mood today,” Daisy Zane looked up at him, her stunning face seemingly covered with a layer of ice, “Another day, we’ll have a match.”<br/><br/>William Butch stared at her blankly and finally said, “Just now that man was LUO?”<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>“He called you Nana, you ” William Butch swallowed the rest of the sentence, as if it were a secret he had to protect, and didn’t say it out loud.<br/><br/>“Do you want to compare?” Daisy Zane looked at him and asked.<br/><br/>William Butch looked at her, clenched his fingers, and nodded heavily: “Yes.”<br/><br/>“It’s not a waste to come.” Daisy Zane stood up and answered his question, “Holt Lawrence indeed likes you a lot, but saving you has nothing to do with Celestial Pivot.”<br/><br/>William Butch looked up at her, his forehead’s soft hair sliding to both sides, looking a little silly and well-behaved.<br/><br/>“There was someone important to me I couldn’t save her,” Daisy Zane said softly, “So I want you to live.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
