Then he went to the washroom to take a shower himself.<br/><br/>By the time he came out, Daisy was already asleep.<br/><br/>As usual, she was wrapped in the quilt.<br/><br/>Kevin walked to the side of the bed, gently pulling down the quilt. Then he stretched his hand under her neck, gently turning her face straight.<br/><br/>He took a towel soaked in hot water, covered her eyes, helping to relieve her fatigue.<br/><br/>When the towel cooled down a bit, he went to the restroom to re-soak it in hot water before returning to put it back on her eyes.<br/><br/>As soon as he placed the towel on her eyes for the second time, Daisy’s mouth moved.<br/><br/>“Kevin Clark, I just need to sleep. You should sleep too.” She knew Kevin had lifted her quilt, but she was too sleepy and didn’t want to talk.<br/><br/>Kevin leaned down and kissed her lips: “Sleep, I will apply the towel for a while, then I will sleep.”<br/><br/>“Mhm.”<br/><br/>And so, Kevin changed towels five times, and his hair had dried naturally before he quietly lay down on the bed.<br/><br/>After he lay down, he saw that Daisy was sound asleep. After a while, he reached under her neck and gently held her in his arms.<br/><br/>His hand held hers, then he kissed the back of her neck before feeling content and falling asleep.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, outside the door, there was still someone waiting for Kevin to be kicked out.<br/><br/>Gael Easton waited outside for more than an hour, but there was no sign of Kevin coming out.<br/><br/>He paced around outside, rubbing off two strands of hair in frustration.<br/><br/>The more he thought about it, the more agitated and angry he became.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, he had just annoyed Daisy and didn’t dare to barge in or knock on the door.<br/><br/>That damn girl, she was really with another man! And things had gotten to this point!<br/><br/>What did he lack compared to that Clark guy?<br/><br/>As he thought about it, Gael paced around the corridor a few more times.<br/><br/>Then he took out his cell phone and looked at himself.<br/><br/>After a while, the tears in her eyes fell and wetted her pillow.<br/><br/>After another moment, she sat up, holding the cat and stroking its fur, recalling the vague dream she had just had.<br/><br/>She could only remember it had something to do with her sister, but she couldn’t recall the specifics.<br/><br/>It was just heartbreaking, painful enough to make her feel as if she were trapped in a nightmare.<br/><br/>The cat was happy to be petted, purring contentedly after a while.<br/><br/>Olivia caressed it for a while longer, then turned on the bedside lamp, got out of bed, and went to the study in her room. She brought out the scroll written by Daisy Zane, which she had tucked away in a book.<br/><br/>Since bringing it home last Friday, she had kept it hidden in the book.<br/><br/>She was afraid her brother might discover her secret, so she planned to wait until he left for the F Continent before going to her sister’s room to compare the handwriting.<br/><br/>But now, she suddenly wanted to do so very much.<br/><br/>To want and desire.<br/><br/>Picking up the scroll, Olivia checked the time. It was almost one o’clock in the morning, and her brother should be asleep by now, so he shouldn’t discover her.<br/><br/>Holding the cat in one hand and the scroll in the other, she took a deep breath and left her room.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane’s room was next to Olivia’s. Although both rooms were large, in addition to the bedchambers themselves, there was a cloakroom, a makeup room, and a study – all larger than the average bedroom.<br/><br/>Their personal spaces were quite substantial.<br/><br/>So to go from Olivia’s room to Charlotte’s room, a few extra steps were required.<br/><br/>For the first time, Olivia had the feeling of being a thief in her own home. Finally reaching her sister’s door, she looked left and right, saw no one, and quickly went in.<br/><br/>Upon entering the room, she turned on the light.<br/><br/>The room’s layout was much the same as hers, with everything left as it used to be. Clothes were replaced with new seasonal wear, and the room was regularly cleaned.<br/><br/>It didn’t look like a room left untouched for ten years but instead seemed as if someone had just stayed there last night and was out for the evening without returning.<br/><br/>Olivia quickly scanned the room and headed straight for the study.<br/><br/>Arriving at the desk, she stood for a moment, then opened the drawer and took out all the copies of her sister’s handwriting.<br/><br/>She placed the writing samples on the left and the scroll on the right.<br/><br/>Olivia carefully examined the handwriting, even turning on the desk lamp for better light.<br/><br/>After looking through the writing samples, she found several more scrolls written by Charlotte Lane, and carefully compared them with Daisy Zane’s scroll again.<br/><br/>After the comparison, her hand resting on the desk clenched into a fist. She gazed at the two scrolls for a long time.<br/><br/>Then, whether due to weak legs or an unsteady center of gravity, she suddenly fell onto the chair behind he\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
