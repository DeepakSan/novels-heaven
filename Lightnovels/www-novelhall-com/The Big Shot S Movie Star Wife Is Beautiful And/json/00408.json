She ate less during lunch, so he was worried that she would be hungry.<br/><br/>Uncle Edwards went to rest, whereas Charles Amos stayed with Natalie Wayne in the front courtyard.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark and Daisy Zane had another meal together in a gazebo.<br/><br/>“Are you staying here tonight?” asked Kevin Clark.<br/><br/>“Yes,” said Daisy Zane, “If you have something to do, go ahead. I’ll be fine here.”<br/><br/>“I don’t have much to deal with, just some stuff in my study.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn’t speak anymore and just quietly ate her food.<br/><br/>“How are you planning to handle Amelia Miles?” Kevin asked.<br/><br/>Amelia Miles was, after all, a different kind of existence, so he didn’t want to make decisions for her or help her handle matters.<br/><br/>He was afraid that the little girl might want to keep Amelia Miles’ face.<br/><br/>“After the dance competition.” Daisy said calmly.Geett the latest novels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om<br/><br/>No matter the outcome of the dance competition, this period of time was considered as the last favor she would give to Amelia Miles’ face.<br/><br/>“Hmm. With Bonnie Maxwell arrested, Amelia Miles will be well-behaved for now.” Kevin Clark said.<br/><br/>“It doesn’t matter. She can continue acting.” Daisy Zane said, “I will settle the score with her one by one when the time comes.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark lightly raised his eyebrows.<br/><br/>After finishing their meal, Kevin went to his study room.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane went back to her bedroom, but didn’t sleep. Instead, she worked on a script.<br/><br/>Edward North, Kevin Clark’s second brother.<br/><br/>The second brother who was never mentioned.<br/><br/>“Edward was a soldier at the border. During a mission he was killed.” Tom Wayne said softly, “They said he was shot in the chest and rolled down the Snoro Mountain. By the time they went to search for him, he was already gone. In the vast snow-covered mountain, no one knew where he was buried.”<br/><br/>Gone without a trace.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at the delicate and elegant woman in front of her, paused for a moment, and gently grasped her hand.<br/><br/>Tom Wayne felt her hand and came back to her senses, she turned and smiled at Daisy before continuing, “Kevin and his second brother had always been close. It might be because Nathan North was older and had started a family earlier. Kevin and Edward were closer. So, Edward’s death was a huge blow to him.”<br/><br/>“Kevin locked himself in his room for a week and never went to the M Continent. After that, the piano he had always used was put into the storage room. Alex Justin tried to persuade him almost every day, but in the end, he never convinced Kevin to come back.”<br/><br/>Tom Wayne said, “After that some rumors about Kevin spread in the Imperial Capital. All of them were bad. And Kevin gave all his shares in the Clark Family to Enamel Cannon. To this day, we still don’t know what Kevin is doing. His time at home becomes less and less, and sometimes he only comes back once a year during the Chinese New Year. From the rumors he’s just idling around.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane thought about the things being secretly researched by the Easton Group.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark wanted to use intelligent technology and robots to replace border soldiers to the greatest extent.<br/><br/>Not just robots patrolling or attacking to a certain extent.<br/><br/>He wanted to enhance defenses and reduce casualties.<br/><br/>He aimed to adapt to various harsh environments, accurately locate enemy positions in vast snowy areas, or effectively guard against and identify any dangerous actions in time to stop them.<br/><br/>Many intelligent technologies have been applied to the border now, but they still need to be more advanced.<br/><br/>The Easton Group was working on advancement, continuous innovation, and strengthening.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark could not go to the border to replace Edward North.<br/><br/>Because his parents had already lost Edward.<br/><br/>He couldn’t go to the border and let his parents worry every day.<br/><br/>So he chose a different approach.<br/><br/>He chose another way to protect what Edward North had been guarding.<br/><br/>And it seemed like he had completely separated himself from the Clark Family. In this way whatever he did, it had nothing to do with the Clark Family.<br/><br/>“Daisy ” Tom Wayne held Daisy Zane’s hand and felt a thin callus on her fingers, which should be formed from frequently holding a gun. She looked at Daisy and said, “I didn’t mean anything by telling you all this. I just want to say I’m not sure what you and Kevin are doing. But I just want you two to be safe. Nothing is more important than your lives.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at her.<br/><br/>“Promise me, no matter when, you and Kevin must put your own safety first, okay?” Tom Wayne said.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane hesitated for a moment and finally said, “Okay.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
