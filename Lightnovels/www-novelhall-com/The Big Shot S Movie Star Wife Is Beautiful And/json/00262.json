Today, he didn’t even move. <br/><br/>Michael Jackson was curious, so he couldn’t help but take a few more glances at him. <br/><br/>He didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, except for Third Master unbuttoning his shirt two buttons while still staring at the screen. <br/><br/>Michael Jackson: <br/><br/>They had all been following Kevin Clark for a long time, but rarely could they figure out his thoughts. <br/><br/>But judging from the action of unbuttoning his shirt, Third Master seemed to be feeling hot. So, Michael Jackson kindly lowered the car’s temperature by two degrees. <br/><br/>However... What was he looking at that made him feel hot? <br/><br/>Assistant Jackson couldn’t figure it out. <br/><br/>At the school, their group of eight was divided into two groups of four per class, except for George Dunn <br/><br/>George Dunn bribed the Director so that no matter which class Daisy Zane was in, he would be assigned to that class as well. <br/><br/>Three of the boys, along with Serena Buster, ended up in Senior Three Class Fifteen. Daisy Zane, George Dunn, Celeste Martin, and Turner Daniel were in Senior Three Class Sixteen. <br/><br/>Both homeroom teachers were women. Class 15’s teacher was an English teacher, and Class 16’s teacher was a math teacher. <br/><br/>After receiving their students at the entrance of the teaching building, the teachers took them back to their offices since the morning self-study session was almost over. <br/><br/>They handed out textbooks, school rules, class rules, and explained some discipline policies in the office. They also introduced the students to other subject teachers... <br/><br/>The time after morning self-study was for breakfast. There was a relatively long break. <br/><br/>So the teachers chatted with the students while eating their breakfast. <br/><br/>“Teacher Skyler, taking your students to the classroom?” The opening remark was sarcastic. <br/><br/>Skyler Thomas glanced at her and forced a smile, “Yes.” <br/><br/>“Then hurry, every second counts in Senior Three.” The teacher spoke while her eyes swept over the four of them, “Don’t waste time.” <br/><br/>Everyone could tell that her reference to wasting time wasn’t really about being here, but more pointing to something else. <br/><br/>While speaking in front of them, she was probably referring to their show recording. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane glanced at the class name on the door: Senior Three Class Eight. <br/><br/>Perhaps out of concern for the camera, Skyler Thomas still smiled and said, “Ms. Elizabeth, you’re busy, we’ll leave first.” <br/><br/>After speaking, she led them away. <br/><br/>Ms. Elizabeth watched them leave from the doorway. <br/><br/>Only after they were far away did she remove her mask and mutter, “These ancestors were crappy to begin with, and now they have this pointless thing for two weeks. They really think they’re saviors.” <br/><br/>When they arrived at the classroom, the cameraman didn’t need to follow <br/><br/>anymore. <br/><br/>Standing at the entrance to capture their arrival, the camera guys quietly retreated to one side. <br/><br/>As soon as Skyler Thomas led them in, the class first erupted into applause, some cheers, and some banging on desks. <br/><br/>It looked very enthusiastic. <br/><br/>After all, George Dunn’s influence was evident, with fans everywhere. <br/><br/>Celeste Martin and Turner Daniel smiled as they waved slightly to greet everyone. George Dunn also had a smile on his face. <br/><br/>But before he laughed, he covered his mic, prompting Daisy Zane to laugh as well. <br/><br/>But, inexplicably, there was nothing really funny. Daisy Zane could only manage to make herself look a little less indifferent. <br/><br/>As the others interacted, she stood quietly to one side observing the people in the class. <br/><br/>Then, by the window, she saw Olivia Lane. <br/><br/>Olivia Lane, dressed in a school uniform, leaned against the back of her chair, twirling a pen in her hand, and watched Daisy Zane. <br/><br/>She had the air of a small-time gangster boss. <br/><br/>But when Daisy Zane met her gaze, Olivia Lane immediately straightened her body, averted her eyes, and looked out the window. <br/><br/>Her twisted head seemed to tell Daisy Zane, “Don’t flatter yourself, I’m not looking at you!” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at Olivia Lane and gently raised the corner of her mouth..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
