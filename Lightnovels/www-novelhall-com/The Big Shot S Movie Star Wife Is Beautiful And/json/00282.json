I can’t keep my eyes open.”<br/><br/>As soon as she finished speaking, Daisy Zane heard the steady sound of breathing. She had fallen asleep...<br/><br/>Daisy Zane glanced at her, opened the chat, scrolled through the messages, and sent a message imitating her tone.<br/><br/>A voice message quickly responded from the other side.<br/><br/>Without listening, Daisy Zane put her cell phone on her bed, touched her face again, then went down the stairs, sat at the desk, and waited for the others to leave together.<br/><br/>The English teacher was in charge of today’s morning self-study, and she was the homeroom teacher of the neighboring 15th Class.<br/><br/>By the time the three of them arrived at their class, almost everyone had already arrived.<br/><br/>The teacher came early, too.<br/><br/>Some people had even arrived more than half an hour earlier.<br/><br/>Some were memorizing words, and some were writing English papers.<br/><br/>When Daisy Zane took her seat, the bell for morning self-study rang.<br/><br/>She put a glass she had brought from the dormitory on her desk and glanced at the empty seat in front of her — William Butch hadn’t come.<br/><br/>She didn’t care too much and flipped through the extra new papers on her desk, picked an English paper, and started writing with a pen.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane wrote two papers within the forty-minute morning self-study.<br/><br/>After class, it was time to eat. She hadn’t planned to eat at first, but then remembered she still had to take her medicine, so she took her glass and went to the cafeteria with the others.<br/><br/>It was crowded in the early morning cafeteria, as everyone was in a rush due to the short time.<br/><br/>Although she didn’t speak, George Dunn saw the contempt in her eyes, “Come on, haven’t we also cooperated for so many years? Don’t we have a tacit understanding in providing revision suggestions?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane blew on the hot steam from the glass, “Compared to you, I trust Morris more.”<br/><br/>George Dunn:<br/><br/>They chatted casually for a bit, and when Daisy Zane finished drinking her medicine, the two of them went back to the classroom together.<br/><br/>The classroom was on the third floor, with long corridors and ten classes on each floor.<br/><br/>The staircases were on both sides of the corridor, with restrooms on each side as well.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane and George Dunn came up from the staircase closer to the 16th Class.<br/><br/>As soon as they reached the third floor, they heard a commotion coming from the nearby restroom.<br/><br/>First, there was the sound of something like plastic material falling on the ground, followed by a very faint muffled noise.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane and George Dunn stopped simultaneously and 1001Qd m tne direction of the restroom.<br/><br/>While they were still wondering what had made the noise, a distinct slap sound reached their ears.<br/><br/>Then there were low voices cursing.<br/><br/>From the sound of it, several male students were talking.<br/><br/>“Little bitch, didn’t I tell you, don’t let me see you in the men’s restroom again?<br/><br/>How the fuck did you get in here again? Are you asking for a beating?”<br/><br/>“Crying, crying, crying, all you do is cry like a little bitch.”<br/><br/>“Weren’t you fond of carrying a pink backpack? Why aren’t you carrying it now?<br/><br/>A man who actually likes pink, why don’t you wear a skirt, too? Hahahaha..”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
