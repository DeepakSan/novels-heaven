This smell could pierce the sky in an instant. She frowned slightly.<br/><br/>Charles Amos immediately covered his mouth and nose with his hand, then moved closer to Kevin Clark: “How about you take me away first?”<br/><br/>“You want to abandon the little girl and run away?” Kevin Clark asked.<br/><br/>Charles Amos’s big eyes flickered for a moment, and he immediately stopped talking.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the living room, hearing people talking at the entrance, the man inside shouted at once: “Who’s talking? Who’s outside?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane closed her eyes upon hearing this voice and entered the living room.<br/><br/>Upon entering, she saw the strange uncle that Charles Amos had mentioned.T/his chapter is updated by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m<br/><br/>The strange uncle sat on the sofa, his body erect in a well-tailored white three-piece suit. His hairstyle featured a long wolf-like tail, with shorter hair in the front and longer hair at the back reaching down to his ribs.<br/><br/>His eye sockets were somewhat deep, his pupils light, and his facial features three-dimensional. His appearance was a blend of East and West.<br/><br/>With a cold and sharp look in his eyes, he resembled an iceberg, especially with his light-colored pupils.<br/><br/>Of course, that was if you ignored his stinky tofu in hand and him talking.<br/><br/>This strange uncle was none other than the man Daisy Zane had mentioned, who was second only to Kevin Clark in her heart, Gael Easton.<br/><br/>He was also one of the heirs of the Monarch Dynasty of M Continent.<br/><br/>Such a noble identity, yet he was eating stinky tofu in someone else’s house and causing their child to flee the house due to the smell at night.<br/><br/>When the two groups saw each other, a temporary silence ensued.<br/><br/>This silence seemed to dilute the stinky tofu smell in the living room.<br/><br/>Gael Easton’s gaze passed over Daisy Zane and fell on Kevin Clark. His undisguised scrutiny gradually turned hostile.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kevin Clark stared back at him, his hostility even more evident.<br/><br/>For the first time, Kevin Clark saw the word “threat” in a man’s eyes. At least in the eyes of the little girl, this man was a significant threat.<br/><br/>The silence and gunpowder aroma continued.<br/><br/>Kevin looked at him, his expression becoming slightly interesting, but didn’t say anything.<br/><br/>Gael nodded, licked his lips, and finally sneered, “Stinky girl, what’s wrong? Is Mrs. Clark more honorable than you being the Monarch Dynasty of M Continent Royal Duchess?”<br/><br/>Kevin’s eyes narrowed a little, and after a pause he said, “Gael Easton?”<br/><br/>“Yeah, what’s up! Are you scared?”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark chuckled softly, his voice not loud but powerful, “Only when you have real power, can you have the qualifications to discuss your dignity with me.”<br/><br/>Gael was stunned for a moment, not expecting him to blatantly poke at his sore spot, “What the actual fuck?”<br/><br/>Kevin didn’t bother with him anymore, leading Daisy upstairs.<br/><br/>Gael watched their hands intertwined and it stung his eyes. He followed them, muttering, “Stinky girl. Is there something wrong with your eyes? You’ve got me, a man with good looks, a figure, money, and power, but you choose a playboy.”<br/><br/>Daisy pressed her throbbing eye and said calmly, “Yeah, I want to see who’s trashier between us.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark heard this and raised the corner of his mouth.<br/><br/>Gael frowned, “No, look at me, look at me. Look at my face, a handsome man you only meet once in a thousand years, don’t you have a crush? How many young men and women have followed me unconditionally?”<br/><br/>Daisy clenched her fists.<br/><br/>Wilton Edwards coughed gently downstairs.<br/><br/>Charles Amos’s small face twitched as well.<br/><br/>“Look at my figure, wide shoulders, thin waist, long legs, eight-pack abs, amazing to touch.” Gael continued, “Where did your eyes go? You didn’t choose me, such a perfect man, and picked an old hand in relationships.”<br/><br/>Kevin looked at Daisy, and although he didn’t say anything, his eyes seemed to be asking: Can I hit him?<br/><br/>Daisy squeezed his hand back, trying to appease him with great patience.<br/><br/>Kevin sighed in his heart, quickened his pace, and led Daisy back to the room.<br/><br/>Upon entering the room, just as the door was about to close, Gael slapped the door unbelievably, “What are you doing? Why are you going into the same room? I won’t allow it!”<br/><br/>“What right do you have to disallow it?” Kevin’s voice was icy. If it weren’t for saving face for this little girl, he would have taken care of Gael right there in the living room.<br/><br/>“On the grounds that I ascertained her to be my future Monarch Dynasty of M Continent Royal Duchess.”<br/><br/>Kevin laughed lightly, “Gael Easton, keep her out of your messy M Continent affairs. Don’t think I don’t know what you’re thinking.”<br/><br/>Gael crossed his arms and leaned against the door frame, his deep eyes full of chill, “That’s none of your business, is it?”<br/><br/>“I’m her legitimate boyfriend and will be her lawful husband in the future. Everything related to her concerns me too,” Kevin said, “If you dare to involve her, I promise to make M Continent a mess.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
