This is my mobile number...]<br/><br/>Charlotte sat by the bathtub and dialed Jessica’s number first.<br/><br/>Seeing Kevin’s frown, Lila tried to pull her hand back by moving her wrist.<br/><br/>But suddenly, Kevin tightened his grip, and she couldn’t pull back.<br/><br/>“I accidentally bumped into it,” Lila said in a low voice, “It’s not serious, and the wound is not deep.”<br/><br/>Kevin looked at her, redness around the corners of his eyes, his gaze fierce. “Do you think I’m blind?”<br/><br/>Lila: “......”<br/><br/>“I’m really fine,” Lila emphasized again.<br/><br/>Because of her nonchalant attitude, the fierceness in Kevin’s eyes deepened, and he called out her full name, “Lila Campbell....”<br/><br/>After calling her name, he couldn’t quite bring himself to say the rest of the words and swallowed them back.<br/><br/>Suddenly hearing her full name, Lila stared at Kevin, blinking blankly for a moment.<br/><br/>Once again, they stared at each other.<br/><br/>Lila suddenly calmly said, “Kevin Clark, you’re so fierce.”<br/><br/>Kevin pressed his lips together, looked at her for a moment, then stood up straight, turned around, picked up his phone, and made a call: “Thomas Firway, get a doctor to come to Clark Manor.”<br/><br/>After hanging up, Kevin exhaled softly, turned back around, picked up the hairdryer, and continued to help her dry her hair.<br/><br/>As the hum of the hair dryer filled the room, Kevin’s fingers brushed through her hair.<br/><br/>Lila lowered her gaze, feeling Kevin’s gentle touch.<br/><br/>After a while, she rested her head against Kevin’s body, inhaling the scent of eaglewood on him.<br/><br/>Though it was the same eaglewood scent, she always found the one on Kevin more pleasant and comforting.<br/><br/>Earlier, she had just been unable to calm down, and her hand had been hurt unintentionally.<br/><br/>Kevin’s expression stiffened for a second, and in a moment, he gently touched her face before continuing to dry her hair.<br/><br/>Once her hair was dry, Kevin squatted down in front of her and looked up at her.<br/><br/>Apart from the redness around his eyes, the fierceness was gone, and his voice had softened: “Tell me, what’s wrong?”<br/><br/>Lila looked at him, and after a while, she said, “The dean’s illness is well controlled, and his condition is very good. It shouldn’t be like this.”<br/><br/>As Lila spoke, a tear fell from her eye and dropped straight to the ground.<br/><br/>When she started to cry, Kevin suddenly panicked: “Little girl...”<br/><br/>“We should have been more cautious,” Lila said with a blank expression, her voice still distant and calm.<br/><br/>If it weren’t for the tears, it would be difficult for those unfamiliar with her to sense any fluctuation in her emotions.<br/><br/>“We’ve already done our best,” Kevin comforted her.<br/><br/>“We could have waited for the special medicine,” Lila said, burying her face in Kevin’s shoulder.<br/><br/>Kevin held her, stroking her head. Feeling the damp warmth on his shoulder, the corners of his eyes grew redder: “That’s enough, little girl, don’t cry anymore.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
