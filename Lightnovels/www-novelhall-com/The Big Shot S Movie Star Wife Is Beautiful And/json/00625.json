Kevin Clark! You’re doing this trick! You’re not playing fair!” William Lane said.<br/><br/>What responded to him was the shouts of the primitive human crowd.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thomas Firway and Juan Wright were throwing golden beans everywhere.<br/><br/>The two sides were intertwined. Kevin Clark’s crew clung to the door blockers and began to bounce. In the end, those responsible for blocking the door gave up struggling and actively jumped along with them.<br/><br/>Such a joyous occasion.<br/><br/>“They’re here! They’re here! They’re here!” Anisa Cooper reported from the entrance, “Young Master Lane didn’t stop him, the people downstairs have defected. Third Master’s already coming up! He’s coming up!”<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane almost choked and immediately put down her bowl, and Hill Dawson quickly made her up with lipstick.<br/><br/>“Fan, fan.” Stella Edwards handed her a fan.<br/><br/>When Kevin Clark and his group reached the second floor, they suddenly became gentlemanly, putting away their wild primal acts.<br/><br/>The door was knocked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No noise entered his ears from the hustle and bustle around him. In his eyes, there was only Charlotte Lane.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane occasionally puts on makeup in her free time, but she has never worn red lipstick before.<br/><br/>She was stunningly beautiful, rendering people unable to shift their gaze away.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark thought that Charlotte Lane was both a cold lotus and a dazzling rose.<br/><br/>Seeing him staring at her, Charlotte Lane smiled and said, “Third Master is exceptionally handsome today.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s brows and eyes softened into a smile. After getting close, he first bent down to kiss Charlotte Lane’s lips: “Madam, you’re exceptionally beautiful every day.”<br/><br/>Anisa Cooper and others who had been watching were all staring wide-eyed.<br/><br/>“Ahem. Third Uncle. Let’s play chess, play chess.” Amelie Quentin reminded.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane laughed and reached out to wipe the lipstick off his lips.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The two of them were playing Go while the side was bustling. Finding shoes, creating chaos, laughing and joking.<br/><br/>Soon the entire Go board was filled up, but no winner was decided yet, and the shoes still haven’t been found.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark knelt on one knee on the ground and looked up at Charlotte Lane in a pitiable manner: “Madam.”<br/><br/>“No cheating!” Logan said from the side.<br/><br/>“No beauty pageants!” Siera Santiago said.<br/><br/>“Oh no, oh no, oh no.” Damian Brown said, “Big Boss is for this trick.”<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane looked at Kevin Clark, laughed after a short while, and made her move.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark looked at the chessboard, also gave a smile, and placed the black piece, forming a line with five pieces.<br/><br/>Those on the side began to cheer.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, those looking for shoes began a carpet search. Thomas Firway and Juan Wright were looking for shoes while stuffing golden beans into their arms.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
