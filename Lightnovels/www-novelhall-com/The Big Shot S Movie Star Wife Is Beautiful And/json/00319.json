What’s going on? Wearing a shirt, what kind of fetish is this, playing this wild? <br/><br/>As for Kevin, he restrained his breathing and movements, not daring to look into Daisy’s eyes for fear that he would lose control. <br/><br/>The shirt was large enough to completely cover her thighs, buttoning up each button one by one. Kevin then touched Daisy’s face and kissed her again. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane smiled and glanced at the computer on the tea table. <br/><br/>Kevin must have some crucial matters to deal with, otherwise, he rarely worked while spending time with her. <br/><br/>Even though she didn’t want to move and wished for time to stand still at this moment, she <br/><br/>She straightened her body, stood up, her voice still emotionless as ever, “Go to sleep.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark also got up and followed her upstairs. He sent her to the door of her room, kissed her and said, “Good night.” <br/><br/>“Mm, good night.” <br/><br/>After Daisy entered the room, Kevin Clark stayed outside for a while. Then he went downstairs, picked up his computer, and headed to the laboratory. <br/><br/>The next day, just past seven o’clock, Daisy Zane was awakened by her cell phone ringing. <br/><br/>She covered herself entirely with the quilt, hearing the phone ring, stretched out her hand from under the quilt and grabbed her phone inside the blanket. <br/><br/>“What’s going on?” <br/><br/>“Lucia, you’re not awake yet?” <br/><br/>When Daisy heard Emily Dawson’s voice, she opened her eyes and lifted the quilt to check the time, “Sister Emily, what’s the matter?” <br/><br/>“This morning, a series of photos were released. They were of you and Third Master.” Emily Dawson said directly. “They must have been taken last night.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s eyes instantly changed from hazy to icy cold, “Did they capture Kevin Clark?” <br/><br/>“No, they only caught his back and a side profile. The side profile also had his facial features blurred. But your image is very clear.” Emily Dawson said, “Moreover, they captured him pinching your cheek.” <br/><br/>Emily’s meaning was that someone was trying to expose their relationship, and denying it wouldn’t hold any ground. <br/><br/>As long as they didn’t capture Kevin Clark, she didn’t care much, “Just handle it casually.” <br/><br/>“The day after tomorrow, your new drama will premiere.” Emily Dawson said, “My suggestion is to let it go for now. With the promotion of your new drama, let everyone think you made up the scandal on purpose to garner attention.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane frowned slightly, her subconscious not wanting to use Kevin Clark as a tool. Once she realized this, she chuckled, initially allowing him to get close to her so she could use him. <br/><br/>“Sister Emily, I’ll get our marriage certificate early next month.” <br/><br/>“Mm.” Emily Dawson replied, it took her a moment to register what she heard. She had spoken so casually, like she was telling Emily what she had eaten in the morning, without any emotional ups and downs. <br/><br/>Emily Dawson was silent for a moment, then raised her voice in shock, “What?!” <br/><br/>“Sister Emily, don’t set me up as a single person.” Daisy Zane said, “I will make it public.” <br/><br/>Emily Dawson remained silent for a while, then asked with a trembling voice, “Are you serious?” <br/><br/>“Mm.” Daisy Zane replied softly, “It’s being responsible for my fans.” <br/><br/>And also being responsible to Kevin Clark. <br/><br/>How could Emily Dawson not understand her meaning? She was asking her to prepare a public relations plan in advance and take a closer look at the leak today. <br/><br/>“Alright, I got it.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
