Lying on the ground, he looked at the girl, who easily managed to take them all down.<br/><br/>And she seemed especially ruthless with them, as if she was trying to take their lives.<br/><br/>Leaning against the wall and trembling, Daniel asked, “What do you want? We have no grudges against each other. Why are you treating us like enemies?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane said, “Although I prefer peace, sometimes, using force can solve many problems. Like when your personal safety is threatened.”<br/><br/>William Butch’s constantly trembling hand gradually steadied a bit.<br/><br/>“You have to learn to fight back, the strong never get bullied.” Daisy Zane said, as she gave Daniel Brown another hit.<br/><br/>And this time, she didn’t stop.<br/><br/>She immediately followed up with another blow. Since William Butch wasn’t resisting now, this hit was even harder than the previous four combined.<br/><br/>Daniel Brown directly covered his face and slid down against the wall, sitting on the ground.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane let go of William’s arm, then walked towards Daniel Brown again.<br/><br/>When William’s arm was released, it hung down by his side. The warmth in his palm was familiar, the same warmth as when he gets hit on the face.<br/><br/>Except today, he hit someone else.<br/><br/>Seeing her approach, Daniel Brown suddenly burst into tears, covering his face and crying, “I was wrong, I won’t ever hit or bully people again, I know I was wrong.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked down at his tear-soaked face and asked, “Why did you target Daisy Zane?”<br/><br/>Marsh Turner’s expression shifted as he looked at her silhouette. He thought, is she Daisy’s friend? Did she come here for Daisy?<br/><br/>Daniel Brown was frightened, understanding that if he didn’t speak up, he would be beaten even worse. He said with a sob, “I don’t...I don’t know. A girl suddenly came to me.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane listened quietly.<br/><br/>“W-we often hang around near the school, and that girl suddenly approached us. She asked us to find a way to bring Daisy Zane out,” Daniel Brown continued, “She wanted us to take Daisy Zane under surveillance in the forest at Forest Park so they can capture some inappropriate videos of her. The woman also said we could make it extreme, to capture more, make it scandalous.”<br/><br/>Listening to this, William Butch looked down and pursed his lips.<br/><br/>Marsh Turner walked over and kicked Daniel Brown, “Have you grown too courageous? How dare you mess with anyone! You were lucky not to die at noon!”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane glanced at Marsh Turner and continued in a male voice, “Did you see the girl’s face?”<br/><br/>“No,” Daniel Brown moved a little further away from Marsh Turner and said, “She was very well wrapped up, tighter than you, not even her fingers were exposed.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane fell silent for a moment, then asked, “When did she approach you?”<br/><br/>After thinking for a while, Daniel Brown said, “On...Sunday evening. She also gave us a huge suitcase, filled with cash.”<br/><br/>Marsh Turner cursed and said, “So why did you guys go after William Butch?”<br/><br/>Daniel Brown was even more scared, moving further away and looking at the person lying on the ground. “We often eat together with people from your school. I told them about this, asking them to help bring Daisy Zane out. They seemed to have a grudge with Daisy Zane and agreed very quickly. And then they found William Butch.”<br/><br/>Daniel Brown sniffed and continued, “But this William Butch seems weak and easy to bully, but he is stubborn. No matter how much we hit him, he wouldn’t take us to Daisy Zane.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
