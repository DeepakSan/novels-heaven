She was touched when she realized the water had sugar in it – it was sugar water.<br/><br/>Fang Hong looked up at Lu Jun, unable to hide her gratitude from her eyes.<br/><br/>Lu Jun nodded without saying anything, as his partner had dysmenorrhea. They had been to the doctor together about it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He remembered the doctor saying that brown sugar water could help relieve period pain, so he often prepared it for her, hoping she’d feel more comfortable.U//ppTodated fr/o/m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)\\/m<br/><br/>Lu Jun recalled a time when his partner hadn’t eaten breakfast and fainted. The doctor said it was because of low blood sugar from skipping breakfast, and told him to buy sugar to dissolve in water for her to drink.<br/><br/>After finishing the water, Fang Hong took the customer’s order and went to Mr. Guo’s office.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“Mr. Guo, here is the customer’s order.” When Fang Hong arrived at the office, only Guo Aiguo was there writing something. She knocked on the door and went in.<br/><br/>“Fang Hong, you’re here! You settled the deal so soon? Great!” Guo Aiguo was pleased when he looked at the order.<br/><br/>“Fang Hong, you’re really something. You managed to win over such a difficult person,” Guo Aiguo had heard about this customer before, who was said to be quite tough, but he didn’t expect Fang Hong to handle him so quickly.<br/><br/>“It was alright,” Fang Hong smiled and said. In fact, it was far from that; she had put in quite a lot of effort.<br/><br/>Initially, she had spent several days investigating this customer’s background, even his hobbies and interests.<br/><br/>In the end, Fang Hong found out that this customer was hen-pecked by his wife. Others might see it as hen-pecked, but in Fang Hong’s eyes, he was a man who loved his wife deeply.<br/><br/>So Fang Hong took the opportunity to get close to the customer’s wife and win him over through her. As a result, Qin Xue even became good friends with the customer’s wife.<br/><br/>Guo Aiguo didn’t know any of this, thinking everything was quite simple. Yet, Fang Hong’s efforts were not easy at all. She couldn’t tell Guo Aiguo all these details, so she simply smiled and brushed it off.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
