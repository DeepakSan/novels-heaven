To compete with you, I need to get my permission first?”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s overbearing aura around him dissipated instantly as he looked at Charlotte Lane and smiled, “Not fierce, very cute.”<br/><br/>Charles Amos blinked his big eyes twice. She was...cute...right.<br/><br/>Upon hearing the word “cute,” Charlotte Lane’s eyebrows twitched, and she wanted to retort: Are your eyes going bad?<br/><br/>People around them saw Charlotte Lane’s distant expression and heard her cold voice.<br/><br/>They thought, love really could make people blind...to see a little cuteness.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Since Caroline Quinn said that she wanted to compete with Kevin Clark, he didn’t say anything and simply sat down next to the piano.<br/><br/>He played a song that was a must-learn at the Court Music Academy.<br/><br/>It was the song that he and Charlotte Lane had seen on the wall when they came here.<br/><br/>The song was long and difficult, clearly intended for showing off one’s skills.<br/><br/>Moreover, since different people played different instruments, this song had different parts that suited the skills of different instruments.<br/><br/>The part played by Kevin Clark was perfect for showing off piano skills.<br/><br/>He sat there, looking at Charlotte Lane.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane looked into Kevin Clark’s eyes, feeling the sense of security he brought her.<br/><br/>After a while, she turned her head to look at Celeste Martin, repeating the sentence she had just said, and added what she didn’t say before, “I really don’t play the piano very well. However... I do have some knowledge of other instruments.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s eyelashes fluttered lightly.<br/><br/>Hearing her words, Amelie Quentin in the crowd behind her turned and ran towards the Court Music Academy building.<br/><br/>Roy Madison couldn’t even find the time to say “slow down.”<br/><br/>Celeste Martin’s eyes darkened, but she still asked, “Really? What instrument did Mrs. Clark learn?”<br/><br/>“Pipa,” Charlotte Lane said faintly, her fingertips by her side gently caressing, “I’ve heard that Lady Martin is very good at playing the pipa.”<br/><br/>Hearing the word “pipa,” Celeste Martin seemed stunned at first, thinking she had misheard. Then she almost couldn’t help but laugh out loud.<br/><br/>Pipa.<br/><br/>Celeste Martin felt her blood boiling and heating up.<br/><br/>This was even more exciting than seeing Daisy Zane sitting at the piano, being laughed at by those around her.<br/><br/>Because this way, she could personally pull Daisy Zane down.<br/><br/>And personally tell her that she still lost to her.<br/><br/>No matter how glorious Daisy Zane was, no matter how much she was chased after by others.<br/><br/>In the end, she still lost to her.<br/><br/>Celeste Martin’s excitement caused her skin to turn slightly red. She clenched her hands by her side and it took her a while to calm herself down.<br/><br/>But as soon as she opened her mouth, her voice was still trembling, “So... you want to compete with me in playing the pipa?”<br/><br/>“Wasn’t what I said clear enough?” Charlotte Lane replied.<br/><br/>Celeste Martin raised her chin, confidently and proudly saying, “Yes.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane, this is what you asked for, don’t blame others...\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
