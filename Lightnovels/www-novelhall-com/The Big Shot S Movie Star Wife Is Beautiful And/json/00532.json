She seemed to try to calm herself down before saying, “Daisy Zane, did you do that on purpose?”<br/><br/>“Do what on purpose?”<br/><br/>“Do what? You purposely said that you haven’t played the Pipa for many years, then suppressed me.” As Celeste Martin spoke, her breathing gradually became chaotic, as if she was losing control of herself, “If you can’t suppress me, blame it on not playing for many years. If you could suppress me, let others think, you haven’t played for so many years, yet you can still play so well.”<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane found it amusing and let out a smirk, “Celeste Martin, do you have a poor memory? This whole thing was provoked by you. You’ve always wanted to put me in that position to make a fool of myself.”<br/><br/>Celeste Martin was momentarily speechless.<br/><br/>“Moreover... I can’t lose to you, such a situation doesn’t exist.” Charlotte Lane, with an indifferent expression and a strong aura, slowly said, “I really haven’t played for many years, but suppressing you... it’s too easy.”<br/><br/>“You...” Celeste Martin was so angry that she was trembling and couldn’t say a word.<br/><br/>“This is the difference between people.” Charlotte Lane hit where it hurts, “You’ve practiced for more than twenty years and this is your height. I only practiced for a little over ten years, haven’t touched it for a few years, yet I am still at a height you can’t reach.”<br/><br/>“Daisy Zane!” Celeste Martin raised her hand as if to hit her.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane quickly grabbed her wrist and threw it away.<br/><br/>Celeste Martin stumbled back a few steps, barely keeping her balance by holding onto the washbasin.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane walked a few steps towards her, her gaze scanning the Court Music Academy name tag on her clothes.<br/><br/>Every student of the Court Music Academy has their own name tag, and today they were all wearing them on their clothes.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane grabbed the name tag, with a pull, directly yanked it off her clothes, tearing a small hole in her sleeve.<br/><br/>Celeste Martin immediately tried to get her name tag back, but failed: “Give it back to me!”<br/><br/>Charlotte Lane’s eyes were filled with frost, she held her name tag and said, “Celeste Martin, I advise you to be smarter. If you keep your head down, there will be a place for you in the Court Music Academy. But if you do something stupid like today, get out.”<br/><br/>“What right do you have to say these things to me!”<br/><br/>“Whether I have the right or not is not up to you.” Charlotte Lane quietly said, “Don’t overestimate yourself, you’re not irreplaceable. Whether you are here or not, it’s all the same.”<br/><br/>After Charlotte Lane finished speaking, she threw the name tag on the washbasin and turned to the inner part of the restroom.<br/><br/>...\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
