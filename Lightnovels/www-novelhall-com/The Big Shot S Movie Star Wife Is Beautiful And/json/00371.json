When it was renovated, it was mostly done according to her preferences and a room was intentionally left for them on the top floor.”<br/><br/>Lila<br/><br/>Daisy raised her eyebrows. Kevin had never called Olivia by this nickname.<br/><br/>At the room entrance, Kevin swiped his room card and opened the door. The two of them entered the room together.<br/><br/>There were lotus decorations in the room as well.<br/><br/>Daisy walked into the room, touching the lotus.<br/><br/>It was her idea to get the marriage certificate, and she thought they could skip the proposal.<br/><br/>However, Kevin had still carefully arranged everything.<br/><br/>Kevin approached her, stroked her head and said, “Shall we take a bath? Sleep early?”<br/><br/>Daisy turned to look at him, “Sleep early?”<br/><br/>“Yeah,” Kevin smiled and kissed her lips lightly, “Sleep early.”<br/><br/>Daisy didn’t say anything else, simply nodding her head.<br/><br/>“There are clothes in the cabinet,” Kevin said.<br/><br/>“Okay.”<br/><br/>Daisy went to take a bath while Kevin went to the balcony to call Michael Jackson.<br/><br/>Michael was handling the Davis Family’s affairs in Truro City.<br/><br/>Kevin said, “Don’t kill them all at once, leave them some breath.”<br/><br/>“Yes, Third Master,” Michael agreed.<br/><br/>Michael had followed Kevin for so many years, so he naturally understood Kevin’s intentions. Immediately killing them would mean severing their attachments.<br/><br/>But if the Davis family was left to suffer<br/><br/>They would constantly try to seek help and rescue themselves.<br/><br/>Struggling to survive, acting lowly and humiliating themselves—those were the most painful and mentally exhausting experiences.<br/><br/>For the Davis Family in Truro City, it was especially true in that place.<br/><br/>It was like falling from the clouds into a swamp.<br/><br/>Even the people and relationships that the Davis Family previously looked down on would become unreachable later.<br/><br/>Killing them all at once wouldn’t alleviate Kevin’s hatred; slow torment would help dispel his anger.<br/><br/>“How’s the Miles family doing?” Kevin asked.<br/><br/>“The Miles Family is still the same; the company can barely function, but it’s incomparable to before,” Michael Jackson said. “If it weren’t for the occasional help from the Truro City community out of respect for the Anderson brothers, they would be even worse off.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked up at him.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark was wearing a black sleeping robe, the belt wrapped around his waist, emphasizing his slim build.<br/><br/>His collarbone was exposed, with the contrast between his fair skin and the black robe creating a striking effect.<br/><br/>In his narrow eyes, there was an endless tenderness.<br/><br/>The corners of his eyes and his thin lips might be redder than usual, probably from the steam in the room.<br/><br/>His hair was wet, tossed back with a few strands hanging down in front, the ends reaching his eyebrows and occasionally dripping a few droplets of water.<br/><br/>He looked tempting, sensual, and casual.<br/><br/>As Daisy Zane looked at him, the words that Damian Brown had said suddenly crossed her mind.<br/><br/>[The Big Boss must have taken someone to bed.]<br/><br/>These words seemed to carry their own voice as they floated through her mind.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane quickly shifted her gaze and, looking down, silenced her cell phone.<br/><br/>As Kevin Clark watched her, he casually dried his hair a little more before tossing the towel onto a chair.<br/><br/>He approached her, crouched down, and asked, “Little girl, what are you thinking about?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane was blocking people out and replied without raising her head, “Nothing.”<br/><br/>“For real?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn’t respond, but after a while, she said, “Fake.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark paused, then laughed again, “So what were you thinking about?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane blocked the last person, closed her phone, and looked into his eyes, “I was thinking about experiencing the fun at Doomsday Hotel.”<br/><br/>The laughter in Kevin Clark’s eyes stiffened for a moment, his tender gaze quickly becoming filled with desire. It was as if, in that instant, they were the only two people left between heaven and earth.<br/><br/>In his eyes, there was only his little girl.<br/><br/>Seeing his expression, Daisy Zane leaned closer and whispered in his ear, “Third Master do you want to experience it together?”<br/><br/>The warm breath touched his ear, and Kevin Clark lightly rolled his throat, feeling his blood begin to heat up.<br/><br/>He licked his dry lips, closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and then looked at Daisy Zane, his voice hoarse, “You haven’t rested all day, I’m worried that you’re tired.”<br/><br/>For Daisy Zane, it had been a long day—returning to the villa early in the morning, developing a fever due to Edward Kirsten’s situation, sleeping only a few hours, then heading to the Clark Manor, the police station, and the show to record a program, arguing with someone during the afternoon. She then visited a private hospital and later arrived at the Doomsday Hotel, touring several floors. She had been on the move all day, hardly stopping to rest.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane raised an eyebrow, stroking her fingertips, her voice soft, “In that case, Third Master be gentle.”<br/><br/>It seemed as if Kevin Clark heard a sound in his body, some string snapping.<br/><br/>Countless desires crawled up his heart, reflected in his eyes.<br/><br/>When he returned to the room, he genuinely had such a thought for a moment. But after considering the little girl’s schedule for the day, he suppressed the thought.<br/><br/>Already having the idea but not determined enough, with just a little tease, the desire became a fire, connecting heaven and earth.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark found it increasingly difficult to control himself; he took a deep breath, reached out to cradle Daisy Zane’s head, and pulled her into his arms, kissing her deeply.<br/><br/>His kiss was heavy yet restrained, as if afraid of hurting her, but at the same time, a little out of control<br/><br/>Daisy Zane found herself pressed against the carpet, her mind unusually blank as her thoughts seemed to pause for a rare moment.<br/><br/>All her senses came from Kevin Clark, and she became lost in the overwhelming sensation and the feeling of sinking under his touch.<br/><br/>It wasn’t until the belt of his sleeping robe was untied, and Kevin Clark’s hot hand touched her skin, that she came back to her senses and struggled, “Kevin Clark ”<br/><br/>“Let’s go to the bed.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark kissed her for a while longer, then pressed a gentle kiss to the scar on her collarbone before carrying her to the bed.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
