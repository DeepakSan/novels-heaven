Daisy is the Chief Designer of Cloud Clothing and Rainbow Skirts?” Calvin Stewart mumbled, “Did I hear it wrong back then?”<br/><br/>Theo Clark pressed his lips together and said nothing.<br/><br/>What kind of a person did their Third Brother marry after all?<br/><br/>With the Clark Family’s social status... were they really worthy of her?<br/><br/>Wouldn’t she be wronged?<br/><br/>“It’s Shopie Easton, and also Clayson Ninevara.” Joseph Allen stood not far from them, hearing their conversation, he drew closer, and whispered.<br/><br/>Calvin Stewart stared blankly at Daisy Zane.<br/><br/>Phoebe Turner and George Hobson were also shocked.<br/><br/>What? What did they hear? What does it mean to be both Cloud Clothing and Rainbow Skirts and Clayson Ninevara? How is Sienna Perry involved?<br/><br/>What did Felix Baker just say?<br/><br/>What did Joseph Allen just say?<br/><br/>Did someone just speak?<br/><br/>Except for the insiders, everyone else was confused.<br/><br/>But even though they were confused, they all looked at Daisy Zane for the first time.<br/><br/>Amelia Miles tightly clenched her hands hanging by her side, struggling to calm her breathing, adjusting her emotions, not letting herself lose control.<br/><br/>She pursed her lips tightly, and it took her quite a while to quietly swallow and slowly exhale.<br/><br/>Why is it always her?<br/><br/>Why is it her for everything?<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Mrs. Maxwell and Jessica Maxwell were both silent.<br/><br/>Amidst their silence, even the quiet and melodious piano music seemed to have vanished.<br/><br/>Seeing this scene, Felix Baker jokingly said, “Everyone’s reaction... it seems our Chief is still more well-known than me.”<br/><br/>“Good that you know.” Kevin Clark said.<br/><br/>Felix Baker:<br/><br/>Mrs. Maxwell’s dumbfounded eyes finally moved, slowly focusing on Daisy Zane and then she said, “How could it be possible? How could she be Clayson Ninevara?”<br/><br/>“Why isn’t it possible?” Felix Baker frowned and said, “Why not possible?”<br/><br/>“You, you guys...” Mrs. Maxwell looked at Felix Baker and then at Daisy Zane, “You guys...”<br/><br/>“What? Don’t get me involved.” Felix Baker quickly said, “She is her, I am me, don’t say we. I am the Founder of Spotlight, she is the Chief Designer of Spotlight. Our relationship is purely cooperative. Don’t implicate me.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane:<br/><br/>Kevin Clark: Was he that jealous?<br/><br/>“It’s impossible, impossible...” Mrs. Maxwell still couldn’t believe it, or rather, she didn’t want to believe it.<br/><br/>“Stop saying it’s impossible, it’s so possible.” Felix Baker said, “The necklace and earrings that Best Actress Turner is wearing are the new products to be launched this year. They are from Clayson Ninevara’s hands. There will be a new series of products at the press conference next month. Otherwise...”<br/><br/>The remaining people were standing in place.<br/><br/>“No, how come you all reacted so calmly?” Hardy Clark was surprised, only to discover that the others were all quite calm.<br/><br/>They all looked at her.<br/><br/>Hardy Clark understood: “So, I’m the only one who didn’t know?”<br/><br/>The others responded with their silence.<br/><br/>“So, you guys were in the know and didn’t tell me and let me worry all by myself.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark said ruthlessly: “There always has to be someone worrying.”<br/><br/>Hardy Clark didn’t dare to refute him.<br/><br/>She looked at them one by one, only to realize that her brother was the one she couldn’t fight with, so she punched Hugo Clark.<br/><br/>Hugo Clark:<br/><br/>“Sister...”<br/><br/>The group laughed and suddenly looked at Amelia Miles.<br/><br/>Seeing everyone looking at her, Amelia Miles pursed her lips, looking at Daisy Zane, and cautiously said, “Sister, I want to have a private chat with you, can I?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at her without saying a word.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark frowned, about to speak, when Olivia Lane suddenly rushed in front of Daisy Zane, standing between her and Amelia Miles.<br/><br/>Olivia Lane glared at her: “Who are you calling sister? Who is your sister? Don’t mess with family. What’s there to talk about? What’s so good to talk about?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane was taken aback for a moment, and then she bowed her head and laughed.<br/><br/>Amelia Miles was dumbfounded by her series of words, and she didn’t dare to do anything to Olivia Lane, so she could only endure it and say, “I...”<br/><br/>But Olivia Lane didn’t give her a chance to speak, and turned around and took Daisy Zane’s hand, leading her away.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark:<br/><br/>Kevin Clark followed along.<br/><br/>Olivia Lane led Daisy Zane about six or seven meters away, then let go of Daisy Zane, walked back angrily, and dragged William Lane away.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire process, she acted as if she hadn’t seen Amelia Miles.<br/><br/>“Amelie...what happened?” asked Hardy Clark.<br/><br/>Hugo Clark remained silent, looking at Olivia Lane, thinking to himself, “Wow, why didn’t she take him away too?”<br/><br/>What if Amelia Miles had taken a fancy to him as well?<br/><br/>With this thought, Hugo Clark and Hardy Clark also left.<br/><br/>Now only Robinson Scott and Amelia Miles were left standing together.<br/><br/>Amelia Miles stood there for a while, unable to react. She initially thought that everything would go smoothly, but she didn’t expect that none of her plans would work.<br/><br/>Robinson Scott looked at her, smiled for a moment, and said, “Who have you taken a fancy to? William Lane? So, you pretended to be a good person in front of him? Feigned friendliness?”<br/><br/>Amelia Miles looked at him, her eyes full of malice: “Who are you? It’s not your turn to talk nonsense.”<br/><br/>Robinson Scott laughed again, looked Amelia up and down, and said: “It’s good to have self-confidence, but don’t overdo it. People...noxious in appearance do get extra points, but if your heart is black...don’t expect heaven to treat you kindly.”<br/><br/>After saying that, Robinson Scott left.<br/><br/>Only Amelia Miles was left standing there, her eyes full of venom as she looked in Daisy Zane’s direction.N/nêw n0vel chap/ers are published o/n n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
