Some were just concerned and asking questions, some were questioning her, and some were scolding her. <br/><br/>And soon, the most common topic was questioning why the message was removed so quickly. <br/><br/>Was she being kept by some man? <br/><br/>Was the man’s identity mysterious and noble? <br/><br/>Daisy Zane casually glanced through the messages, and seeing that they did not involve Arthur North or the Clark Family, she closed her Facebook. <br/><br/>At this time, Holt Lawrence’s call came: “Nana, your news with Arthur North was sent under the name of an 18th-tier Little Star, and Celestial Pivot did not notice it at first.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane leaned against the head of the bed, pinching her brow: “Is it to avoid being intercepted online?” <br/><br/>All major online media had been contacted by Allonzo Hobson, with some smaller media outlets following the actions of the big ones. <br/><br/>It was almost an established rule not to break any news about Daisy Zane. <br/><br/>And Celestial Pivot had people specifically monitoring online messages, checking for scattered information from fans or small media outlets that would ignore the situation and make money recklessly. <br/><br/>But this time the message had nothing to do with Daisy Zane, so Celestial Pivot did not intercept it in time. <br/><br/>Holt Lawrence: “It shouldn’t be. I traced the message on the internet. It was sent by someone named Celeste Martin, who registered an account with a black card.” <br/><br/>Hearing this name, Daisy Zane raised her eyebrows slightly. <br/><br/>Holt Lawrence continued: “She probably didn’t expect the internet to intercept news about you. She didn’t dare to expose your romance directly, so she made a detour, pretending to have mistaken someone else for you, and posted it online. It was the netizens who later said it was you.” <br/><br/>“Why bother?” Daisy Zane said. <br/><br/>“Feeling guilty, I guess. This way, she may feel a little better.” Holt Lawrence said, “I found out that she has recorded a show with you. Are you not getting along?” <br/><br/>“Maybe.” Daisy Zane looked around the layout of the room while sitting on the bed. A vase was placed on the table in the bay window, with a rose inside. <br/><br/>Bathing in the sunlight, it was vibrant and gorgeous. <br/><br/>It should have been placed there yesterday, but she hadn’t noticed it last night. <br/><br/>“You haven’t given me any news about William Butch.” Daisy Zane said. <br/><br/>“Ah, someone has been sent to inquire about the people he used to be in contact with.” Holt Lawrence said, “I will sort it out and send it to you in the evening.” <br/><br/>After hanging up the phone, Kevin Clark didn’t ask the driver to take him home. Instead, he drove back himself. <br/><br/>It must be about Henry Clark’s incident, which had reached his father’s ears. <br/><br/>He didn’t intend to hide it at all, but the news reached his father much later than he expected. <br/><br/>Driving halfway across Imperial Capital, as soon as Kevin Clark entered their front hall, he saw a room full of people. <br/><br/>Everyone from Clark Family was present, except for him. <br/><br/>The situation seemed to be just waiting for him, and it seemed to be a public execution. <br/><br/>The front hall was shrouded in gloom. His older brother, sister-in-law, and Hugo Clark were secretly signaling him with their eyes, probably asking him to say a few good words and submit. <br/><br/>Hardy Clark was also sitting nervously to one side, looking at him. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark gave his sister-in-law a reassuring look and then turned to his parents, smiling, “Dad, Mom. Family gathering today?” <br/><br/>As he said this, he was about to sit down, but before he could even touch the sofa, Elina Clark said, “You stand.” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark: ” ” <br/><br/>Natalie Wayne looked at him sympathetically but didn’t say anything. <br/><br/>Elina Clark’s expression was cold as he looked at him and asked, “Where did you send Henry Clark?” <br/><br/>“M Continent Prison.” Kevin Clark repressed the laughter in his eyes and said directly. <br/><br/>After hearing this, Theo Clark and Hugo Clark both frowned. <br/><br/>Theo Clark found out today along with his father. <br/><br/>Hugo Clark found out after his Third Uncle arrested the person. <br/><br/>However, Kevin Clark had people specifically under his command, who only took orders from him. So, Hugo Clark didn’t know where exactly Kevin Clark had sent Henry Clark. <br/><br/>M Continent Prison, an endless hell <br/><br/>It would be better to just kill the person outright. <br/><br/>“Kevin Clark! He is your Second Uncle!” Elina Clark yelled angrily. <br/><br/>“He is not.” <br/><br/>“Just because you say he isn’t doesn’t make it so. Both of you share the blood of the Clark Family. It’s not something you can disavow just because you want to!” Elina Clark slapped the table and said, “What’s the first rule of Clark Family? Tell me what it is!” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark took a soft breath and said, “The Clark Family is united, with a shared voice, shared roots, and shared hearts. Under no circumstance should brothers fight against each other or kill their own blood.” <br/><br/>“What have you done!” <br/><br/>“It was Henry Clark who made the first move.” Faced with his father’s harsh words, Kevin Clark’s tone remained calm. <br/><br/>“He attacked you so you attacked him? Just because he doesn’t understand the family rules, you don’t either? How did I teach you? How can you face your ancestors!” Elina Clark’s chest heaved violently, “The Lane Family has already decided to take action, so let them handle it. He has had sinister intentions for twenty years and hasn’t repented. Whether he lives or dies, I’m not going to get involved. But you why, why did you suddenly take action!”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
