However, her eyes were staring straight at Daisy, not appearing to be friendly.<br/><br/>“Miss Santiago, this is Mrs. Clark,” James reminded from the side.<br/><br/>The girl surnamed Santiago didn’t seem to care about James’ words and instead tilted her chin and said, “I’m talking to you.”<br/><br/>Daisy squinted her eyes but didn’t say anything.<br/><br/>Michael Jackson quickly whispered to Daisy, “She is Third Master’s old friend’s daughter. Her name is Siera Santiago and has always been on the Mountain Sea Continent.”<br/><br/>Daisy looked at the girl’s eyes for a moment, then said, “The daughter of an old friend, Arthur North ”<br/><br/>“She’s just a friend. Third Master and her had nothing.” Michael hurriedly said.<br/><br/>Daisy glanced at him.<br/><br/>Michael Jackson realized what he had just said and immediately shut up, swallowing hard.<br/><br/>“Hey, I’m talking to you! Did you not hear me?” Siera crossed her arms, staring at Daisy.<br/><br/>“I did, so what?” Daisy replied indifferently.<br/><br/>Siera looked Daisy over, scoffing, “Just this, thin arms and thin legs, a mere embroidery pillow. How can you be Third Master’s wife?”<br/><br/>James:<br/><br/>Michael Jackson touched his eyebrows. If she was an embroidery pillow, what were they? Trash?<br/><br/>“What can you do to make everyone convinced?” Siera asked. “To be the mistress of Dark Radiance, one must be worthy of the two words Dark Radiance. What can you do? Besides being good-looking and being able to act, what else can you do?”<br/><br/>“You go tell Arthur North,” Daisy took two steps towards her, looking at her and said, “Tell him I’m not worthy of him.”<br/><br/>After saying that, Daisy began to walk away.<br/><br/>As she passed by Siera, Daisy bumped into her shoulder, pushing her to stumble sideways.<br/><br/>Michael Jackson’s heart sank, and his face paled a few shades, quickly catching up to Daisy.<br/><br/>Siera was taken aback by the bump, and immediately yelled, “What are you doing? Bumping into me?”<br/><br/>James said, “Miss Santiago, that’s Third Master’s wife, why speak so harshly?”<br/><br/>“I did it on purpose. I hate those women who use their beauty to seduce men and enjoy wealth and luxury.” Siera replied, “Third Master even brought her here. This is Dark Radiance, not a place for her to bewitch.”<br/><br/>James: ” be careful, or Third Master might get angry with you.”<br/><br/>“Am I stupid? I won’t be caught by him.” Siera muttered, “It’s his fault for being bewitched by lust. I’ll scold his wife, and he deserves it.”<br/><br/>James raised his eyebrows, “I heard Third Master talking with Young Master Hobson, and Lady Zane is very powerful. Even Thomas Firway lost to her.”<br/><br/>Siera sneered, “How can that be? Thomas told me personally, she doesn’t know anything, she just drags people down. If she had really defeated Thomas, he would have been following her like a puppy by now.”<br/><br/>James wanted to say something, but before he could, Siera said first, “This must be Third Master and Young Master Hobson’s scheme to win people’s approval. You’re so gullible; you fell for it.”<br/><br/>James:<br/><br/>“Silly child.” Siera finished, going towards the martial arts arena.<br/><br/>After Daisy Zane left, she went to the indoor shooting range.<br/><br/>There was no one inside, Daisy casually picked up a gun and started shooting continuously.<br/><br/>Michael Jackson stood at the entrance, not daring to breathe and listening to the gunshots, his heartbeat getting faster with each shot.<br/><br/>Arthur North returned in less than ten minutes.<br/><br/>Having heard from people outside that they were at the shooting range, he directly went there.<br/><br/>But after seeing Michael Jackson’s nervous face outside the shooting range, he stopped and looked at him.<br/><br/>“Th-Third Master.”<br/><br/>Even though he hadn’t used all his strength, she still had no chance of winning.<br/><br/>The gap wasn’t just a little.<br/><br/>She knew her weaknesses when facing someone stronger than herself.<br/><br/>So when attacking, she used her legs more. Using the strength of her legs to enhance her attacks.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s legs were powerful, and the wooden post at the edge of the podium was kicked and snapped by her in two hits.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark had fought with her back in D Continent and was naturally aware of her strength. However, he felt that she had become somewhat stronger.<br/><br/>Her endurance was also astonishing.<br/><br/>After more than twenty minutes, Daisy Zane’s hand was caught.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark used his strength to twist her hand behind her back without hurting her and pressed her other hand in front of her.<br/><br/>He stood behind her, as if his arm was wrapped around her in a circle.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane struggled for a moment, but couldn’t break free. She stopped and clicked her tongue softly: “Still didn’t win.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark chuckled and didn’t let her go: “Little girl, wasn’t that a bit too much before we started fighting.”<br/><br/>“Which one?” Daisy Zane knowingly asked.<br/><br/>“The one about not having a wife if I can’t beat you.”<br/><br/>“Didn’t you win?” Daisy Zane countered.<br/><br/>“What if I didn’t?” Kevin Clark said softly, “Little girl, you’ve improved.”<br/><br/>“If I didn’t win ” Daisy Zane tilted her head to look at the sweat on Kevin Clark’s face, sweat shining like a spotlight on a fairy, “Wouldn’t there be other titles beside wife?”<br/><br/>She could still be a wife, a partner<br/><br/>Upon hearing her words, Kevin Clark laughed softly and after a while, he said: “Do I get a reward for winning?”<br/><br/>“Did you win?”<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>Right after his reply, Kevin Clark heard Daisy Zane hiss and draw a cold breath. He thought he had hurt her, so he instinctively let go.<br/><br/>And the next second, Daisy Zane made her move again.<br/><br/>One arm was pressed against his neck, and the other hand took off her hairpin and pointed it at his neck.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark watched her hair fall apart as the beautiful face beneath was partly veiled by it.<br/><br/>The once elegant and aloof coldness turned into distant coldness.<br/><br/>He heard the little girl’s faintly triumphant tone in her cold voice: “Did you win?”<br/><br/>“I lost.” Kevin Clark tucked her loose hair behind her ear, stroking her face with a touch of indulgence, “Cheating.”<br/><br/>“Thirty-six tricks ” Daisy Zane took her hand back, put the hairpin in her pocket, and said softly, “Seduction.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s smile deepened, his hand that had been touching her face, cupped the back of her head and gently pulled her forward: “Madam used a beauty trick, I should have some sort of response, right?”<br/><br/>After saying that, Kevin Clark lowered his head and kissed her lips.<br/><br/>When the two of them went out again, Michael Jackson keenly sensed an ambiguous atmosphere surrounding them.<br/><br/>And What did they do to be so sweaty?<br/><br/>The shooting range’s soundproofing was good, and only distant gunshots could be heard. Michael Jackson only heard gunshots outside and then there was silence. Afterward, the two of them came out drenched in sweat.<br/><br/>“Two wood posts on the combat platform have been snapped. Let someone replace them.” Kevin Clark said.<br/><br/>Michael Jackson’s face contorted instantly.<br/><br/>What???<br/><br/>How intense was their fight?<br/><br/>What had happened?<br/><br/>Did he miss a domestic violence scene?\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
