It had only been used with that black card and no other cards.<br/><br/>And the phone had only been used for taking Daisy Zane’s photo, sending it to Kevin Clark, and calling him.<br/><br/>The person was very cautious, leaving nothing behind.<br/><br/>This stranger was not found, and the photos of Daisy Zane and William Lane did not spread.<br/><br/>However... these few photos were like needles buried in Kevin Clark’s heart.<br/><br/>It seemed that the other party wanted to plant these needles.<br/><br/>This person succeeded, yet also failed.<br/><br/>Because it was clear that the person was targeting Daisy Zane, trying to affect the relationship between Kevin Clark and Daisy Zane.<br/><br/>But the needles that were buried didn’t poke Daisy Zane, but rather William Lane.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark naturally believed Daisy Zane and William Lane.<br/><br/>It’s just... as William Lane was always in front of him, every time he saw him, Kevin Clark would think of the photo of Daisy Zane smiling at him.<br/><br/>So Kevin Clark grew more and more disgusted with William Lane, and he acted strangely every day.<br/><br/>William Lane couldn’t understand what he had done wrong to deserve such treatment.<br/><br/>He had been experiencing Kevin Clark’s weird behavior since he was a child.<br/><br/>It really made him reflect on what he had done wrong before falling asleep at night, and how he had offended him.<br/><br/>Moreover, this time it had gone on for many days in a row.<br/><br/>Unable to deal with him, William Lane silently kept account.<br/><br/>For each time Kevin Clark targeted him, William Lane kept a tally.<br/><br/>This account was recorded from the day Charlotte Lane’s wedding took place, Kevin Clark absolutely wouldn’t be able to enter the door smoothly without him agreeing, and he wouldn’t be able to marry his sister.<br/><br/>In early April, the research institute finally completed the study of all the contents on the storage card left by Victoria Zane.<br/><br/>This little girl was a beauty-lover. She didn’t like looking like this, so she would definitely find a way to gain weight after shooting.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark followed her to the dining room, “You look good in any way, health is the most important thing.”<br/><br/>The two sat close together, and Kevin Clark placed the breakfast in front of her, serving her a bowl of soup: “Eat and then sleep for a while.”<br/><br/>“No, I can’t sleep.” Daisy Zane took a sip of the soup, “I want to go to the research institute. Can I?”<br/><br/>She had obtained a pass with her last report.<br/><br/>Later, Ezekiel Santiago offered her a position at the research institute, but she declined.<br/><br/>Now she wasn’t part of the research institute and didn’t have a pass.<br/><br/>If she wanted to go to the research institute, she would have to accept Ezekiel Santiago’s offer and become part of their institute.<br/><br/>But obviously, she couldn’t accept that position right now.<br/><br/>So she had to ask Kevin Clark.<br/><br/>She was registered as Kevin Clark’s student and had a background of support and achievements.<br/><br/>If Kevin Clark could approve, it should be no problem for her to enter the research institute for a short time.<br/><br/>And she wanted to participate in the research Kevin Clark and William Lane were leading.<br/><br/>They were all their own people... the problem shouldn’t be too big.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark peeled her a fried egg and placed it on a dish, raising his eyebrows playfully, “Bribe me a little, and you can.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked down and ate a steamed bun before asking, “How do I bribe you?”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark looked at her and chuckled, “If something that takes longer is hard to achieve, then... let’s go for something that can be done anytime.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane turned her head to look at him.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s eyes and eyebrows were full of laughter, “Call me something nice, like ‘husband’ or ‘elder brother’.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s expression remained unchanged, but her mind was instantly filled with the words “Brother Arthur.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked away and took another sip of the soup.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark also peeled himself a fried egg and took a bite.<br/><br/>Just as he was thinking about teasing her again before letting go, he heard Daisy Zane slowly, with a slightly cold voice, say, “Third Master, don’t you think we’re too close? I think we should keep some distance.”<br/><br/>“Ahem.” Kevin Clark coughed lightly, and his pupils trembled for a moment.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at him, and with a calm expression and tone, said, “I think this is a rare opportunity. Third Master can take a good look at me, and see if my attitude is suitable for entering the research institute.”<br/><br/>It was payback time.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s heart trembled, and he... started choking on the fried egg.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
