She looked down at the top of Kevin Clark’s head. <br/><br/>She was wearing high heels today, with somewhat complicated laces that needed to be wound around her ankles a few times. They had come undone after walking for too long. <br/><br/>So, Kevin Clark squatting on the ground took some effort. <br/><br/>At this moment, across the street. <br/><br/>A car drove past the side gate of the Doomsday Hotel. <br/><br/>It came out from the hotel entrance, went around a flower bed, and entered the side road. <br/><br/>Calvin Stewart sat in the back seat, talking to Tom Wayne and glancing outside. With that glance, she suddenly saw something extraordinary. <br/><br/>“Stop the car!” <br/><br/>The driver hurriedly parked on the side road’s parking space. <br/><br/>Tom Wayne was also frightened: “What’s wrong?” <br/><br/>Hardy Clark in the copilot seat also looked back: “Mom, what’s wrong?” <br/><br/>“Mom, look at that, isn’t it Third Brother?” Calvin Stewart pointed outside and said, “Just across the street, under that street lamp. Isn’t that woman Daisy <br/><br/>Zane?” <br/><br/>Tom Wayne and Hardy Clark looked over together. <br/><br/>Then the two saw, about fifty meters away, under a street lamp, Kevin Clark squatting in front of Daisy Zane, slowly tying her shoelaces. <br/><br/>Hardy Clark saw this scene and the corners of her mouth twitched a couple of times. <br/><br/>Was that her Third Uncle? Would her Third Uncle, with those precious hands and noble status, squat in front of someone and tie their shoelaces? <br/><br/>“Hardy, look, is that your Third Uncle and Daisy Zane?” Tom Wayne asked uncertainly. <br/><br/>Hardy Clark scratched her face: “Yes, yes, I guess.” <br/><br/>They all teamed up to deceive her. <br/><br/>Natalie Wayne chuckled lightly, then turned to look at Hardy Clark. <br/><br/>As Hardy Clark met her gaze, his little heart almost split apart: “Grandma, why are you looking at me like that?” <br/><br/>“What do you think?” <br/><br/>“I... I don’t know.” <br/><br/>Natalie Wayne snorted and ignored her, saying to the driver: “Let’s go home.” Then paused and added: “I’ll settle accounts with all of you later.” <br/><br/>Hardy Clark pouted, his expression pitiful. After sitting down in the copilot seat, he immediately took out his cellphone and sent a message to Hardy’s Third Uncle. <br/><br/>[Third Uncle! Emergency alert! Grandma saw you and Auntie! She’s going to settle accounts with us!] <br/><br/>As for Calvin, after he slowly processed everything, he smiled and said: “Mom, look, she and our family are destined. If she can’t be the granddaughter-in-law, she’ll be the daughter-in-law.” <br/><br/>Although Natalie Wayne was angry that these rascals conspired to deceive her, she still liked Daisy Zane. She smiled and said, “Then won’t you two go from potentially being mother and daughter-in-law to sisters-in-law?” <br/><br/>Calvin was taken aback for a moment, then laughed. <br/><br/>Thirty years ago, she gained a brother-in-law who was younger than her own son; thirty years later, she gained a sister-in-law who almost became her daughter-in-law. <br/><br/>This fate... was truly indescribable. <br/><br/>When they returned to the conference hall, most of the people had left. <br/><br/>Only a small number remained, chatting and greeting each other. <br/><br/>Kevin Clark was stopped by Hugo Clark at the entrance and was told about some matters. Daisy Zane then went inside to look for Hill Dawson and Anisa Cooper. <br/><br/>But she encountered Billy Allen again. <br/><br/>When Billy Allen saw her alone, he followed her again. <br/><br/>“Lady Catherine.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane glanced at him but didn’t stop, and continued walking inside. <br/><br/>Billy Allen followed her and said, “I apologize for my offensive words earlier. Please forgive me, Lady Catherine.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane ignored him. <br/><br/>Billy Allen examined her for a moment and said, “I was too abrupt earlier. I shouldn’t have said those words in front of so many people. Now it’s just the two of us, and I want to ask Lady Catherine again, will you be my girlfriend?” Daisy Zane stopped and looked at him. <br/><br/>Billy Allen straightened his back, his smile full of confidence: “You’ve seen my conditions, and I believe you won’t lose out if you’re with me. Also... I’m going to meet Shopie Designer later. If the collaboration works out, I could have Shopie design clothes exclusively for Lady Catherine.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane felt that she had been holding back too much. If they were abroad, this man would have already been choked if he dared to speak like this in front of her. <br/><br/>“If Lady Catherine feels it’s too troublesome,” Billy Allen continued, “we don’t have to formalize the relationship. I won’t be in the country for long. After I leave, we’ll automatically end it. I won’t let this relationship become a burden for both of us.. What do you think?”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
