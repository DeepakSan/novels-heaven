He sat down and began peeling the nuts on the table. <br/><br/>The tea master prepared tea, and everyone casually chatted. <br/><br/>After a while, Bonnie Maxwell stepped out to take a phone call. <br/><br/>She returned in 5 minutes. <br/><br/>As she sat down, she apologized, “I’m sorry, there’s something going on in Celestial Pivot.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane was watching Charles open pistachios and raised an eyebrow when she heard Bonnie’s words. <br/><br/>The phone call from Celestial Pivot Who would dare to call Bonnie now? <br/><br/>As Daisy’s words were spoken with clear intentions, Natalie Wayne and others just smiled and did not say anything. <br/><br/>It was the tea master who spoke, “Clara Mitchell is so amazing, she got into Celestial Pivot so easily.” <br/><br/>“Not really,” Bonnie replied with a smile, “It’s just that the questions were simple this year.” <br/><br/>“How could it be simple when Nathan Ninevara set the questions?” <br/><br/>Kevin Clark noticed that Charles was placing the peeled pistachios in a small plate without eating them. Realizing that he was peeling them for the little girl, Kevin snatched the pistachios away and started peeling them himself. <br/><br/>Little Charles raised his eyebrows and glared at Kevin. <br/><br/>Kevin glared back, his cold eyes saying: My wife doesn’t need your help. <br/><br/>Charles’s arrogance faded, and he quietly began peeling an orange. <br/><br/>Bonnie’s hands tightened on her lap, her face pale. She didn’t expect Harton to not even give her the slightest bit of face. <br/><br/>It took her a few seconds to suppress her surging emotions before turning to Daisy Zane and saying, “Lady Zane, I just saw some news online when I went out to answer the phone. Would you like me to help you handle it?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked up at her. <br/><br/>Walking into the muzzle of a gun. <br/><br/>Charles had bitten half an orange and looked at Bonnie as well. <br/><br/>Harton Clark blinked, afraid that Bonnie had invited his parents here today to let them know about the online news. <br/><br/>Apart from the three young members of the Clark Family, the rest had no idea what was happening online. <br/><br/>“Bonnie, what are you trying to do?” Lily Parker’s expression turned cold. <br/><br/>Calvin Stewart, who rarely saw his daughter like this, asked, “What’s wrong?” <br/><br/>Bonnie ignored Lily Parker and said impatiently, “It’s not a big deal. Someone just posted a video online.” <br/><br/>Natalie Wayne looked at her. <br/><br/>Bonnie paused, seemingly unable to speak. She found the video and played it once on the tea table. <br/><br/>The video wasn’t long and finished playing very quickly. <br/><br/>People from the other table also came over. <br/><br/>Harton Clark wanted to stop them, but Daisy Zane held him back. <br/><br/>The duration of the video allowed her to think about which place would be suitable for Bonnie to spend the second half of her life. <br/><br/>Bonnie glanced at the awkward faces of the Clark Family members, feeling very pleased. She looked at Daisy Zane and said, “Lady Zane, whether it’s true or false, we need to cool things down first. I heard about it too late, or else it wouldn’t have escalated like this online.” <br/><br/>Charles took another bite of the orange. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at Bonnie. <br/><br/>It seemed like Bonnie really wanted to find a solution, she spoke sincerely, “I happen to have brought my computer, so I can find the man’s location. We can persuade him to change his tune, and that way, we can also salvage Lady Zane’s reputation. If we give him some more money, he’ll forget about Lady Zane.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
