In particular, the moment they saw Daisy Zane, everyone’s pupils seemed to pause for a moment. <br/><br/>The eerie silence was broken in that instant, and a trend of relaxation appeared. <br/><br/>Robinson Scott looked at Daisy Zane and almost cried with excitement, as if he had seen a savior. <br/><br/>Arthur North approached Daisy Zane before everyone else, and said while looking down at her, “How did you come out?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane glanced at the people in the living room before finally looking up at him, her beautiful phoenix-like eyes calm and waveless: “What do you think?” <br/><br/>Olivia Lane looked at her sideways and thought to herself, she’s so brave to talk to Arthur North like that. <br/><br/>Despite being lightly teased, Arthur North showed no temper and smiled gently, “Don’t worry, nothing will happen.” <br/><br/>After speaking, he looked at Olivia Lane, and the smile in his eyes disappeared more than half in an instant. <br/><br/>Feeling his gaze, Olivia Lane didn’t dare to look up at him and directly lowered her gaze to hide behind Daisy Zane. <br/><br/>Then Daisy Zane met Arthur North’s serious and imposing gaze. <br/><br/>Arthur North: GEtt the latest novels at novelhall.com<br/><br/>Hugo Clark and Allonzo Hobson immediately came over as well. Robinson Scott wanted to come too, but as soon as he took a step forward, his father’s handcuffs pulled him back. <br/><br/>The Scott Family’s previous status in Imperial Capital was on par with the <br/><br/>Clark Family and the Lane Family, known as the three great families of Imperial Capital. The three families restrained each other and maintained a balance of power. <br/><br/>However, more than thirty years ago, for some reason, Adam Scott, the only child of the Scott Family, went to the Mountain Sea Continent with Pete Baker. Since then, the Scott Family declined, leaving only the Clark Family and the Lane Family. <br/><br/>But Adam Scott developed well in the Mountain Sea Continent, and his power was still great, so he still had prestige in Imperial Capital. <br/><br/>He even brought so many people to Imperial Capital, showing a force capable of confronting both the Clark and Lane families head-on. <br/><br/>However, his attitude towards Daisy Zane seemed somewhat cautious. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at Robinson Scott again and said: “Uncle Scott, you should know, Robinson wouldn’t dare to lie to you.” <br/><br/>Robinson Scott’s head nodded like a drum. <br/><br/>Adam Scott glared at him again: “But they were on the same bed.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at Robinson Scott again. Seeing her lower her head, pouting her mouth, she knew that she must have been frightened by her father’s lustful power and slipped up. <br/><br/>Otherwise, the surveillance photos only captured the two of them at the entrance of the room, and how could Adam Scott know that they had gotten onto the same bed? <br/><br/>“Uncle Scott, this matter is indeed my fault,” said Allonzo Hobson. “I didn’t handle it well. If you need any compensation, I will do my best.” <br/><br/>Ever since they arrived, Allonzo Hobson’s attitude had been very good. <br/><br/>After all, as a girl, although nothing happened between them, it wasn’t good for her reputation either. So Allonzo Hobson set his attitude straight from the beginning. <br/><br/>However, from the moment Adam Scott entered, no matter what he said, he didn’t respond to a single word.
