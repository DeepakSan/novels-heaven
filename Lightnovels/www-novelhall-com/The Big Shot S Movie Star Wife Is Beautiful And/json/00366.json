I came to pick you up.” Kevin Clark’s thumb stroked her face, “Did they upset you?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane didn’t say anything, which was taken as a yes.<br/><br/>Normally, Daisy Zane wouldn’t have such a large emotional fluctuation. But today, she was affected by that figure, and because of the sudden obstruction, she heard some unpleasant words.<br/><br/>So, she didn’t control her emotions very well.<br/><br/>She just suppressed the violence in her heart.<br/><br/>Kevin rarely saw her like this, and precisely because it was rare, he felt that today’s incident was serious.Th.ê most uptodate novels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m<br/><br/>He held Daisy Zane’s hand and found that her skin was broken.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark frowned, gently stroked the area around the broken skin, and then looked up at the two people opposite: “I’m curious how did you manage to irritate my little girl?”<br/><br/>The way he said it was light and floating, but it gave the feeling that Kevin Clark might just kill someone in the next second.<br/><br/>The man beside him almost bulged his eyes out when he heard him speak like this.<br/><br/>Is this is this Third Master’s woman being bullied on his own territory?<br/><br/>Fog Mountain would it be leveled?<br/><br/>“So, it’s your wild lover.” Mrs. Davis said while holding her arm.<br/><br/>As soon as these words came out, everyone, including Amelia Miles, was stunned by the three words “wild lover.”<br/><br/>Someone dared to scold Kevin Clark as a wild lover.<br/><br/>After Daisy Zane was stunned for a moment, the corners of her mouth suddenly moved twice. She tried hard to keep her mouth from twitching, but couldn’t do it after a while.<br/><br/>So she turned her head and looked back, lowering her head and laughing.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark didn’t even need to look to know the little girl was laughing. He pinched Daisy Zane’s hand and whispered: “Wild lover ”<br/><br/>“You probably don’t know it yet. This girlfriend you hold in the heart, while being with you, is also hooking up with my son.” Mrs. Davis raised her chin and continued, “You hold her in your heart, but she treats you as a backup. Young man, let me remind you. It’s better to get away from such a woman as early as possible. So that you don’t get infected with any dirty things or catch some filthy diseases.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark’s expression grew colder inch by inch.<br/><br/>As soon as he opened his mouth, it seemed as if he was claiming a life: “Michael Jackson.”<br/><br/>Michael Jackson, who was behind him, immediately stepped forward, grabbed Mrs. Davis’s face with one hand, and forced her to open her mouth.<br/><br/>Moreover, the force was so great that Mrs. Davis felt as if her jaw was about to be crushed.<br/><br/>Michael Jackson, gripping her chin, dragged her directly into the private room next to them.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane, with her elbow on the armrest of the chair and her chin resting on her hand, laughed softly when she heard this.<br/><br/>When she first met this woman, she thought she was quite smart in addition to her opportunistic nature.<br/><br/>But she didn’t expect to lose control of the situation after being provoked and scared.<br/><br/>Publicly ranting like a lunatic. Most likely because she had been kicked out of the Doomsday Hotel and harbored resentment.<br/><br/>Now it was just that her brain was short-circuited by the fear of Kevin Clark.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark looked at her, the maliciousness in his eyes was like a sharp sword, capable of slaying people. Scold his Little Girl, and rob his nephew of his love interest?<br/><br/>“Not to mention how the Lane Family cherishes the little princess in her family. What makes you think the Lane and Clark families will face each other?” Kai Lincoln said with a smile.<br/><br/>“What do you mean?” Mrs. Davis asked subconsciously.<br/><br/>No one answered her.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark glanced at Michael Jackson.<br/><br/>Michael Jackson raised his hand and pinched Mrs. Davis’ jaw again, then with a forceful push, Mrs. Davis’ jaw dislocated.<br/><br/>She cried out and then sat directly on the ground. The pain made her tremble all over, and she couldn’t close her open mouth at all as saliva flowed out constantly.<br/><br/>Amelia Miles suddenly widened her eyes, looking at what was happening, her body seemed to be frozen, unable to speak or move.<br/><br/>They were so ruthless.<br/><br/>“Mrs. Davis, before you speak, make things clear. It’s your son pestering my Little Girl. Not reporting your son for harassment is already a blessing for your family,” Kevin Clark said, “Also your son my Little Girl wouldn’t even want to take a second look at him. Don’t think too highly of yourself.”<br/><br/>Mrs. Davis covered her mouth and tried to speak, but could only make “Wu,wu,wu,” sounds.<br/><br/>“Remember, trouble comes from your mouth. In consideration of you being a woman, I’ll show some mercy,” Kevin Clark said, “So what’s left is for the Davis family to pay.”<br/><br/>“Ah, ah, ah—” Mrs. Davis screamed.<br/><br/>Kevin Clark didn’t bother her any more, but turned to Amelia Miles: “Miss what are you doing?”<br/><br/>When Amelia Miles was suddenly called out, her whole body trembled. This man was so good-looking, and his voice was gentle. But Amelia Miles felt like she was looking at a poisonous snake, the venom seeping into her skin and spreading throughout her body.<br/><br/>Making every inch of her skin hurt: “I, I didn’t do anything, I didn’t do anything.”<br/><br/>“Miss Miles, you’re here in the Imperial Capital to participate in a dance competition, right?”<br/><br/>Amelia Miles’s eyes trembled, her breathing quickened. What, what did he want?<br/><br/>All the horrifying scenarios seemed to pass through Amelia Miles’s mind, and her body quickly turned cold. Then she suddenly looked at Daisy Zane and pleaded: “Sister ”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at her, her gaze paused on Amelia for two seconds before shifting away and said, “Let’s go, I’m tired.”<br/><br/>Kevin Clark tilted his head, he noticed Daisy Zane letting Amelia off the hook more than once. He smiled and said gently, “Alright, let’s go back.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
