She deliberately glanced at Daisy Zane. <br/><br/>But Daisy didn’t look at her, she was just looking at the equipment nearby. <br/><br/>During the script reading, Serena was always by Lilian Lopez’s side, sometimes even helping her with her lines. So although she didn’t remember the Female <br/><br/>Lead’s lines, she had a general idea about them. <br/><br/>She quickly memorized the lines for this scene. <br/><br/>Before the audition, Daisy, who had been silent all along, came over to Serena <br/><br/>and said, “In tms drama crew, you’ve been witn Lilian Lopez tor so long, you should understand this character.” <br/><br/>Serena licked her dry lips, “I’m a little nervous.” <br/><br/>“Imagine your opponent is Lilian Lopez.” Daisy said casually, half-closing her eyes. <br/><br/>Serena bit her lip and went to the director, returning the script. <br/><br/>This scene was about the Female Lead capturing the murderer who killed Riley Maxwell, torturing him like a madwoman, venting all her longing and hatred on him. <br/><br/>It was quite a test of explosive power. <br/><br/>The director’s assistant acted opposite her. <br/><br/>Serena was very nervous, but her mind was very clear. This was an opportunity, a once-in-a-lifetime chance that might never come again. She had to seize it. <br/><br/>She had originally given up her position to join the drama crew as an extra. Over the years, she had supported herself by taking on temporary jobs, without even having any insurance. <br/><br/>She pinched herself hard in the palm of her hand, closed her eyes and took a deep breath. When she opened her eyes again, it was as if she had become a <br/><br/>different person: “You deserve to die!” <br/><br/>The director, who was flipping through the script, suddenly looked up at Serena when he heard her shout. <br/><br/>Serena’s eyes were filled with hatred, and her expression was even a little twisted: “When you reported my sister back then and pushed her to a dead end, did you ever think that you would have today!” The initial posting of this chapter occurred via noovelllbbin<br/><br/>Serena’s emotions were very full, and her line delivery was quite good. <br/><br/>The director’s eyes widened. Even George Dunn was pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>When the scene was over, the director stood up and stared at Serena. <br/><br/>At first, Serena was very nervous, but seeing the director’s reaction, she suddenly wanted to laugh. <br/><br/>“Cough, Director Nash.” George Dunn reminded him from the side. <br/><br/>Daisy didn’t want to talk about this subject but thought that they still have a lot of scenes to film together, so she just hummed in response. <br/><br/>“Your voice actually sounds a lot like hers,” George said, “and your deep understanding of the characters is also quite similar. I always feel like you two would get along great.” <br/><br/>“Oh, really? What if we are the same person?” Daisy said. <br/><br/>“Hahaha, Riley, you’re really in sync with her, even your jokes are the same,” George, such a famous actor, wore expensive clothes but sat on a small stool and appeared very down-to-earth. “For her next script, I’ll introduce you to her. I’m sure you two will have a great time chatting.” <br/><br/>Daisy raised her head and looked at him, remaining silent for a while. She remembered what he had said before: “If you were standing in front of me, I’d surely recognize you at once.” <br/><br/>She was curious about what gave him such confidence. <br/><br/>“Well, then... Thank you in advance, Best Actor Dunn.” Daisy forced herself to smile politely. <br/><br/>“Great. So that’s settled.” George was in a great mood, stood up and said, “I’m going to rest over there now.” <br/><br/>“Take your time, Best Actor Dunn.” <br/><br/>As George walked barely five meters away, Daisy received a message from him. <br/><br/>NIAN: [Catherine, I found a great actor for you. She’s got great acting skills, insightful, and is incredibly beautiful. You’ll absolutely love her, praise me!] <br/><br/>Daisy looked at the message, gripping her cellphone, and grinding her teeth. She not only wanted to open George’s head to see if there was something missing inside but also return to a few years ago to check her own head and figure out what she saw in this idiot! <br/><br/>After they finished filming the scenes for the morning, they still had two more in the afternoon. <br/><br/>At noon, the drama crew was about to have lunch. Daisy was about to grab her boxed meal when she got a phone call from Harton Clark. <br/><br/>“What’s up? <br/><br/>“Have you eaten?” Harton asked. <br/><br/>“I’m waiting to get my boxed meal.” <br/><br/>“I’m by the nanny car, I brought you food. Want to come over and eat?” “Okay.” Daisy turned around and walked towards the nanny car. “I’m coming.” <br/><br/>When Daisy arrived, Harton was standing by the nanny car, holding two food boxes in his hands. <br/><br/>Hearing her footsteps, Harton turned around to look at her. His smiling eyes froze for a moment before he raised his eyebrows. <br/><br/>Today, Daisy was wearing a very vintage light blue dress, her hair curled in big waves, and a white veil on her head. <br/><br/>She looked stunning. <br/><br/>Seeing his expression, Daisy said, “I still have scenes to shoot in the afternoon, so there’s no time to change.” <br/><br/>“You look beautiful,” Harton sincerely praised. Daisy smiled, opened the car door, and said, “Get in.” <br/><br/>“You first.’ <br/><br/>Daisy didn’t stand on ceremony, picked up her skirt with one hand and stepped into the car. She was wearing high heels, but her movements were swift. <br/><br/>Harton wanted to help her, but didn’t find the opportunity..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
