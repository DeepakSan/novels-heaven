After parking the car, he caught up with her before she could enter the company. <br/><br/>“Miss Zane, could you wait for me?” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane stopped and looked at him, holding back an urge to snap, she said, <br/><br/>“Could you please be quieter?” <br/><br/>“Oh, you prefer silence.” Liam Davis laughed, “Okay, I’ll shut my mouth.” <br/><br/>“Sister, you came to the company.” Amelia Miles’s voice sounded behind the two. <br/><br/>Both turned around to look. <br/><br/>Amelia Miles was smiling obediently, walking towards them in high heels. Daisy glanced at her and went straight into the company. <br/><br/>“Hey, Daisy Zane.” <br/><br/>There’s a card reader before the elevator at Maple Elite Entertainment. Only with a card can one get in. <br/><br/>In the blink of an eye, Daisy swiped her card and got in. Liam Davis didn’t even have the chance to catch up with her, and in his anxiety, he called out her name. But Daisy had already entered the elevator. <br/><br/>“Mr. Davis.” Amelia Miles came over at this moment and greeted Liam Davis. <br/><br/>“Miss Miles.” Liam Davis replied politely. <br/><br/>“You accompanied my sister to the company?” Amelia looked towards the elevator. <br/><br/>“Yes.” Liam Davis lost the playful expression he had on the way, “Miss Miles, are you here to see your fiancé?” <br/><br/>Amelia’s smile stiffened for a moment, but she recovered quickly, speaking softly, “Well, he has been quite busy these days, so I came to check on him.” Liam Davis remained silent, glancing towards the elevator again. <br/><br/>Seeing this, Amelia thoughtfully said, “Mr. Davis, would you like to come in? I can take you to my sister.” <br/><br/>“No, it’s okay.” Liam said, “She has to work. I don’t want to disturb her. I’ll just wait for her here.’ <br/><br/>Amelia nodded, then silently said, “Mr. Davis, my sister grew up in the countryside. Her education is limited and her temper sometimes gets out of control. I hope Mr. Davis would be more tolerant towards her.” <br/><br/>Liam Davis finally looked at her squarely. His face was inscrutable as he said, <br/><br/>She was clearly exhausted. <br/><br/>“Sister Emily.” <br/><br/>“Come on, Let me introduce you,” Emily Dawson said, “Her name is Anisa <br/><br/>Cooper. She’s a senior at Truro University and is currently doing an internship. She’s majoring in Cultural Industry Management.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at her. <br/><br/>Anisa Cooper didn’t have the kind of looks that would strike one as beautiful at first glance, but she held a subtle charm that made her appear more endearing the more one looked at her. <br/><br/>She dressed modestly, in a basic tracksuit, and the cuffs of the suit had seen some wear. <br/><br/>She was clean and competent. <br/><br/>Daisy Zane’s aura was somewhat intimidating, making Anisa Cooper feel rather awkward. “H- Hello, Miss Everleigh. You can call me Naomi.” “Hello,” Daisy Zane withdrew her gaze, “we’ll go with her.” <br/><br/>Anisa Cooper excitedly pinched her own hand. <br/><br/>“Good,” Emily Dawson laughed, “I also think Naomi is a good choice.” Anisa Cooper shied away with a smile. <br/><br/>Emily Dawson said, “Sit, both of you sit. I have something to say.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane sat down and looked at her. <br/><br/>“There are rumors that ‘Spotlight’ is looking for a spokesperson from its domestic market,” Emily Dawson said, “Recently, many artists have been keeping an eye on Spotlight’s official media.” <br/><br/>“Who?” The look on Daisy Zane’s usually calm face suddenly showed a slight surprise. <br/><br/>“Spotlight.” Emily finished, then added, “Oh, maybe you haven’t heard too much about it. Naomi, do you know?” <br/><br/>Anisa Cooper nodded and said, “Spotlight is a top-level luxury accessory brand. Currently, it is the only domestic brand among the top ten luxury accessory brands in the world. The founder is Felix Baker, and the chief designer is Clayson Ninevara.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane: . <br/><br/>“The implication of ‘Spotlight’ is to make each accessory play a key role.” <br/><br/>Emily Dawson was very pleased with Anisa Cooper and gave a nod of approval. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Daisy Zane maintained an emotionless expression, just curling her lips slightly. <br/><br/>“Felix Baker’s designs already enjoyed great reputation abroad at the time. The emergence of designer Clayson Ninevara three years ago directly enabled Spotlight to establish its position in the international arena as one of the top ten brands.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane saw a starlight in Anisa Cooper’s eyes. <br/><br/>“Moreover, Spotlight’s design style is very variable. Most of them have traditional characteristics, focusing on traditional culture. Integrating trends into tradition and using tradition to guide trends, occasionally there could be some quite Westernized designs.” <br/><br/>Daisy Zane listened silently as Anisa Cooper sung praises of Spotlight, her face gradually becoming numb..Read latest chapters at novelhall.com Only\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
