However, she still became one of the brightest stars in her field and reached the peak.<br/><br/>She broke the industry’s discrimination against women and against women who get married and have children.<br/><br/>Therefore, Daisy Zane admires Edbert Shire and pays attention to her as well.<br/><br/>“It’s fine.” Turner Daniel said, “My mom won’t mind. She said that a fool like me is not qualified to understand her research.”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane lightly lifted her mouth into a smile, then picked up her pen and wrote a few steps on the test paper: “Your professor must have used this method.”<br/><br/>Turner Daniel watched her write the steps and listened to her speak. He paused before saying, “Ah, right, it’s this one. Sister Lucia, how come you know everything?”<br/><br/>Daisy Zane put down the pen and said faintly: “A little bit of knowledge.”<br/><br/>The words “a little bit” made Turner Daniel twitch his mouth. If this was just a little bit, he must be worthless then.<br/><br/>Celeste Martin and Jessica Maxwell stood and sat on the side, left out, and ignored.<br/><br/>Jessica Maxwell’s face was livid with embarrassment and anger, suffocated as she watched the two converse.<br/><br/>While Celeste Martin watched the two impassively, she was sure the Director Group had arranged a script for Daisy Zane.<br/><br/>Just then, the chair where Jessica Maxwell was sitting was kicked lightly, causing her to feel the vibration.Yôur favorite stories at novelhall.com<br/><br/>She looked up and saw Olivia Lane standing beside her, carrying a delicate food box in her hand, looking at her coldly, and said, “Don’t you have your own<br/><br/>seat?”<br/><br/>Hearing her voice, Daisy Zane immediately looked at her.<br/><br/>Jessica Maxwell looked at her and said, “Is it wrong to sit for a while?”<br/><br/>“No.” Olivia Lane glanced down at her.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at her little movement, and smiled, “No more, I’m allergic to olives, eating too much will cause me a rash.”<br/><br/>Olivia Lane suddenly turned her head to look at her. Daisy Zane didn’t expect her reaction to be so big: “What’s the matter?”<br/><br/>“Allergic? Rash?” Olivia Lane stared at her blankly.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane nodded.<br/><br/>“Then why are you still eating.”<br/><br/>“It’s fine if I eat just a little.”<br/><br/>Olivia Lane slowly clenched her hands, staring at her, and once again seemed a little lost.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane felt something was off with her, just about to speak, Olivia Lane’s cell phone suddenly vibrated.<br/><br/>Olivia Lane came to her senses, glanced at her cell phone, and saw a call from William Lane. It must be because the dormitory supervisor reported her this morning.<br/><br/>Olivia Lane’s face showed a moment of speechlessness, then she picked up her phone and went out.<br/><br/>Daisy Zane looked at her back, feeling that the little miss’ reaction was not quite right, but since she was making a phone call, it was not appropriate to follow her, so she didn’t move.<br/><br/>After Olivia Lane answered the phone, she went up to the rooftop of the building.<br/><br/>“Brother, what happened?” Olivia Lane answered the phone cheerfully.<br/><br/>“You tell me what happened?” William Lane spoke softly, “What were you doing this morning? Why didn’t you go to class?” “I didn’t sleep well last night. So, I just slept a little longer.”<br/><br/>“Why didn’t you sleep well last night?”<br/><br/>“Last night... Last night...” Olivia Lane said, “Arthur North’s girlfriend insisted on playing with me.”<br/><br/>Olivia Lane’s appearance on the variety show had been approved by William Lane, otherwise, her dormitory switch would not have gone smoothly.<br/><br/>“Olivia, be polite.”<br/><br/>“Oh, alright.” Olivia Lane said, “Third Uncle’s girlfriend insisted on playing with me.”<br/><br/>“Really?”<br/><br/>“Yeah.” Olivia Lane went to the roof, raised her hand to block the sunlight, “If you don’t believe me, you can come back and ask her personally.”<br/><br/>William Lane laughed, “Don’t bully people. She is Arthur’s girlfriend and will be your Third Aunt in the future. Take care of her.”<br/><br/>“She’s already twenty-six, and she doesn’t need me to take care of her.” Olivia Lane mumbled.<br/><br/>“Be good.” William Lane spoke softly, “You study well and be obedient. Don’t sneak out of school by yourself; it’s not safe without someone following you.”<br/><br/>“I know, brother.” Olivia Lane dragged her voice..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
