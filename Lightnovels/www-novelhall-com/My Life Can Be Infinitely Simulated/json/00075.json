Haste to contact them may reveal these are stolen goods, and who will protect you from getting blackmailed?<br/><br/>Gu Yang hadn’t considered that beforehand.<br/><br/>This was a real problem now.<br/><br/>Something he couldn’t quickly liquidate had no value to him at the moment.<br/><br/>No, there was some value.<br/><br/>He looked at the pitch-black blade on the table, which seemed unremarkable.<br/><br/>But if it could be among these treasures, it could not be a common weapon.<br/><br/>Gu Yang reached out to pick up the blade. It was heavy as he lifted it.<br/><br/>The density was several times that of gold, but he didn’t know what material it was made of.<br/><br/>He infused a trace of his True Essence into the blade, but there was no reaction.<br/><br/>He was somewhat disappointed. It was said that the famous divine weapons in the world all had spiritual properties, could be driven by True Essence, and possessed infinite power.<br/><br/>With a divine weapon in hand, one’s strength could increase considerably.<br/><br/>Since there was no response after infusing True Essence, the blade wasn’t made of True Essence.<br/><br/>Seeing him pick up the blade, Cao Yiyi on the side chimed in, “This blade is called Phoenix Feather; It was once an heirloom of the Gu Family, although it is not a divine weapon, it is extremely sturdy and even divine weapons cannot harm it. The ancestor of the Gu Family once fought with the owner of the Qinglin Sword, with no clear victor. Later, the Shadow thief stole it.”<br/><br/>The Qinglin Sword was one of the top ten famous swords in the world, an unparalleled divine weapon.<br/><br/>Gu Yang stroked the blade; although not divine, it was sturdy enough, and he happened to need a suitable weapon, “I’ll take this blade.”<br/><br/>“My turn.”<br/><br/>Cao Yiyi had no objections and casually chose a box.<br/><br/>They took turns selecting, each one picking an item, until they divided all the items on the table.<br/><br/>Finally, each had four items and there was one left on the table.<br/><br/>Gu Yang looked at the last scroll, which appeared to be a painting, “How do we split the last item?”<br/><br/>“Easy.”<br/><br/>Cao Yiyi drew a short sword and was about to cut the scroll in half.<br/><br/>Gu Yang wouldn’t let her destroy the painting, so with a flick of his finger, a Wisp of Straight Yuan flew out, knocking the short sword out of her hand.<br/><br/>“Ouch.”<br/><br/>Cao Yiyi felt a great force hitting her, the short sword flew out of her hand, her palm throbbing in pain. She glared at him, annoyed, “You hurt me.”<br/><br/>Seeing her whimsical demeanor and unintentionally seductive threats, Gu Yang felt a stir in his heart, becoming alert.<br/><br/>She’s trying to seduce me, right?<br/><br/>He kept a straight face, saying, “If you don’t want it, give it to me. Don’t destroy it.”<br/><br/>Massaging her numb wrist, Cao Yiyi sulked, “No, we agreed to half each, so it must be half each.<br/><br/>Cao Xu on the side was sweating profusely, thinking, “My lady, this isn’t the time to be throwing a tantrum. Our lives are in his hands.”<br/><br/>He had personally witnessed Gu Yang nearly killing Chu Xiyue and Wu Xingyun with a single blow, showing no mercy.<br/><br/>Whether it was Chu Xiyue or Wu Xingyun, the Chu Family and Lord Jinghai behind them, they wouldn’t be any worse off than the Cao family.<br/><br/>If this man dared to hurt these two people, it shows how profound his background is.<br/><br/>If he angered him and got killed, it would be truly tragic.<br/><br/>At this moment, Cao Yiyi had a sudden thought, and with a twinkle in her eye, she laughed, asking, “Are you in need of money?”<br/><br/>She had an innate ability to easily read men’s minds.<br/><br/>Along the way, she was able to play with any man who approached her like a puppet, precisely because of this ability.<br/><br/>Therefore, she didn’t hold any man in high esteem. They all had simple minds, easily deceived by beauty, foolish in her eyes.<br/><br/>Whether it was the men approaching her, Ah Fu following her, or even Cao Xu who was known as a prestigious third rank, they all wore their emotions on their faces.<br/><br/>That was, until she met Gu Yang, who nearly took her life with one stroke of the blade.<br/><br/>That was the first time she had been so close to death’s door.<br/><br/>She had also never met such a cold-blooded and ruthless man who could be so ruthless at first meeting, seeking her life without hesitation.<br/><br/>Because of this, Cao Yiyi held onto the grudge, vowing to locate and dismantle this man to vent her hatred.<br/><br/>Who would’ve thought that when she finally met him, his strength was far beyond her imagination. Cao Xu was so frightened he didn’t even dare to draw his sword.<br/><br/>So much for the Hidden Dragon List, he was just useless!<br/><br/>Cao Yiyi felt a sense of helplessness.<br/><br/>Before, she could have her way with men, firstly because of her powerful background and secondly because of her beauty.<br/><br/>However, the man in front of her was neither afraid of her background nor had any regard for her beauty. She was helpless.<br/><br/>Yet, Cao Yiyi noticed something—he was in desperate need of money.<br/><br/>Her mind began to churn once more.<br/><br/>Gu Yang had no intention of dealing with her. He opened the last scroll and spread it out on the table.<br/><br/>Indeed, it was a painting depicting a dragon in mid-transformation, while the sky above was covered with dark clouds and countless lightning brewing within them, akin to a tribulation.<br/><br/>The painting was very good, yet there was nothing special otherwise.<br/><br/>“I have money. If you ask me, I might consider helping you,” Cao Yiyi offered.<br/><br/>Gu Yang still ignored her, looked at the painting for a while, didn’t see anything unusual, then rolled it up again, “Consider this half piece of painting as your apology. From now on, we’re even.”<br/><br/>What?<br/><br/>Cao Yiyi was stunned. She had never seen such a blatant man; he was clearly the one who had offended her.<br/><br/>Making it seem like she had offended him.<br/><br/>She was furious, yet seeing him take the painting and turn to leave, she immediately chased after him, “These items won’t be that easy to sell. Do you know who to sell them to?”<br/><br/>Gu Yang replied indifferently, “You needn’t concern yourself with this.”<br/><br/>Seeing him about to leave the tunnel, once he left, she wouldn’t know where to find him. If she wanted to seek revenge, she had no idea when that would be possible. In her desperation, Cao Yiyi blurted out, “Sell them to me.”<br/><br/>Gu Yang finally stopped. He turned to look at her, “Remember, these are your words.”<br/><br/>Cao Yiyi looked at his expressionless face. For some reason, she had a feeling that he had been waiting for her to say just that.<br/><br/>She had been fooled..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
