I see no need to beat around the bush. The Golden Phoenix Bird is about to lay eggs, but with its strength, even right after it lays its eggs, it is not something we can defeat. Our only chance lies in cooperation.”<br/><br/>The speaker was named Feng Qi, the Vice Principal of a college in the Northern Empire, a top-level legendary Beastmaster with a distinguished reputation.<br/><br/>The other man, cold and concise, said, “No hindrance should be caused, act according to your abilities.”<br/><br/>This man was named Qiu Nianzhong, from the Southern Alliance, also a top-level legendary Beastmaster. His fame was no less than that of Feng Qi.<br/><br/>Both of them turned towards the woman. She wore a purple dress, a crystalline crown on her head, her skin so white it was nearly transparent, her pupils a deep blue. Her lips parting slightly, she said, “Alright.”<br/><br/>This woman was the renowned Ice and Snow Queen, from Xirui Kingdom situated at the extreme west, an arch nemesis of the Northern Empire.<br/><br/>Naturally, she and Feng Qi looked at each other with disdain. If it weren’t for the egg of the Golden Phoenix Bird, they would have long since started fighting.<br/><br/>On the Ruiqin Continent, the recognized ones that could grow to Totem Level were only forty-seven in number.<br/><br/>The Golden Phoenix Bird was one of them.<br/><br/>For the legendary Beastmasters, the only way to progress and become a mythical Beastmaster was to tame a pet beast that had reached the Totem Level.<br/><br/>The growth level of a pet beast determines the final level limit it could achieve.<br/><br/>Since ancient times, only the God of Beastmasters was able to break this limitation.<br/><br/>All three of them present there were top-level legendary Beastmasters, but none of them had been able to progress further.<br/><br/>The reason being, Totem Level pet beasts were rare to find. The appearance of one could even instigate a war between two nations.<br/><br/>Through their respective means, they had come to know that the Golden Phoenix Bird was about to lay eggs and hence dared to take the risk by coming here.<br/><br/>The Golden Phoenix Bird was an extraordinary creature of Totem Level. Its offspring, naturally, too held the potential of Totem Level growth.<br/><br/>If they could get an egg and turn it into a pet beast, they would have a ray of hope to become a mythical Beastmaster once it matures.<br/><br/>However, the Golden Phoenix Bird was not something to mess with.<br/><br/>In history, mythical Beastmasters had tried to exploit it, but all ended in failure.<br/><br/>All three were aware that this journey was highly dangerous and fighting here was utterly foolish.<br/><br/>Therefore, no matter how deep their animosity was, they had to suppress it for the time being.<br/><br/>All the conflicts would be settled after the Golden Phoenix Bird had laid its eggs.<br/><br/>As Qiu Nianzhong had said, at that time, it was every man for themselves.<br/><br/>Suddenly, Feng Qi said, “I heard, Mu Jun is also in Wind God Valley.”<br/><br/>Hearing the name Mu Jun, the expressions of the other two changed.<br/><br/>Mu Jun had a massive reputation, although he was just a legend, he was still not easy to handle.<br/><br/>This person was known as the “King of Illusory Arts”, with a pet beast called the Fantom Jade Butterfly, known for its powerful illusions. Many top legendary Beastmasters have fallen for his tricks.<br/><br/>Feng Qi disclosing the information about Mu Jun being in the Wind God Valley was not out of generosity.<br/><br/>He had been fooled by Mu Jun once and bore a deep grudge against him. He wanted to prevent that bastard from gaining an advantage this time.<br/><br/>When the two present knew about Mu Jun’s presence, they would naturally guard against him.<br/><br/>If Mu Jun dared to show up, it would be a pleasant surprise for him.<br/><br/>Feng Qi had an in-depth knowledge of the Ice and Snow Queen. He knew her pet beast was capable of countering the Fantom Jade Butterfly. Once the dreaded illusion was broken, a Ground Bear was nothing to be afraid of.<br/><br/>All of a sudden, a powerful force erupted at the center of the valley, causing the sky and earth to change color.<br/><br/>The three top-level legendary Beastmasters felt an intense fear, as if swallowed by a wave, giving them the feeling of being in the open sea, potentially capsizing at any given moment.<br/><br/>The power of the Golden Phoenix Bird was terrifying.<br/><br/>“It has begun!”<br/><br/>Feng Qi’s expression tightened.<br/><br/>The other two also silently prepared themselves.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Boom!<br/><br/>Finally, a thick lightning bolt struck down into the valley, the aura of terror suddenly weakened significantly.<br/><br/>“It’s hatched!”<br/><br/>Just as the three top legendary Beastmasters were about to make a move, an unexpected change occurred. A figure descended from the sky, falling directly into that valley.<br/><br/>Not good!<br/><br/>Feng Qi’s face changed, he didn’t have time to think about how that person appeared. There was only one thought in his mind, he absolutely could not let the Golden Phoenix Bird’s egg be snatched away by someone else.<br/><br/>Without any hesitation, he made his move. His long-prepared pet beast flew out, attacking the figure that had killed him.<br/><br/>It was an Overlord-level lightning weasel, known for its speed, truly as fast as lightning. Over short distances, it was even faster than a Roc bird.<br/><br/>This was also why he dared to snatch the Golden Phoenix Bird’s egg.<br/><br/>Qiu Nianzhong also had the same idea, and acted almost simultaneously.<br/><br/>His pet beast was a dark two-headed hound, of the darkness element, able to blend into the darkness, come and go without a trace, killing invisibly.<br/><br/>Only the Ice and Snow Queen did not release a pet beast.<br/><br/>When she saw the way that person appeared, her pupils slightly constricted.<br/><br/>That person had appeared out of thin air, clearly having crossed through space to get here.<br/><br/>Her teacher had once told her that in Wind God Valley, there was a Teleportation Array that could lead to another world.<br/><br/>That world was called the Human Realm.<br/><br/>However, the Human Realm was extremely dangerous, and only legendary Beastmasters could venture there.<br/><br/>The person who just appeared out of nowhere, could it be that… he came from the Human Realm?<br/><br/>In the blink of an eye, the Ice and Snow Queen saw a flash of light, and then a godly bird bathed in flames and a golden-haired monkey appeared.<br/><br/>The two extraordinary creatures were indeed at the Overlord level.<br/><br/>However, she had never seen such species before.<br/><br/>Not right, that godly bird somewhat resembled the Immortal Underworld Phoenix in Hell Valley, but essentially different.<br/><br/>The bird before her eyes was sacred and pure, like a symbol of everything beautiful. It was impossible for it to belong to the same species as the evil Immortal Underworld Phoenix.<br/><br/>While the Ice and Snow Queen was surprised, the firebird and the golden-haired monkey had already blocked the lightning weasel and the dark two-headed hound.<br/><br/>Then, in an instant, they pinned them down.<br/><br/>“How can this be?”<br/><br/>She could hardly conceal the shock in her heart.<br/><br/>No matter whether it’s the lightning weasel or the dark two-headed hound, both were top Overlords. Their levels were clearly higher than that of the fire bird and the golden-haired monkey. But when they fought, they were not opponents, instead, they were at a disadvantage.<br/><br/>This meant that these two extraordinary creatures had a very high level of growth. They were most likely both at the Totem Level.<br/><br/>This man, he actually has two extraordinary creatures at the Totem level of growth!<br/><br/>Ao——<br/><br/>Just then, inside the valley, the Golden Phoenix Bird that had just laid its egg saw someone daring to approach and immediately became angry, letting out an anguished call.<br/><br/>A terrifying Wind Blade was then seen slashing towards the figure.<br/><br/>The Golden Phoenix Bird was one of the top wind element creatures in this world, and the power of this Wind Blade was terrifyingly extreme.<br/><br/>The Ice and Snow Queen’s face changed drastically.<br/><br/>The Golden Phoenix Bird had just laid its egg, yet it still had such a strong power.<br/><br/>The Wind Blade arrived in the blink of an eye, and slashed at that person.<br/><br/>He’s done for——<br/><br/>The Ice and Snow Queen could already foresee that person’s end, he would be cut in half by the Wind Blade.<br/><br/>If those two extraordinary creatures hadn’t been entangled by the lightning weasel and the dark two-headed hound, he might have been able to block this Wind Blade.<br/><br/>But it was already too late now.<br/><br/>Once this person died, those two extraordinary creatures would become unclaimed…<br/><br/>The Ice and Snow Queen was also somewhat tempted. Dealing with Overlord level creatures would be easier than provoking a Totem-level Golden Phoenix Bird.<br/><br/>Just then——<br/><br/>Boom!<br/><br/>With a earth-shaking explosion, the man in the sky, holding a knife, actually blocked that Wind Blade with his own strength.<br/><br/>How is that possible?<br/><br/>The Ice and Snow Queen was shaken.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
