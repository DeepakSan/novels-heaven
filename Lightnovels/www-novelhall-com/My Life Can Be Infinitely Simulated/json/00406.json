The Great Shaman took an antique book from his bosom, grey and unremarkable.<br/><br/>The Great Shaman bit his tongue, spitting out a mouthful of heart’s blood, which instantly merged into the book, flipping its pages until it landed on a specific page.<br/><br/>He took out a black pen and swung it, writing the two characters for “Gu Yang” on that book.<br/><br/>“Die!”<br/><br/>The Great Shaman slashed a red line across the name with the pen.<br/><br/>As he shouted this word, he seemed deflated, appearing much older.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Book of Life and Death?”<br/><br/>In the Red Mansion, the young girl exclaimed with fright; her little face turned pale white.<br/><br/>Legend spoke of an innate spirit treasure, the most fearful object in the human realm. With a mere flick of a writing brush, it could hook away a person’s soul.<br/><br/>The Human Emperor of the ancient times had been hooked away by this innate spirit treasure. Even the sword of the Human Emperor couldn’t save him.<br/><br/>The one wielding the Book of Life and Death had proclaimed himself as the Netherworld Monarch and built up the Netherworld Palace. He set up the Netherworld where the soul of the dead from the Human Realm would be hooked into the Netherworld Palace.<br/><br/>If it really was this innate spirit treasure, Gu Yang would inevitably encounter danger.<br/><br/>The young man seated on the ground with his eyes closed said, “It’s just a replica, merely a spiritual treasure.”<br/><br/>“A replica?”<br/><br/>The young girl was momentarily stunned.<br/><br/>Then she saw the sky above the city darken and a huge soul-hooking messenger appear with a black chain in his hand.<br/><br/>So terrifying!<br/><br/>She covered her eyes and dared not look anymore, trembling with fear.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>In the courtyard, the headmaster finally chose to save the hundreds of people in the yard. He thrust out his sword and transformed it into hundreds of sword intents, shattering all the black qi.<br/><br/>This sword demonstrated his peerless Swordsmanship Cultivation Level.<br/><br/>Almost simultaneously, Gu Yang outside the city was facing two opponents alone. He had managed to break the Great Shaman’s dark ghost realm and slain another Barbarian Celestial Being.<br/><br/>His eyes narrowed, he exclaimed, “Second stage?”<br/><br/>With his calm temper, he couldn’t help but lose his composure, indicating just how much astonishment he felt in his heart.<br/><br/>The Celestial Being realm had three stages. The first stage accumulated Immortal Elements and laid the foundation.<br/><br/>Most Celestial Beings, in all their lives, could only remain at this stage, unable to make further progress.<br/><br/>After the collapse of the Heavenly Way, Immortal Element lost its foundation. They needed to absorb the vitality of heaven and earth and refine it themselves, managing just a sliver a day.<br/><br/>Unlike the ancient times when the Immortal Element in the heavens and earth was thin but existed, Human Immortals could directly absorb Immortal Element from heaven and earth.<br/><br/>However slow, accumulating it in a few hundred years was possible.<br/><br/>Now, it’s ten times as difficult as it was in the ancient times.<br/><br/>Without any special opportunities, accumulating them became extremely difficult.<br/><br/>The second stage is when one could comprehend the second kind of profundities; based on this, they could cultivate real Immortal Method of Divine Power.<br/><br/>Zhanxuan Swordsmanship was actually one kind of Immortal Method.<br/><br/>Gu Yang, like him, should have also comprehended something about destruction and death.<br/><br/>Gu Yang’s breakthrough to the Celestial Being realm happened only a few days ago, right?<br/><br/>When the sky showed that blood streak and the sky was filled with a blood stain, he knew it must be Gu Yang.<br/><br/>Who knew that this kid would progress again within a few days to the second stage of the Celestial Being realm.<br/><br/>In the past, Gu Yang’s cultivation speed at the Mortal Realm and Divine Power level was astonishingly fast, and although he was surprised, he accepted it.<br/><br/>But after the Celestial Being realm, if cultivation was faster than before, who could bear that?<br/><br/>With his temper, he couldn’t help feeling immensely stimulated.<br/><br/>“Book of Life and Death?”<br/><br/>Immediately after that, he saw the Great Shaman of the Barbarian tribe take out a book and summon a huge black shadow. It was cloaked in black and held a black chain, which left him taken aback.<br/><br/>This image was exactly the soul-hooking messenger depicted in some ancient books, specialized in hooking souls.<br/><br/>In ancient times, even the peerless powerhouses like the Human Emperor could not escape the outcome of death in the human realm.<br/><br/>It was not until later that the Gold Emperor established the Divine Court and the thirty-three heavens were established by the various Sects.<br/><br/>The thirty-three heavens are known as the realm of immortality, as the soul-hooking messenger can’t reach there, and one can enjoy eternal life.<br/><br/>After the existence of the Gold Emperor, the human realm began its decline, hence deriving its name, to distinguish it from the celestial realm.<br/><br/>After the collapse of the Way of Heaven, immortality vanished from the world. From that moment on, the soul-hooking messenger no longer appeared in the human realm.<br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/>The Dean was shocked in his heart, and immediately swung his sword.<br/><br/>The second move of Zhanxuan Swordsmanship, Godslayer!<br/><br/>His mastery in swordsmanship far exceeded Gu Yang. With this sword, he instantly traversed tens of miles and struck the shadow.<br/><br/>Yet, this terrifying sword intent capable of obliterating a Celestial Being’s original spirit was pierced through it without causing any harm.<br/><br/>What?<br/><br/>HIs expression tightened, instantly realising that this soul-hooking messenger is a being of another level. It isn’t something he can handle with his existing skills.<br/><br/>The barbaric Great Shaman even has this technique!<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Hmph!”<br/><br/>The Great Shaman, seeing the soul-hooking messenger untouched under the sword intent, grew joyful and confident. He ordered, “Kill him.”<br/><br/>After obtaining the book of life and death, he had only used it to kill Unleaking Realm cultivators and never to confront Celestial Beings.<br/><br/>Because using this required a tremendous price.<br/><br/>If it wasn’t a matter of life and death, he would not want to use it.<br/><br/>Although it wasn’t a life or death situation now, if he killed that brat, he could get the immortal peach from him that extended life by a thousand years. It was worth the price.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Both “Han Wang” and the Zi Wei Taoist changed their expression when they saw the soul-hooking messenger appear.<br/><br/>One of them has lived since the ancient times.<br/><br/>The other had an uninterrupted lineage and knew about the soul-hooking messenger.<br/><br/>This was a terrifying existence that could snatch away even a celestial immortal’s soul.<br/><br/>In ancient times, after the rise of the human race, the life limit of cultivators was ten thousand years. Even for celestial immortals, when their ten thousand year limit was up, the soul-hooking messenger would appear, snatch their soul and return it to the Netherworld Palace.<br/><br/>How could such a terrifying thing be held by that old ghost from the barbaric race?<br/><br/>Especially when seeing that the dean’s sword couldn’t do anything against the soul-hooking messenger, the duo felt extremely apprehensive.<br/><br/>At this point, a black silhouette in the sky swung its chains, heading towards Gu Yang.<br/><br/>However, Gu Yang did not react at all, seeming to be dumbstruck.<br/><br/>“Han Wang” and the Zi Wei Taoist were ready to act, only awaiting when Gu Yang’s soul was hooked away. Then, they could snatch away his peach first.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“He’s done for. He’s going to die.”<br/><br/>In the Red Mansion, a little girl separated her fingers a little to sneak a peek and saw this scene, both scared and heartbroken.<br/><br/>Ever since she became sensible, she had never left this Red Mansion, essentially having no contact with the outside world.<br/><br/>But Gu Yang visited three times and was the only outsider she was in contact with. Now seeing him about to die, she naturally felt upset. Tears welled up in her eyes.<br/><br/>The man in white, sitting on the meditation pad, remained indifferent, as though the battle outside that could change the situation of the entire continent was not worth an extra glance.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“What exactly is this existence?”<br/><br/>Gu Yang looked at the huge black shadow, felt a trembling soul, and was somewhat surprised.<br/><br/>Even the Godslayer move of Zhanxuan Swordsmanship could not harm it in any way.<br/><br/>Which means, it is not a spirit type being.<br/><br/>So, what exactly is it?<br/><br/>More importantly, how is he going to survive in front of such a terror?<br/><br/>In the simulation, he didn’t die in this battle.<br/><br/>He thought about every single method, but could not find a way to break this deadlock.<br/><br/>Now, his soul was locked on, regardless of where he fled, those chains would follow.<br/><br/>Before those chains fell, Gu Yang activated all the immortal elements in his body and swung his sword, not at the shadow, but at the Great Shaman.<br/><br/>To kill him first.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
