This technique, originating from the Red Mansion, could see through a person’s actual level of Cultivation.<br/><br/>With this eye technique, the Imperial Guards could clearly track every Martial Arts master entering and leaving the Divine City.<br/><br/>Now, he was looking for a Second Grade top-level man and a Fifth Grade woman.<br/><br/>Xing Kun had been standing there since morning, as still as a rock, without altering his standing posture.<br/><br/>The city guards’ commanders standing behind him were a bit overwhelmed, but they dared not move and gritted their teeth to endure it.<br/><br/>To local authorities, the Imperial Guards were like imperial commissioners.<br/><br/>Not to mention the one in front of them, a First Rank powerhouse, and also one of the top ten officers of the Imperial Guards, was a very influential person.<br/><br/>Besides ensuring the security of Divine City, the Imperial Guards also had the responsibility to scrutinize imperial officers who broke the law.<br/><br/>Especially in recent years, a person from the inner palace bypassed the cabinet and used the Imperial Guards to suppress rivals, causing two major imprisonments that involved many officials.<br/><br/>The present Imperial Guards’ power was overwhelming; even the cabinet ministers were somewhat fearful.<br/><br/>Zhongzhou City was a provincial capital, and the head of the city guard was not of low rank, but even he was afraid to breathe heavily in front of a top officer of the Imperial Guards.<br/><br/>This round, the palace sent three top officers of the Imperial Guards to Zhongzhou, which shows its importance to the Four Sea Bank.<br/><br/>Xing Kun had no reaction when he saw Lin Liang entering the city.<br/><br/>Similarly, he showed no reaction when he saw Chen Shilin and Elder Wu.<br/><br/>Only when he saw the carriage bearing the Cao family’s crest did his expression slightly change, and show a hint of caution in his eyes.<br/><br/>He sensed that there was a terrifying powerhouse sitting inside the carriage.<br/><br/>If the Cao Family sent such a master to Zhongzhou City at this sensitive time, what would they be up to?<br/><br/>Among the nine families in the world, three were particularly noteworthy. Members of these three families had a tendency to behave capriciously, often taking unexpected actions.<br/><br/>The Cao family was one of them. The representative of such behaviour was Cao Yiyi, who had committed numerous absurd actions.<br/><br/>Xing Kun thought of this, and his heart stirred.<br/><br/>The carriage also carried another person, whose Cultivation level was so low it could be ignored.<br/><br/>If one could share a booth with a First Rank powerhouse, the person would surely not be an ordinary one.<br/><br/>“Could it be Cao Yiyi sitting in the carriage?”<br/><br/>If it was indeed her, there would be no need to worry too much.<br/><br/>Although the Miss of the Cao family behaved absurdly, she had a bottom line. She never provoked the children of the real great forces.<br/><br/>It was possible that she wanted to join in the bustle of Zhongzhou City.<br/><br/>The present Jiangzhou City was a melting pot. The fact that she had a First Rank powerhouse by her side was quite normal.<br/><br/>To be unhurried, Xing Kun summoned one of his men, and asked him to report the matter to Minister Zhuang.<br/><br/>They were led by Minister Zhuang on this trip.<br/><br/>After a while, Xing Kun saw three knights appear on the official road not far away.<br/><br/>In an instant, his gaze locked onto the man who was leading the two women on horseback.<br/><br/>Especially, the man at the forefront, his internal True Essence was like burning flames, causing a stabbing pain in his eyes.<br/><br/>“How terrifying! ”<br/><br/>A slight tremor ran through Xing Kun’s heart, he had never seen a Second Grade martial artist with such potent True Essence before.<br/><br/>Even the academy’s top student would pale in comparison.<br/><br/>The most powerful fire attribute True Essence he had witnessed was that of the fifth prince who cultivated the unparalleled divine technique, “Great Sun True Fire”.<br/><br/>However, compared to the man in front of him, it seemed like a firefly compared to the glorious moon.<br/><br/>“Which peerless technique did he cultivate?”<br/><br/>Xing Kun went over all the peerless fire attribute techniques he knew in his mind and was secretly awed.<br/><br/>Being just in his early twenties, this man was able to cultivate a peerless technique to such an extent. He was almost comparable to those at the top of the list of prodigies.<br/><br/>Which power did he belong to? “Could it be, one of those four places?”<br/><br/>Xing Kun’s eyes narrowed.<br/><br/>Those four legendary places always secluded themselves and seldom intervened in mundane matters.<br/><br/>However, once one of their disciples appeared, it would stir up a storm in the world.<br/><br/>The last time was over twenty years ago when a disciple from one of the sacred places emerged, leading to the imprisonment of the Great Zhou’s military god, the assassination of the former emperor, the decline from ten to nine surnames, and the death of several Divine Power realm cultivators…<br/><br/>It had been since then that Great Zhou began to decline.<br/><br/>Thinking of this, a deep killing intent emerged in Xing Kun’s heart.<br/><br/>His benefactor was the former military god of Great Zhou, royal Duke Wu’an.<br/><br/>He came from a humble family; his achievements today were all due to the cultivation of Duke Wu’an.<br/><br/>When he was serving under Duke Wu’an, it was the time of the Great Zhou’s great power, and its influence reached all over the place. Which force dared to invade Great Zhou?<br/><br/>With the departure of the Marquis of Wu’an, the death of the former emperor, and the doom of the Wu Family…<br/><br/>A series of calamities caused the Great Zhou to decline from its glory in just twenty short years.<br/><br/>Now, even the tiny tribes of the plains dare to continuously breach our borders.<br/><br/>The illustrious Great Zhou court has degraded to such a state.<br/><br/>Xing Kun personally witnessed the whole process of the Great Zhou’s decline from its peak, and was full of sorrow and anguish, but was also helpless. In his opinion, the instigator of all these calamities was the heir to the Holy Land.<br/><br/>However, now that the man has achieved Divine Power, he can’t cause him any harm.<br/><br/>At this moment, Xing Kun saw another person who seemed to be the offspring of the Holy Land, and the murderous intent in his heart was uncontrollable.<br/><br/>A voice in his mind surged like mad, “Take advantage of him before he grows up, kill him, to prevent him from causing chaos in the world!”<br/><br/>Before Gu Yang had even entered the city gate, he felt a wave of murderous intent directed at him, putting him under immense pressure. This murderous intent clearly came from a First Rank power.<br/><br/>“What’s going on? Shouldn’t his target be Qian Xiyun?”<br/><br/>He felt something was wrong – it seemed that First Rank was targeting him.<br/><br/>This wasn’t the First Rank from the Lin family who had been sent last time, was it?<br/><br/>Gu Yang simply could not recall when he had offended such a First Rank power, to the point that it harbored such a strong murderous intent.<br/><br/>At this moment, he didn’t have the time to think too much; he tightened his grip on the knife in his hand, focusing all his attention on the First Rank figure on the city gate tower, ready for a sudden powerful strike.<br/><br/>Facing a First Rank, he dared not be careless.<br/><br/>The person above did not make a move immediately, it seemed he was testing his patience.<br/><br/>Yet Qian Xiyun and Lily, standing nearby, seemed oblivious. When they reached the city gate, they dismounted and led their horses in.<br/><br/>Gu Yang had no choice but to do the same, walkin in while leading the horse.<br/><br/>The carriage of the Cao family suddenly stopped.<br/><br/>Inside the carriage were Cao Yiyi and Ru Qin.<br/><br/>Looking at the city gate tower, Ru Qin commented with some emotion, “The imperial family really is filled with skilled individuals. A randomly dispatched First Rank has such power.”<br/><br/>Among all the places in the world, the most First Rank powers are the ones in the royal family and the court.<br/><br/>Even a mere imperial guard holds dozens of First Ranks, exceeding any of the Nine Major Families and Six Major Sects.<br/><br/>This also accounted for the royal family’s stable rule over the world.<br/><br/>Cao Yiyi, who was beside her, lifted the curtain of the carriage to look outside and asked, “Has he arrived?”<br/><br/>Seeing her like this, Ru Qin said with a bit of pity, “On the city gate tower, there’s a First Rank from the imperial guards who has already discovered him. What’s odd is that this First Rank harbors a profound killing intent towards him, as if he can’t be left alive.”<br/><br/>After saying this, she paused for a bit, then asked, “Do you want me to save him?”<br/><br/>Cao Yiyi replied with gritted teeth, “Why save him? I wish he would die right now. I’d be appeased only if his body was torn to pieces.”<br/><br/>“Alright, then I won’t save him.”<br/><br/>Cao Yiyi kept her eyes focused in the direction of the city gate, with the hand grasping the curtain of the carriage turning slightly pale.<br/><br/>“There’s an aura of murder!”<br/><br/>On the other side, Chen Shilin also sensed the murderous intent. His inner power immediately reacted, and his hand reached for his sword, displaying an astonishing momentum.<br/><br/>Mr. Wu, however, didn’t notice any of this. His eyes were fixed on the direction of the city gate, his mind filled with shock and disbelief.<br/><br/>How could this be possible?<br/><br/>Up till now, he had met Gu Yang three times.<br/><br/>The first time was in Tianshui City, when Gu Yang was at the sixth grade of cultivation.<br/><br/>The second time, half a month later in Pingjun City, Gu Yang had upgraded to the Third Rank of cultivation and had defeated three Second Rank powers with one stroke.<br/><br/>That was already shocking enough.<br/><br/>Then he heard after a few more days that Gu Yang had reached the Second Rank of cultivation and had even defeated the genius Liu Zhe.<br/><br/>This was barely understandable.<br/><br/>But now, just a month since Pingjun City, Gu Yang had already achieved the highest Second Rank cultivation. The True Essence in his body was at its extreme.<br/><br/>He had noticed in their last encounter that Gu Yang seemed to be practicing the Shen Family’s lost “Phoenix Dance Nine Heavens”, a thought he never expressed out loud due to the severity of the matter.<br/><br/>This “Phoenix Dance Nine Heavens” was renowned for being difficult to cultivate. Throughout the generations of the Shen Family, many talented individuals were unable to advance this technique to the First Rank.<br/><br/>Shocking him now, Gu Yang had achieved the peak of Second Rank, just one step away from the First Rank.<br/><br/>What baffled him was that just a month ago Gu Yang was a mere Third Rank cultivator.<br/><br/>Advancing to Second Rank in one month was acceptable, but leaping from Third Rank to the peak of Second Rank within a month, how on earth did he achieve that?<br/><br/>Mr. Wu even suspected that there might be a problem with his eyes.<br/><br/>PS: The second chapter is in need of monthly votes, the next chapter will be out before 8 0’clock..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
