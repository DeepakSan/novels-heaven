After a fierce battle, you captured it and extracted two drops of phoenix’s essence blood from it.]<br/><br/>[Just as you absorbed the two drops of essence blood, a Celestial Being launched an attack on you. Being outmatched, you transformed into a phoenix and escaped.]<br/><br/>[Halfway across the continent, another Celestial Being possessing a pet beast appeared. With no escape route, you were captured.]<br/><br/>[The person tried to make you his pet beast but failed. A year later, all four of your divine beast incarnations were captured as pets. You formed a special contract relationship with him.]<br/><br/>[After another seven years, your Beast-taming Space upgraded, making you a mid-level Beastmaster.]<br/><br/>[One day, a strong man from the Immortal Palace descended on Ruiqin Continent. Two Celestial Beings died, and dozens of cities fell. The major powers on the continent had no choice but to join forces to resist a powerful enemy.]<br/><br/>[You followed that Celestial Being into battle. The battle turned the world upside down. Several Celestial Beings died in battle, and only you and that Celestial Being managed to escape thanks to your astonishing speed.]<br/><br/>[After this battle, the remaining forces on Ruiqin Continent retreated to the Beast God Temple.]<br/><br/>[A year later, you made a breakthrough in the Beast God Temple, and your Beast-taming Space upgraded again, making you a high-level Beastmaster.]<br/><br/>[Shortly after, the strong men from the Immortal Palace launched the final battle. Your Beast God Temple was breached, you were hit by a stray bullet, and died on the spot at the age of 31.]<br/><br/>“Wanted to make me his pet beast?”<br/><br/>Gu Yang found it somewhat terrifying that a Celestial Being would demean him like that.<br/><br/>Luckily it didn’t work. Otherwise, being someone else’s pet beast would have been a dark chapter in his life.<br/><br/>Better not let me find out who you are!<br/><br/>He clenched his teeth a bit.<br/><br/>However, it could also be seen from here that although he practiced the sorcery of the Monster Race and cultivated a real phoenix form, woke up part of the monster bloodline, he did not become a monster himself.<br/><br/>This could be considered good news, right?<br/><br/>Of course, it might also be because he became a Beastmaster.<br/><br/>If he hadn’t become a Beastmaster, the outcome could have been very different.<br/><br/>Gu Yang also noticed something unusual.<br/><br/>He stayed in that Beast God Temple for a year, and his Beast-taming Space was upgraded to become a high-level Beastmaster.<br/><br/>This level was equivalent to a martial artist’s golden body triple level.<br/><br/>Of course, a Beastmaster without a pet beast was useless and had no fighting power.<br/><br/>The spells he currently knew provided limited power increase to his four incarnations, mainly due to their low levels.<br/><br/>During this journey, the greatest gain was extracting two drops of essence blood from the Immortal Underworld Phoenix.<br/><br/>Just these two drops of essence blood alone were worth the trip.<br/><br/>[The simulation is over. You can keep one of the following items.]<br/><br/>[One, your Martial Arts realm at the age of 31.]<br/><br/>[Two, your Martial Arts experience at the age of 31.]<br/><br/>[Three, the life wisdom you gained by the age of 31.]<br/><br/>“I choose one.”<br/><br/>Suddenly, Gu Yang felt a change in the Beast-taming Space in his mind. It had grown stronger and more solid.<br/><br/>If he could capture a Monster Beast below the golden body triple level, sign a contract with it, he could store it in this Beast-taming Space.<br/><br/>But in Great Zhou, Monster Beasts had long vanished. Not to mention beasts of the golden body realm, even those of the mortal realm were rarely seen.<br/><br/>“If I want to catch a monster, I would either have to find the legendary Penglai Heaven or go to Ruiqin Continent. Oh, and there are also some Monster Beasts in Shuiyue Dongtian.”<br/><br/>No one knows where the entrance to Penglai Heaven is.<br/><br/>Shuiyue Dongtian is too dangerous, several Nascent Soul stage powerhouses are waiting for him to show up, even if he could kill them, a Celestial Being would descend.<br/><br/>It’s too dangerous.<br/><br/>As for Ruiqin Continent, it was even more dangerous. If he was careless, he would be chased by Celestial Beings who wanted to make him their pet beasts.<br/><br/>Who knows if among those Celestial Beings there were some oddballs who would do some weird experiments on him if they found out they could not turn him into a pet beast.<br/><br/>Just forget it.<br/><br/>Right, speaking of it, I have a Monster Beast right by my side.<br/><br/>Gu Yang suddenly thought of Cui’er!<br/><br/>Isn’t that little green bird a Monster Beast?<br/><br/>His thoughts suddenly became active, so why not try to make this extraordinary little green bird his pet beast?<br/><br/>The level of Cui’er was always a mystery. When outside Divine City, it swallowed Red Sun’s full strength attack in one gulp.<br/><br/>But that was its only shining moment. After that, except for its fast flying speed, it didn’t have any other attack methods.<br/><br/>Gu Yang once again brought up the system and initiated a simulation.<br/><br/>[… You went to Tianzhu Mountain and found Xi Huang and the bluebird. When you made a contract with the bluebird and tried to store it in the Beast Taming Space, the space collapsed instantly. You were hurt from the backlash.]<br/><br/>[Dragging your injuries, after several days, you returned to the ancient teleportation array, but Shen Yun discovered your trail and followed you to Ruiqin Continent.]<br/><br/>[Using the ruins, you successfully trapped Shen Yun. The noises from the battle attracted a Golden Peng Bird, a Celestial Being level beast, which took a fancy to you and brought you back to its nest to live together.]<br/><br/>[You were trapped in the Golden Peng Bird’s nest, unable to leave. It had just finished laying eggs and was incubating them. It would not let you out of its sight.]<br/><br/>[Half a year later, Saint Chao Yang suddenly appeared and fought the Golden Peng Bird. You seized this opportunity to escape, but you hadn’t gone far when you were caught up by the Golden Peng Bird.]<br/><br/>[After another two months, Saint Chao Yang appeared with another Celestial Being, launching an attack on the Golden Peng Bird. A fierce battle erupted, attracting another Celestial Being.]<br/><br/>[You were captured by Saint Chao Yang and taken to Taoyuan Heaven. A year later, you died when your primary energy source was exhausted, at the age of 23.]<br/><br/>Is that even possible?<br/><br/>Gu Yang was dumfounded.<br/><br/>He was actually fancied by a beast and taken to its nest.<br/><br/>If it hadn’t just laid eggs and was incubating them, wouldn’t his innocence be lost?<br/><br/>Thinking about it made his scalp tingle.<br/><br/>This damned charm will one day be the death of him.<br/><br/>He shook his head, throwing the horrifying thoughts to the back of his mind. Anyway, he would stay as far away as possible from the Golden Peng Bird’s nest next time he encountered one.<br/><br/>“Cui’er burst my Beast-taming Space, it seems its level is very high, far surpassing the golden body realm.”<br/><br/>Gu Yang was a little bit upset. He wasted a simulation opportunity for this experiment.<br/><br/>Subsequently, he met Shen Yun, was fancied by the Golden Peng Bird, Saint Chao Yang was drawn in… the plot got messed up from there.<br/><br/>[Simulation ends, you may retain one of the following.]<br/><br/>After pondering for a bit, Gu Yang chose option two.<br/><br/>Immediately, his mind has added memories from several battles.<br/><br/>His battle with Shen Yun and his fight with the Roc bird.<br/><br/>The speed of the Roc was simply too fast. Even after he transformed into a phoenix, he still couldn’t beat it. This Roc’s realm far surpassed his own, and even the Divine Ape, who shares the same ancient divine beast bloodline, was no match for it.<br/><br/>Last of all, it was the fight when he was caught by Celestial Being realm experts from the Immortal Palace.<br/><br/>That wasn’t even a proper fight, it was an absolute crush. The enemy was using a magical tool, a white jade gourd, which absorbed him and the Golden Roc when it was pointed at them.<br/><br/>There was no room for resistance whatsoever.<br/><br/>The white jade gourd must be a spiritual treasure of exceptionally high rank, and one that held formidable power.<br/><br/>In Great Zhou, almost none of the spiritual treasures held such powerful abilities.<br/><br/>This was true for the previous Demon Suppression Tower and the Nine Divine Ding in his possession.<br/><br/>The power of these treasures was not very strong.<br/><br/>It’s very likely that their primordial spirits have fallen into a slumber or have dissipated entirely.<br/><br/>So, that left the question: why could the spiritual treasures of the Immortal Palace still retain such formidable power that they could so easily capture a celestial beast?<br/><br/>Gu Yang thought this was why the Immortal Palace was so invincible. It was due to their strong spiritual treasures, which could easily defeat celestial beings from other realms.<br/><br/>“Again.”<br/><br/>Gu Yang launched the simulation once more. Although he had wasted one simulation, he still gained something from it.<br/><br/>[…You went to Hell Valley on the Ruiqin Continent and captured the Immortal Underworld Phoenix alive, extracting two drops of phoenix essence blood…]<br/><br/>[…In the Beast God Temple, your beast-taming space leveled up again, advancing you to a quasi-master beastmaster.]<br/><br/>[…You are 31 years old.]<br/><br/>Thus, he continuously simulated with a clear target — the phoenix essence blood.<br/><br/>Until the seventh simulation —<br/><br/>[…After absorbing two drops of phoenix essence blood, your Divine Phoenix Art has broken through to the 7th level…]<br/><br/>[…In the Beast God Temple, your beast-taming space rises again, promoting you to the top master beastmaster.]<br/><br/>[…You are 31 years old.]<br/><br/>He had succeeded!<br/><br/>A feeling of jubilance filled Gu Yang’s heart. The phoenix transformation had reached the 7th level, which possesses the strength of the Unleaking Realm.<br/><br/>Now, having two divine beast incarnations of the Unleaking Realm, he had no fear in facing any Unleaking Realm expert.<br/><br/>The level of the Beastmaster has also reached the third heavenly level of mana.<br/><br/>Not because his talent for this was particularly strong. Rather, it was because his beast-taming space leveled up quickly when he was in the Beast God Temple.<br/><br/>It was speculated that because the Ruiqin Continent was hovering on the brink of life and death, the master of the Beast God Temple is intentionally helping Beastmasters boost their strength. With taking on so many benefits, reaching this stage isn’t surprising at all.<br/><br/>[Simulation ends, you may retain one of the following.]<br/><br/>“I choose option one.”<br/><br/>With a loud boom, a flame bursts forth from Gu Yang’s brow. In a blink of an eye, it ascends into the sky.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to him, the sky was filled with gathering dark clouds.<br/><br/>Just moments ago, the sky was clear. Now, as far as his naked eye could see, there was nothing but thick clouds that covered the sky, plunging the day into darkness in an instant.<br/><br/>Boom!<br/><br/>Within the rolling dark clouds, flashes of lightning that resembled silver snakes surged through.<br/><br/>The phoenix flew with a long tail between the clouds, with countless bolts of lightning striking its body.<br/><br/>It let out a long, clear call, and the flames on its feathers grew more and more intense.<br/><br/>Over a hundred leagues away, there was a large vessel drifting on the seas.<br/><br/>Judging from the shape of the ship, it appeared to be an ocean freighter from West Bank Continent.<br/><br/>At the moment, the people aboard the ship were in a panic, frantically retracting the sails. The sudden change in weather was incredibly hazardous to ships at sea.<br/><br/>Taking a moment’s delay in dealing with this could mean the destruction of the ship and the death of its crew.<br/><br/>At the prow of the ship stood an old man and a young boy, their heads lifted to the sudden dark clouds in the sky.<br/><br/>The boy asked curiously, “Master, why did such a large cloud suddenly appear?”<br/><br/>The old man’s expression was somewhat solemn as he said, “A formidable monster is experiencing a tribulation.”<br/><br/>“A monster? What’s that?”<br/><br/>The boy, having grown up in West Bank Continent and despite speaking the official language of Great Zhou, was unknowledgeable about many things.<br/><br/>The old man used a term from the West Bank Continent, saying, “That’s an advanced magical beast.”<br/><br/>The boy was taken aback, “We’ve actually encountered an advanced magical beast?”<br/><br/>Boom!<br/><br/>Suddenly, a tremendously thick bolt of lightning appeared to split the sky in two, striking down from above like a divine punishment.<br/><br/>The boy felt as if he could neither hear nor see anything. His vision was blinding white. His mind was in shock and he found it hard to put his feelings into words.<br/><br/>His young mind, under the force of nature, was left speechless.<br/><br/>When everything cleared up, all he could see was a divine bird soaring between heaven and earth. It was so proud and pure. Even in the face of nature’s wrath, it showed no sign of retreat.<br/><br/>The old man next to him exclaimed, “Is that a phoenix?”<br/><br/>Just then, a terrifying aura rapidly approached.<br/><br/>This time the boy recognized what it was and exclaimed, “It’s a Sword Saint!”<br/><br/>In West Bank Continent, Sword Saints are peak warriors of their knight classification. Every single one of them is famous across the continent.<br/><br/>The boy had lived in West Bank Continent since he was young, and this was his first trip back to Great Zhou.<br/><br/>Who would have thought that before they even reached the shore, they would encounter an advanced magical beast and a Sword Saint. This left a deep impression on him.<br/><br/>A majestic voice echoed, “Gu Yang, you cannot escape!”<br/><br/>PS: First update, monthly ticket wanted.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
