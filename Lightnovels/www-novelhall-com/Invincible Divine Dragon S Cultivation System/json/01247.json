It had nothing to do with the Alliance of Justice Sequence and the Alliance of evil sequence.<br/><br/>Therefore, the powerhouses of the heaven-origin creation in the nine-origin universe did not have a deep understanding of the Alliance of Justice Sequence! However, the Alliance of Justice sequence was a good place for Wang Xian to make a trade.<br/><br/>He would exchange the treasures that he did not use for useful resources.<br/><br/>After chatting with the four heaven origin creator powerhouses in the mountain universe for a while, Wang Xian began to devour the resources in the main hall.<br/><br/>The resources that the mountain universe took out this time were extremely huge.<br/><br/>Although it was not enough for him to make a breakthrough, he could still make a huge improvement.<br/><br/>“After exchanging the corpse of the river-migrating beast emperor for resources, I will be able to make a breakthrough!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at his attributes and smiled!<br/><br/>As long as he could achieve another breakthrough, Wang Xian would have the strength of the Great Dao level without relying on treasures.<br/><br/>In addition to the ancestral tree, the body of the Void Divine Dragon, the Five Elements Millstone, and the Tai Chi Dragon Disc.<br/><br/>Wang Yun was equivalent to a level 15 existence. In other words, he was six levels higher than those who had just stepped into the Great Dao level. (a level-I is equivalent to stepping into the Heavenly Yuan blessed realm.)<br/><br/>In other words, Wang Xian’s strength was comparable to one who had just stepped into the Great Dao realm and two who had just stepped into the control realm.<br/><br/>This strength was considered a very powerful existence in the Great Dao realm.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Wang Xian was confident that by that time, the abilities of the Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor would be 90% inferior to his!<br/><br/>This was not even taking into account the situation of Lin Niu and the rest.<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. Ten years passed very quickly!<br/><br/>The Blood Naga universe had completely retreated from the mountain range universe.<br/><br/>The powerhouses from the mountain range universe had been following the Blood Naza universe’s army for a long time.<br/><br/>When they saw that they had completely left, they heaved a sigh of relief!<br/><br/>“Ten years have passed. Everyone, Farewell!”<br/><br/>Ten years had passed, and the time that Wang Xian had agreed with them had also come to an end.<br/><br/>He cupped his hands toward the four heaven origin creation stage powerhouses in the mountain range universe and said!<br/><br/>“Thank you again, Dragon King, for helping us to resolve the crisis! ”<br/><br/>The four heaven origin creation stage powerhouses in the mountain range universe bowed respectfully!<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and looked at huming mountain beside him. “Huming<br/><br/>Mountain, you should go back first. Pll make a trip to the Justice Universe! ”<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King. Please be careful, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Hu Mingshan nodded.<br/><br/>He did not follow Wang Xian on an adventure!<br/><br/>He had just made a breakthrough and needed to stabilize himself. In addition, he needed to return to the Divine Tiger clan.<br/><br/>He was not prepared to take any risks in this calamity. Instead, he wanted to increase the strength of the Divine Tiger clan first.<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not return because it was much closer to the universe of justice from here than from the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>It would only take a few thousand years to fly from here.<br/><br/>However, it would take tens of thousands of years or even hundreds of thousands of years to fly from the nine-origin universe!<br/><br/>The Justice Universe was still very far away from the nine-origin universe!<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head and flew in the direction of the Justice Universe.<br/><br/>The Justice Universe was also known as the Justice Alliance universe.<br/><br/>It was the universe where the founder of the Justice Sequence Alliance was located.<br/><br/>It was also the most powerful universe of the Justice Sequence Alliance.<br/><br/>It was rumored that there were chaos-level existences guarding this universe.<br/><br/>Of course, this was only a legend. As for whether there were such existences, it was unknown!<br/><br/>Wang Xian entered the long flying time again!<br/><br/>In the nine-origin universe, the return of Huming Mountain to the Divine Tiger clan caused a huge shock to the entire divine tiger clan.<br/><br/>Their Divine Tiger Clan had a heaven origin creation level existence!<br/><br/>Their Lord Tiger Cry Mountain had broken through to the heaven origin creation realm!<br/><br/>And when Tiger Cry Mountain returned to the Divine Tiger clan, he immediately announced something, causing a huge shock to the entire nine-origin universe!<br/><br/>” Dragon Palace’s Lord Dragon King is my Tiger Cry Mountain’s benefactor, and in the future, the Dragon Palace will also be our Divine Tiger clan’s benefactor. I, Tiger Cry Mountain, Owe Lord Dragon King a huge favor. In the future, if Lord Dragon King has any moves, I will definitely respond! ”<br/><br/>The voice of Tiger Roar Mountain shocked the experts of the other races in the nine-origin universe!<br/><br/>“What? What’s going on? Why did the Divine Tiger Clan’s heavenly creation realm expert, who had just broken through, make such a statement?”<br/><br/>(‘F * CK, are you serious? If the Divine Tiger clan made such a statement, doesn’t that mean that the Divine Tiger clan will respect the Dragon King in the future?”<br/><br/>“Now, in our nine-origin universe, the Celestial Nation will definitely respect the Dragon King. Now, there’s The Divine Tiger Clan? “The Dragon Palace is going to defy the heavens too. It’s unbelievable that a heavenly yuan creator-level powerhouse is willing to listen to the Dragon King’s orders!”<br/><br/>The entire nine-origin universe was in an uproar.<br/><br/>Countless disciples widened their eyes.<br/><br/>Even the heavenly yuan creator-level powerhouses from the other peak races were astonished.<br/><br/>Soon, they also received a piece of information from Tiger Roar Mountain.<br/><br/>This time, Tiger Roar Mountain was able to break through because of the Dragon King.<br/><br/>Tiger Roar Mountain had found a universe that could break through, but this universe had encountered the invasion of a powerful evil sequence faction.<br/><br/>There were seven Heavenly Kismet realm powerhouses, and two of them were at the control level.<br/><br/>The Dragon King had made a deal with the powerhouses of this universe to help this universe expel foreign enemies, and had traded a spot!<br/><br/>Only then did the Tiger Roar Mountain achieve a breakthrough.<br/><br/>Under such circumstances, the Tiger Roar Mountain had indeed owed the Dragon King a huge favor.<br/><br/>The actions of the Tiger Roar Mountain and the actions of the Divine Tiger clan were also normal!<br/><br/>After this incident, the prestige of the Dragon Palace had once again received a terrifying boost!<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not know what had happened in the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>He was rapidly heading towards the righteous universe.<br/><br/>Thousands of years passed by quickly. Wang Xian was getting closer and closer to the Justice Universe!<br/><br/>When he flew for another few months, he met more and more strong disciples in the surrounding chaos.<br/><br/>He even saw groups of disciples at the venerable level shuttling through the chaos.<br/><br/>He saw a huge battleship flying in the CHAOS!<br/><br/>This surprised Wang Xian greatly.<br/><br/>The chaos was extremely dangerous. For a supremacy level existence to dare to fly here, this also meant that this place was very safe.<br/><br/>“It seems that we have entered the vicinity of the Justice Universe. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled, “The radiation strength of the justice universe is still very strong! ”<br/><br/>The core of the Justice Sequence Alliance was the Justice Universe. There were dozens of universes in the vicinity.<br/><br/>Among these dozens of universes, there were even teleportation arrays that could be used for long-distance communication.<br/><br/>It might only take a few years to teleport over.<br/><br/>Although the mountain universe was also part of the Justice Sequence Alliance, it had yet to reach them.<br/><br/>The mountain universe was considered to be at the edge.<br/><br/>As they continued to fly forward, the number of strong disciples in the surrounding void increased!<br/><br/>Wang Xian even saw a powerful beast carriage pulling a luxurious palanquin.<br/><br/>Inside the palanquin was an existence at the Heaven’s fate level.<br/><br/>He saw flying vehicles that were like spaceships shuttling rapidly!<br/><br/>With a glance, he could see thousands of living beings.<br/><br/>The density was extremely high!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
