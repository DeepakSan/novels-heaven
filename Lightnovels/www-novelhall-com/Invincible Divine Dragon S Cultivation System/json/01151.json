It was easy for him to treat a universe knight.<br/><br/>“Foster father, is mother… Is She Alright?”<br/><br/>Tianci stood at the side nervously. When he saw Wang Xian retracting his arm, he asked anxiously.<br/><br/>“She’s fine. Don’t be anxious! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian patted his shoulder and stood up.<br/><br/>Mu Liyin ‘er’s eyebrows twitched and her face regained its color. She looked at the people around her and sat up hurriedly.<br/><br/>“Mom, Are You Alright?”<br/><br/>Tianci asked with concern.<br/><br/>“I’m alright. All the injuries on my body have disappeared! ”<br/><br/>Mu Liyin ‘er sensed for a moment and shook her head. She looked at Wang Xian and said, “Thank you, young master Wang Xian, for treating me! ”<br/><br/>“It’s just a small problem! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head and said, “The injuries on your body are very serious. The other party wants to cripple you completely. Fighting and killing are prohibited in the underground city. May I know… ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian opened his mouth and asked. Mu Liyin’er’s father, brother, and the rest were also staring at him angrily.<br/><br/>They had sensed mu Liyin’er’s injuries earlier.<br/><br/>It was very serious.<br/><br/>It could be said that she was only left with her last breath!<br/><br/>Furthermore, Mu Liyin’er was sent here by someone. They didn’t know the exact situation.<br/><br/>“It was me who was fighting with someone in the arena that caused my injuries to be so serious!”<br/><br/>Mu Li Yin ‘er sat up, her expression slightly changed.<br/><br/>“Yin c er, who did you duel with? Why did you duel with someone?”<br/><br/>Mu Li Yin ‘er’s mother hurriedly asked.<br/><br/>“Mother, it’s… The people from the Black Earth tribe.”<br/><br/>Mu Li Yin ‘er said in a low voice!<br/><br/>“Little sister, you’re talking about that fellow Liao Feiyu. That fellow has been pestering you all this while, and now he’s actually injured you. How<br/><br/>Outrageous! ”<br/><br/>One of Mu Li Yin’er’s big brothers said with a face full of anger.<br/><br/>“It’s not him, it’s his sister. Forget it! ”<br/><br/>Mu Li Yin ‘er shook her head and said.<br/><br/>“Mom, we can’t let it go like this. They actually dared to hit you. I want to seek justice for you!”<br/><br/>Tianci, who was standing at the side, said with a face full of anger.<br/><br/>“Forget it. This was originally a duel in the arena, and the other party was from the Black Earth tribe!”<br/><br/>Mu Li Yin ‘er shook her head at him and looked at her parents and brother. “Dad, Mom, Pm fine now. Let’s forget it.” “This…<br/><br/>Mu Li Yin ‘er’s father’s expression changed.<br/><br/>“Tianci, Pm fine. Cultivate well and strive for first place!”<br/><br/>Mu Li Yin ‘er stood up and patted Tianci’s head!<br/><br/>“Okay, Mom! ”<br/><br/>Tianci could only nod helplessly when he saw that his mother didn’t want to tell him anything.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. Let your mother rest for a while. ” Wang Xian patted tianci and said to him.<br/><br/>Okay!<br/><br/>Tianci nodded and left with Wang Xian with his head lowered.<br/><br/>“Foster father, we can’t just let go of my mother’s matter!”<br/><br/>Tianci walked out of the room and looked at Wang Xian. There was determination in his eyes as he spoke.<br/><br/>“Of course we can’t just let it Go! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at him and said, “Your mother was hurt so badly by someone else. Naturally, we have to take revenge. Not only do we have to take revenge, we also have to make him pay a terrible price. Do you still remember what I told you before?”<br/><br/>“We don’t provoke others. However, if someone were to provoke us and our family members, we will have to pay ten times or even a hundred times the price!<br/><br/>Tianci took over and said while clenching his fist!<br/><br/>“That’s right. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded. (‘I have already asked Linniu to investigate this matter. There will be news soon! ”<br/><br/>“Thank you, foster father. ”<br/><br/>Tianci said to Wang Xian gratefully.<br/><br/>“No need. There aren’t many peaceful days left! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at him and said.<br/><br/>Tianci was slightly stunned when he heard his words. He looked at Wang Xian with some doubt.<br/><br/>“Lin Niu is back. Let’s go to my room! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not tell Tianci the specific situation. He brought him to his room.<br/><br/>Although Wang Xian and the rest had been staying in earth city, he still had some understanding of the situation in the outside world.<br/><br/>In particular, Wang Xian had received a piece of news previously.<br/><br/>The news came from the other heaven origin creation stage powerhouses in the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>In the group chat of the other heaven origin creation stage powerhouses, they discussed about the current six paths universe’s heaven origin creation Supreme Treasure.<br/><br/>Now, there was news that the Heaven Origin Creation Supreme Treasure was located in the Earth Plain of the six paths universe.<br/><br/>After Wang Xian received this news, he had a guess in his heart!<br/><br/>This news must have been spread by the powerhouse of Tianyuan who was originally from Guangming.<br/><br/>As for the purpose, it was probably for Tianci.<br/><br/>Therefore, Tianci didn’t have much time for peace.<br/><br/>It wouldn’t be long before he was completely exposed.<br/><br/>“Boss!”<br/><br/>After entering the room, Lin Niu was already waiting there.<br/><br/>“What’s the exact situation?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked.<br/><br/>“Boss, it’s like this. During this period of time, a young man from the Xuan Tu tribe named Liao Feiyu was infatuated with Tianci’s mother. However, his mother rejected him many times. This news was found out by Liao Feiyu’s sister. His sister also knew about Tianci’s mother’s identity and situation. As she was very dissatisfied with her, she caused trouble twice. This time, she even provoked him into entering the arena and severely injured him. ”<br/><br/>Lin Niu reported.<br/><br/>A heaven chosen youth from the Black Earth tribe had taken a liking to Mu Li Yin ‘er, but was rejected by Mu Li Yin C er. Later on, he pestered her relentlessly!<br/><br/>After being discovered by his sister, he found out about Mu Li Yin ‘er’s identity and situation. He was extremely displeased and displeased.<br/><br/>He angrily rebuked Mu Li Yin ‘er for being a vixen and not worthy of his younger brother.<br/><br/>That was why he taught Mu Li Yin ‘er a lesson and severely injured her.<br/><br/>“My mother didn’t provoke them at all, yet they went overboard! ”<br/><br/>When Tianci heard that, he immediately flew into a rage and shouted with a cold face!<br/><br/>“Liao Feiyu’s elder sister is called Liao Feiyan. They are both ranked in the Heaven’s pride group of the six paths meet. Currently, they have already entered the top ten. Both of their realms are at the peak of the Universe Knight<br/><br/>Realm. ”<br/><br/>Lin Niu continued his introduction!<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head slightly when he heard the details.<br/><br/>“The strength of a peak universe knight?”<br/><br/>Tianci’s eyes narrowed slightly when he heard that.<br/><br/>“Other than that, the Xuan Tu tribe is divided into four clans. The Liao clan is one of them. Their elders are also experts from the Liao clan. They have a lot of power! ”<br/><br/>Lin Niu added!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
