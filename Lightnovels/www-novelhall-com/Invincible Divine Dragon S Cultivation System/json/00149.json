The terrifying arrows gathered the power of wind and thunder and turned into a huge divine dragon that shot down.<br/><br/>Hong! Hong! Hong<br/><br/>A terrifying explosion sounded.<br/><br/>“Defend, defend immediately!”<br/><br/>Below, a great being of the Dragon Race roared loudly.<br/><br/>“Peng! Peng! Peng!”<br/><br/>In the sky, a powerful door of darkness appeared. The arrows landed on it and caused the door of darkness to quickly collapse.<br/><br/>“Brothers, Charge!”<br/><br/>A Universe Knight level mad dragon roared and charged downwards.<br/><br/>“Kill!”<br/><br/>“Kill!”<br/><br/>Starwood Dragon, Sky Thunder Earth Fire Dragon Phoenix, imperial dragon and other dragon species were the first to charge forward.<br/><br/>Among the 500,000 members of the Dragon Palace, none of them were weaker than a universe Knight Level 4.<br/><br/>Among them, there were more than 50 Pinnacle Emperors of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“War Machine, Dragon Cannon!”<br/><br/>A loud roar came from below.<br/><br/>Crack! Crack! Crack<br/><br/>Then, huge black cannons appeared on the mountains below.<br/><br/>The head of the cannons was like the head of a divine dragon, and a terrifying energy was brewing on it.<br/><br/>The strength of a race was not only the strength of their disciples, but also the strength of their war machine.<br/><br/>The dragon cannons were specially prepared for war.<br/><br/>One shot could destroy a planet.<br/><br/>There were more than a thousand dragon cannons aimed at all the members of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Boom!

It is indeed extraordinary.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked over, his eyes shining.<br/><br/>After killing six universe knights of the Dragon Race and the nine swords race, the combat strength of the Dragon Palace’s knight level had reached 33.<br/><br/>Even if he, prime minister turtle, and Xiao Lan didn’t make a move, there were still more than 20 universe knights.<br/><br/>More than 20 universe knights couldn’t defeat the dragon-born race in an instant. One could imagine how deep their foundations were.<br/><br/>“The headquarters of every race is built extremely sturdy.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Turtle echoed from the side and scanned the surroundings. “However, their destruction is only a matter of time.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.<br/><br/>What? .<br/><br/>“What? ! The Dragon Tribe sent a message of support. The Dragon Palace has invaded the Dragon tribe.”<br/><br/>At this moment, in the faraway land of the nine swords tribe.<br/><br/>The leader of the nine swords tribe looked at the message sent by the leader of the Dragon tribe with a face full of shock.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace had actually gone to attack the Dragon tribe.<br/><br/>This…<br/><br/>“Nine blade race sword team, prepare to follow the leader to support the dragon race.”<br/><br/>A figure quickly spread throughout the nine blade race land.<br/><br/>Hearing this voice, everyone’s expression changed.<br/><br/>The remaining universe knight immediately flew into the palace, his expression grave.<br/><br/>“Leader, the Dragon Race…”<br/><br/>As he spoke, the clan leader of the nine-blade race nodded and looked extremely embarrassed.<br/><br/>“Search, search, search!”<br/><br/>At this time, Great Beings from the nine-blade race flew over from the front of the palace.<br/><br/>After the nine-blade race and the Dragon Race joined forces, they established an army and were ready for any preparations.<br/><br/>The Sword Group was a powerful army formed by the nine-blade race in advance. After the two secret armies were destroyed, the sword group was the strongest fighting army of the nine-blade race.<br/><br/>“Let’s go, we’ll head to the dragon-descendant clan immediately.”<br/><br/>The nine swords clan leader swept his gaze across all the disciples and shouted in a deep voice.<br/><br/>Now that the dragon-descendant clan was under attack, once the Dragon-descendant clan was destroyed, it would be their turn.<br/><br/>At this time, he had no choice but to go and support them.<br/><br/>The group of people moved and immediately flew towards the teleportation array.<br/><br/>Now that the teleportation array of the two clans had been opened, they could be directly teleported to the inner regions of the dragon-descendant clan.<br/><br/>“The dragon-descendant race has been invaded by the Dragon Palace. This… this…”<br/><br/>In the land of the nine swords race, everyone was shocked when they saw their clan leader leading a group of experts to support the dragon-descendant race.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace had invaded the dragon-descendant race.<br/><br/>“Nine swords, come and support us!”<br/><br/>At the same time, the clan leader of the nine swords race led a million disciples to rush out from the inner part of the dragon-descendant race.<br/><br/>They swept across the battlefield and shouted in a deep voice.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
