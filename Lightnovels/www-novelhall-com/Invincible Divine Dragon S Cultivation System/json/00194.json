It seems that I can get quite a lot of them.”<br/><br/>“The best thing is that I can get my hands on the Sky Sea Dragon Palace and kill the Sky Sea Dragon King.”<br/><br/>In the herb garden of the Sky Sea Dragon Palace, Wang Xian passed through the powers of law and gathered the divine herbs and divine fruits in the herb garden.<br/><br/>Towards the end, he even found a level four dragon blood herb of a universe knight. This made him extremely excited.<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>At this moment, a familiar aura was attracted over. Wang Xian looked over and saw the figure of the willow deity in a medicinal garden in front of him.<br/><br/>He moved and flew over immediately.<br/><br/>“Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The willow deity also sensed Wang Xian’s aura and immediately went up to him. “Dragon King, what happened to the Sky Sea Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>After she was separated from Wang Xian, she was transferred to a medicinal garden.<br/><br/>The medicinal garden had a terrifying sealing force. With her strength, she was unable to break through the defense of the power of law.<br/><br/>When she exhausted all her methods, the sky sea dragon palace trembled. It was only after the power of law weakened that she came out from there.<br/><br/>Along the way, she also obtained a lot of divine herbs and fruits.<br/><br/>“The Sky Sea Dragon King didn’t fall. This was all his plan. The Sky Sea Dragon King became his chess piece. They wanted to steal my bloodline but failed.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said calmly.<br/><br/>“HMM? The Tianhai Dragon King didn’t Fall? No wonder the Dragon Palace is operating so well.”<br/><br/>The Willow Deity’s eyes were shining.<br/><br/>“Now that the Tianhai Dragon King is severely injured, his control over the dragon palace has been greatly reduced. The attack and defense here have been weakened to the limit. I reckon that the Dragon Gate can easily enter.”<br/><br/>“Let’s go deeper and see if we can find the Sky Sea Dragon King and destroy them.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said as he looked deeper.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The willow deity nodded and the two of them flew straight ahead.<br/><br/>The willow deity had the ability to kill a universe knight at level four. With the current defense of the Sky Sea Dragon Palace, it wouldn’t be of much use.<br/><br/>The two of them quickly shuttled through the herb garden and gathered the spiritual herbs before heading deeper.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian and the rest entered deeper into the herb garden, tens of millions of demonic beasts swarmed into the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>They were frantically searching for opportunities in the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>When they entered, the group of people in the herb garden noticed that the power of laws was weakened and immediately entered.<br/><br/>The entire Dragon Palace had lost all control.<br/><br/>At this moment, the Tianhai Dragon King, who was in the Dragon King’s Palace, no longer cared about the matters in the Dragon Palace. He wanted to completely fuse with this body.<br/><br/>“Eh? is the Dragon King’s Palace in front of us?”<br/><br/>After more than an hour, Wang Xian and the rest passed through the huge herb garden. They stared at the building in front and raised their eyebrows slightly.<br/><br/>The huge ocean-pacifying needle was located in the center of the building. A huge staircase extended all the way into the building.<br/><br/>The two sculptures of the Divine Dragons were located on both sides of the building.<br/><br/>However, the building in front of them was enveloped by a vast energy.<br/><br/>Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and exchanged a glance with the willow deity. Then, he walked forward.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>When the two of them arrived in front of the building, a surge of energy stopped them from advancing.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the willow deity.<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>The willow deity waved its arm and transformed into a willow tree. Then, it struck directly at the defense in front of them.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>A powerful force landed on it, causing the defense in front of it to tremble violently.<br/><br/>“HMM? Someone is attacking the Dragon King’s palace from the outside.”<br/><br/>The Tianhai Dragon King, who was lying in the Dragon King’s palace, sensed the trembling of the Dragon King’s palace and his expression changed slightly.<br/><br/>He stared coldly at the outside.<br/><br/>When he saw Wang Xian and the Willow God outside, his expression turned abnormally ugly.<br/><br/>“This darn fellow, I will rip your tendons and skin you sooner or later.”<br/><br/>He growled in a low voice. His eyes were filled with killing intent.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>His expression changed as he looked around. With a wave of his arm, a wave of energy enveloped the entire Dragon King Palace.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>Outside, the willow deity sensed the defense of the Dragon King Palace. Her eyes sparkled as she continued her attack.<br/><br/>However, when her attack landed in front of her, the Dragon King’s palace in front of her disappeared instantly.<br/><br/>“Eh? This Is?”<br/><br/>The Willow Goddess was slightly stunned as she revealed a stunned expression.<br/><br/>“He has been moved. This is the Dragon Palace of the Tianhai Dragon King. Even though his control over the dragon palace has been greatly reduced, he can still control some of it.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the empty space in front of him. He raised his eyebrows and continued, “It seems that the situation of the Tianhai Dragon King is not looking good at the moment.”<br/><br/>The disappearance of the entire huge Dragon King Palace had turned the area in front of them into ruins.<br/><br/>The building that appeared behind the ruins made Wang Xian look surprised.<br/><br/>Behind the Dragon King Palace were numerous huge tombstones.<br/><br/>Each tombstone was about 10,000 meters in size, and there were names carved on it.<br/><br/>“This is? The graveyard of the Tianhai Dragon Palace? The subordinates and relatives of the Tianhai Dragon King who died?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s body moved and immediately flew forward.<br/><br/>The Tianhai Dragon Palace was different from the Dragon Palace. Behind the Dragon Palace was the dragon transformation pool, while the Tianhai Dragon Palace was the graveyard.<br/><br/>Obviously, the existence of the dragon transformation pool was something that the Divine Dragon Clan didn’t have in the past.<br/><br/>This was the divine dragon system, created by combining the abilities of the insect clan.<br/><br/>This was also one of the reasons why the Dragon Palace defied the natural order.<br/><br/>Arriving in front of the cemeteries, his eyes sparkled as he looked below the tombstones.<br/><br/>Below, he saw the corpses of the divine dragons.<br/><br/>The flesh and blood on the corpses had completely disappeared, leaving only the dragon bones.<br/><br/>The dragon bones were also a huge resource for the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Not to mention the Divine Dragon Clan, the corpses of any powerful creature were a huge treasure trove.<br/><br/>“If the skysea Dragon King doesn’t want to plunder my bloodline or kill me, I would definitely not touch the bones of the Divine Dragon Clan.”<br/><br/>“But now, there’s no need at all.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled, his eyes flashing with a cold expression.<br/><br/>Logically speaking, these were all his seniors. He should respect the dead members of the Divine Dragon Clan.<br/><br/>However, since the Tianhai Dragon King wanted to kill him, he didn’t have to worry about anything.<br/><br/>In the Tianhai Dragon Palace, he would take away all the treasures that could be taken away.<br/><br/>“Willow deity, take out all the dragon bones in the Dragon Tomb.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke as his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The willow deity nodded. One by one, she reached into the soil and dug out the dragon bones one by one.<br/><br/>Wang Xian also started to move. Huge dragon bones were unearthed one by one.<br/><br/>The dragon bones in the dragon tomb were not all the bones of purebred divine dragons.<br/><br/>He realized that there were many dragon bones of other lesser dragons. However, he could feel that the strength of each dragon bone was definitely not lower than that of a universe knight when they were alive.<br/><br/>In fact, the level of these dragon bones was not lower than a level five universe knight.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at these dragon bones with a burning look in his eyes.<br/><br/>The last time he improved, he absorbed a powerful dragon bone. This time, with so many dragon bones and the godly herb he obtained, his strength could definitely improve.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
