This treasure is too rich. Even to us, the Lich race, it’s a huge treasure!”<br/><br/>The Lich in the center stared at the spot in front of him with burning eyes.<br/><br/>What entered his eyes were many golden god countries, and each god country contained a huge amount of power.<br/><br/>At a glance, they were like endless gold.<br/><br/>Sacred and vast!<br/><br/>The divine kingdoms of every expert were the habitat that this expert had spent his entire life building. They were the most precious existences in their lives.<br/><br/>The value of these divine kingdoms was extremely terrifying.<br/><br/>“These treasures, even if placed in the heaven opening primal continent, are enough to cause a race to start a war and fight over them.”<br/><br/>A Lich’s eyes were shining. The wings on his back flapped rapidly as he flew forward. “These divine kingdoms all belong to our lich race.”<br/><br/>“Immediately set up an array. Get the patriarch and the others to rush over and take away all the Divine Kingdoms!”<br/><br/>The Lich in the center ordered.<br/><br/>With so many divine kingdoms, they couldn’t take them away even if they wanted to.<br/><br/>However, as a powerful Lich clan, they naturally had their own methods.<br/><br/>The Lich on the left was like a thin, flat fish. His body squirmed and slowly grew larger.<br/><br/>Finally, he became a hundred kilometers in size.<br/><br/>His body emitted a strange luster.<br/><br/>“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”<br/><br/>After a few dozen seconds, figures slowly appeared on his body.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, Aske, well done, well done!”<br/><br/>A lich with the head of a demonic dragon, body like a snake, tail like a bird, and more than ten long arms appeared.<br/><br/>He swept his gaze around, his eyes shining with excitement as he roared loudly.<br/><br/>Each of these figures had an abnormally terrifying aura.<br/><br/>Especially around the lich leader, every aura was terrifying.<br/><br/>This was the aura of a level 8 knight.<br/><br/>There were about 10 of them emitting such a terrifying aura.<br/><br/>The Lich clan, they belonged to the wizard lineage, they had once received the inheritance of an ancestral wizard.<br/><br/>Their powers were all extremely strange and terrifying.<br/><br/>Their bodies seemed to be joined together, strange and horrifying.<br/><br/>“Clan leader, in case things go wrong, let’s take all of them!”<br/><br/>The Lich named Aske said with a smile.<br/><br/>“Haha, such a treasure belongs to our liches. Anyone who wants to snatch it is our enemy. Even if the Dragon Palace wants to snatch it from us, we will kill them!”<br/><br/>The Lich leader laughed out loud and roared furiously. He waved his hand at his subordinates.<br/><br/>“That’s right. We only need to be wary of the potential of the Dragon Palace, but that’s all. If we really fight, we can destroy the Dragon Palace as well.”<br/><br/>A Lich said with a smile and flew towards the Cosmos God country ahead.<br/><br/>He waved his arm and immediately set up an array to temporarily move these God countries into his own God country.<br/><br/>There were more than 100 of them, and the weakest among them was only a level-six universe knight.<br/><br/>They were very fast, and within a few minutes, more than 1,000 God countries had been taken by them.<br/><br/>“Who is it!”<br/><br/>At that moment, the gaze of the Lich clan leader, who was floating in the void space, suddenly turned cold, and his pair of blood-red dragon eyes stared at a spot in the void space.<br/><br/>With a wave of his arm, a dragon head condensed from dark laws shot toward that area of void space.<br/><br/>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Lord Lich King. We’re just passing by, we’re just passing by!”<br/><br/>About 800 million kilometers away, more than a dozen figures hurriedly dodged to the side with cold sweat on their faces.<br/><br/>They looked at the Lich clan leader who was overflowing with demonic flames, their faces filled with reverence.<br/><br/>“Get lost, or this king will exterminate all of you!”<br/><br/>The Lich clan leader, also known as the Lich King, stared coldly at the dozen or so people, his gaze cold!<br/><br/>“Yes, yes!”<br/><br/>The dozen or so figures immediately responded.<br/><br/>“Go, Go!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the dozen or so figures hurriedly retreated, their expressions somewhat unsightly.<br/><br/>“I didn’t expect the experts of the liches to actually come. Moreover, their search speed is so fast. Damn it!”<br/><br/>Among the dozen or so people, the middle-aged leader’s expression was somewhat unsightly as he growled in a low voice, “Within that divine kingdom, the densely packed divine kingdom is too shocking. If we can obtain it, our race will be able to obtain a huge increase in strength.”<br/><br/>“There’s nothing we can do. The liches are good at all kinds of sorcery, and we followed their tracks to get here. We’re one step behind them, and now the treasures of the Righteous God race belong to the liches. They’re too powerful.”<br/><br/>A middle-aged man beside him was a little envious, but he said helplessly.<br/><br/>Among them, the strongest was only a universe knight level seven, and the liches were indeed universe knights level eight.<br/><br/>And this time, most of the universe knight level eight great beings of the liches were here.<br/><br/>At this time, even if the army of the Dragon Palace arrived, they wouldn’t be able to take it away from the liches.<br/><br/>Their faces were full of helplessness. With such a great being here, they had no chance.<br/><br/>There was nothing they could do even if they were unwilling!<br/><br/>Sou<br/><br/>Just as they were talking, they saw a figure flying toward them at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>“Another powerhouse from the heaven-splitting primordial land has found this place?”<br/><br/>The group of people was slightly stunned. They looked over immediately and their faces were filled with astonishment.<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian, who was flying over, sensed the group of figures and frowned slightly.<br/><br/>He slowed down slightly and stared at the void in front of him.<br/><br/>“Not good!”<br/><br/>When he saw the golden light that dyed the void red, his expression changed slightly.<br/><br/>This was the light from the Divine Kingdom of the Righteous God race.<br/><br/>These divine kingdoms were hidden in the void crack and were directly taken out by someone.<br/><br/>His body moved and he continued to fly forward. His face was filled with killing intent.<br/><br/>“Why aren’t you getting lost? Die For me!”<br/><br/>However, the moment Wang Xian got closer, a terrifying dark force attacked him.<br/><br/>“Level Eight Universe Knight!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed this force and felt a chill in his heart. His eyes were filled with anger.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>He waved his arm and a destroyed ball went up to meet it.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>The sound of an explosion rang out. In the void in front, the lich king saw that his attack was blocked by an attack. He was slightly stunned and squinted his dragon eyes.<br/><br/>Only a level 8 universe knight could fight against his attack.<br/><br/>“The ones who should get lost are all of you. How dare you snatch the spoils of war from our Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at the strange and terrifying Lich King and said coldly.<br/><br/>“Huh? Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>In the Divine Kingdom of the Righteous God race, The Lich King heard Wang Xian’s words and his eyes focused.<br/><br/>The Lich King, who was taking away the divine kingdoms one by one, stopped what he was doing and looked over.<br/><br/>Their eyes were filled with fear.<br/><br/>So what if it was the Dragon Palace? What was there to fear!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
