However, the Xuan Tu tribe would definitely take revenge and punish him.<br/><br/>What would he do then?<br/><br/>Therefore, if he wanted to take revenge himself, he would have to do so in secret.<br/><br/>On the surface, he was not qualified.<br/><br/>At least, it would be under the circumstances where his adoptive father did not make a move.<br/><br/>“Your mother was bullied. As her son, it’s natural for you to make a move yourself. This is your responsibility and responsibility. You have the manliness of a man. However, if your identity can be exposed later, you can live a more peaceful life! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at him and said!<br/><br/>“Foster father, mother gave birth to me and raised me. She is the person closest to me and the person I have to protect all my life. Now that she is injured, even if she isn’t peaceful in the future, I will avenge my mother! ”<br/><br/>Tianci looked at Wang Xian and said with determination!<br/><br/>“I also want you to live a more ordinary life!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at him, “Once your identity is exposed, you have to leave this place with me. You have to leave the six paths universe and go to another universe. If that’s the case, your life will be greatly affected. You are still young and have yet to see some of your life. My Foster Father doesn’t want you to grow up too quickly! ”<br/><br/>After watching Tianci grow up for nearly 100 million years, he had already regarded him as his son.<br/><br/>Although parents hoped that their son could grow up as soon as possible.<br/><br/>However, parents hoped to see their son grow up happily every day.<br/><br/>They couldn’t let him follow him into the chaos to search for treasures without enjoying too much prosperity, right?<br/><br/>Let him spend hundreds of millions of years in the chaos in an instant!<br/><br/>As parents, they naturally didn’t want their children to live this kind of life.<br/><br/>Especially when they were young!<br/><br/>“Then, foster father, what… What should I do?”<br/><br/>Tianci looked at Wang Xian and opened his mouth to ask.<br/><br/>“There isn’t much time left. If you can delay it, then do it. I have some things to take a look at. Next, I will raise your water attribute strength to the peak of a universe knight. When that happens, you will use the same method as the arena to take revenge! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to tianci.<br/><br/>“HMM? Foster father, can you directly raise my strength to the peak of a universe knight?”<br/><br/>Tianci widened his eyes when he heard Wang Xian’s words. His face was filled with disbelief.<br/><br/>“Of course you can. Especially since your wood attribute has already reached the level four of a universe dominator. With the foundation of the wood attribute, I can even help you raise your wood attribute to the level four of a universe dominator. ”<br/><br/>“Of course, this is because I have the wood attribute as well. If other heaven origin powerhouses want to forcefully upgrade a person, they need to possess this attribute! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to tianci!<br/><br/>“Then… I have worked so hard to cultivate for so long to reach the level five of the Universe Knight. If I had your help, wouldn’t I not need to cultivate and directly upgrade my realm?”<br/><br/>Tianci was a little speechless!<br/><br/>“Sure, but this kind of life is not perfect! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and said, “What needs to be cultivated still needs to be cultivated! ”<br/><br/>“Alright, Foster Father, you are doing this for my own good. Whatever you say will be done!”<br/><br/>Tianci’s expression changed and he said helplessly!<br/><br/>“Next, I will help you to improve your strength to the peak of a universe knight so that you can have the ability to take revenge. For the challenge in the arena, if you can delay it for some time, then delay it for some time.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to him in the end!<br/><br/>Following that, he placed his palm on Tianci’s body and a majestic water attribute energy entered his body!<br/><br/>The Aura on Tianci’s body was increasing rapidly.<br/><br/>A Heaven origin creator could help the weak to break through forcefully.<br/><br/>All the heaven origin creators could do it.<br/><br/>In the nine origin universe, if a peak universe knight was trapped in this realm, a heaven origin creator could help him to break through easily.<br/><br/>Of course, there was still some consumption in helping him break through the shackles. This consumption needed to be made up by his own cultivation.<br/><br/>The Tianyuan creator would not usually do this kind of thing.<br/><br/>However, now that Wang Xian had the ancestral tree, his recovery ability was terrifying. He helped the weak to break through the shackles. Although there was also some consumption, it was much faster and much easier to recover!<br/><br/>When the energy surged into Tianci’s body, his realm began to rise rapidly.<br/><br/>Especially since his wood attribute realm had already reached the fourth level of a universe master, it was very easy for him to absorb and absorb the energy.<br/><br/>In just a few hours, Tianci’s strength had reached the pinnacle of a universe knight!<br/><br/>The speed of his improvement was extremely terrifying!<br/><br/>“Alright, with the strength of a peak universe knight, you should be able to become invincible below the level of a universe master after getting used to it! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to tianci, “As for how you plan to avenge your mother, you can decide for yourself! ”<br/><br/>“Thank you, foster father. You are too kind to me. Thank you, Foster Father!”<br/><br/>Tianci felt the strength in his body and opened his mouth. He couldn’t help but say excitedly to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>Wang Xian patted his head and signaled him to go on his own!<br/><br/>Tianci walked out of the room. His eyes were sparkling as he thought about how to avenge his mother!<br/><br/>This matter was no small matter to anyone who was a child.<br/><br/>If it wasn’t for the presence of his adoptive father, if it wasn’t for his adoptive father being a strong man…<br/><br/>It would have taken his mother hundreds of millions of years to fully recover.<br/><br/>After all, the Mu Li tribe would not have spent a large amount of treasures to treat a disciple at the universe knight level.<br/><br/>Such a serious injury, one could imagine how vicious the other party was!<br/><br/>He wanted to completely cripple the other party!<br/><br/>Fortunately, he had his adoptive father!<br/><br/>If not, what else could tianci do?<br/><br/>However, now that he had the power and his foster father behind him, he wanted to make the person who hurt his mother pay ten times or a hundred times the price!<br/><br/>“Liao Feiyan, Liao Feiyu! ”<br/><br/>Tianci muttered coldly.<br/><br/>His body moved and he immediately flew towards the competition stage. The competition that belonged to the Hidden Dragon and young Phoenix Group had just ended.<br/><br/>The competition that was currently going on was the Heaven’s Pride Group.<br/><br/>Liao Feiyan and Liao Feiyu were currently at the competition stage!<br/><br/>The other party had hurt his mother on the stage.<br/><br/>Then, he had to return it!<br/><br/>“Looks like I have to return it soon! ”<br/><br/>In the room, Wang Xian’s gaze penetrated the wall as he looked at Tianci’s figure. He mumbled to himself!<br/><br/>This time, if Tianci was lucky, he might be able to hide for hundreds of thousands of years.<br/><br/>If he was unlucky, he would be exposed!<br/><br/>“So what if I’m exposed? I’m Here! ” Wang Xian smiled and stood up!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
