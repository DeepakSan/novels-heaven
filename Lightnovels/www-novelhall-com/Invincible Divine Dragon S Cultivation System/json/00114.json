At this moment, a figure flew towards the fourth level at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>“Oh?”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Junzi and the rest were slightly shocked. They immediately looked over.<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at the figure.<br/><br/>It was an expert from the same race as senior brother Lu, an expert at the peak of the Celestial Emperor Realm.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>However, the moment he dashed out, a terrifying pressure was emitted from the fourth level. Following that, Wang Xian and the rest felt that the entire fourth level was brightly lit, obscuring everyone’s vision.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this scene, his gaze focused and his dragon eyes stared ahead.<br/><br/>A white shadow appeared in his line of sight. The shadow was not clear and was twenty meters tall. It looked exactly the same as the Battle Angel.<br/><br/>This terrifying power was obviously a battle angel at the level of a universe knight.<br/><br/>Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. He did not expect that there would be a battle angel at the level of a universe knight in the fourth level.<br/><br/>The moment the old man entered the fourth level, the battle Angel began to move. Clearly, it was guarding the position of the fourth level.<br/><br/>As for the old man, he should be dead by now.<br/><br/>With the strength of a battle Angel at the venerable level, the old man didn’t even have the chance to scream.<br/><br/>“What… What happened here? Is it an array formation or some other protective object?”<br/><br/>Senior Sister Lingxin covered her eyes and felt the aura inside. She said in shock and couldn’t help but retreat.<br/><br/>The rest of the people also retreated hastily.<br/><br/>“I’ll go in first. If you guys want to go in, your lives are up to fate.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian felt the might of the battle angel of the venerable level. His heart was burning with passion. He couldn’t help but say something and flew straight into the fourth level.<br/><br/>The Battle Angel of the venerable level had the five elements grinding in it. It might be able to suppress it.<br/><br/>“Eh? Junior brother Wang Xian has gone in!”<br/><br/>The rest of the people immediately retreated. When they saw Wang Xian rushing in, their expressions changed slightly.<br/><br/>“Old Lu, should we go over?”<br/><br/>The old man beside senior brother Lu revealed an anxious expression. He could not help but ask.<br/><br/>Just now, it was their fellow clansmen who had rushed in. They did not know what was going on inside.<br/><br/>“Senior brother Lu, the power inside is too terrifying. Without the strength of junior brother Wang Xian, if we were to enter rashly, I’m afraid we would be in deep trouble!”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Junzi’s heart palpitated as he looked at the power coming from the fourth floor. His eyes flickered.<br/><br/>Senior brother Lu’s and the rest’s expressions changed. If the terrifying power from the fourth floor were to land on them, it would be able to kill them.<br/><br/>Moreover, if they were to enter, junior brother Wang Xian would definitely not help them.<br/><br/>It was a disaster!<br/><br/>“Elder Yue has entered. I’m afraid we are in some danger now.”<br/><br/>Senior brother Lu said with an ugly expression.<br/><br/>Senior Brother Kong, senior brother Xu, and the rest looked at senior brother Lu and shook their heads. “It’s too dangerous. There are battle angels on the third level that can kill us. If there is really danger on the fourth level, with our strength, we are no match for them.”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Kong and senior brother Xu now understood that the god country of a universe knight wasn’t a blessed land. To obtain some treasures, one had to have sufficient strength.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the treasures left behind by a knight in the god country could be fatal.<br/><br/>Especially for a universe great being like Crescent Moon Knight.<br/><br/>“Elder Yue is a little impulsive!”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Lu clenched his fists and his expression was a little ugly.<br/><br/>If something happened to elder Yue this time, not only would they not gain much this time, they would suffer a lot instead.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Holy Slash!”<br/><br/>At the same time, when Wang Xian had just charged in, an emotionless voice sounded beside his ear.<br/><br/>The Battle Angel at the level of a universe knight locked onto Wang Xian and attacked him.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>“Frost Sword!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements grinding mill met the battle angel at the level of a knight. A resplendent frost sword attacked the battle Angel directly.<br/><br/>His gaze swept past the corpse that was split in half and the incorporeal holy wings appeared on his back.<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>The Battle Angel at the venerable level held the holy sword tightly in both hands and slashed at the Frost Holy Sword.<br/><br/>A loud sound of collision was heard. Ice Sparks flew in all directions and the frost holy sword collapsed.<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved his body. His palm turned into a dragon claw and clawed at the Battle Angel.<br/><br/>His speed had been reduced by 90% . However, he was still slightly faster than the battle angel at the level of a universe knight.<br/><br/>“Bang, Bang, Bang!”<br/><br/>The Dragon Claw landed on the wings of the Battle Angel, producing the sound of metal colliding.<br/><br/>It left traces on the wings.<br/><br/>However, these traces were quickly healed by the powerful light energy.<br/><br/>“This won’t do. My attack power has been weakened. I Can’t break through the defense of this battle Angel. I still have to rely on the five elements grinding!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian frowned. Looking at the holy sword that was slashing towards him, he quickly dodged to the side.<br/><br/>The terrifying power of the holy sword came towards him horizontally and covered the entire four layers. Helpless, he immediately summoned the shapeless millstone and formed a shield in front of him.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>The holy sword slashed onto the shield. Wang Xian stood in the air above the five elements millstone. Waves of mighty power were channeled into the ground below.<br/><br/>At the center of the Five Elements Millstone, a dragon throne was formed. The five types of divine dragons in the five elements millstone extended their bodies and surrounded Wang Xian.<br/><br/>True control.<br/><br/>“Confine!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian slapped his palm on the dragon throne. Numerous thorns and blue streams of water flew towards the Battle Angel who was at the venerable level.<br/><br/>“Cleansing candle!”<br/><br/>The Battle Angel waved the holy sword in her hand. Beams of light shot towards the thorns and streams of water like laser beams.<br/><br/>“Bang! Bang! Bang!”<br/><br/>The sound of an explosion rang out as the thorns and water currents collapsed rapidly.<br/><br/>“Five elemental chains!”<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian focused his gaze. The five divine dragons around him let out a furious roar at the same time as they spat out energy of five different attributes.<br/><br/>The energy gathered together and formed a grayish chain. The chain went straight towards the Battle Angel.<br/><br/>“Holy Radiant Cross!”<br/><br/>The battle angel slashed horizontally and horizontally. A radiant cross that looked as though it was corporeal smashed towards the chain.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>The sound of a confrontation rang out. This time, the cross collapsed slowly.<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and channeled the energy from his body into the five elements grinding mill.<br/><br/>Waves of energy flowed into the five elements chain. The Phantom of the Divine Dragon on the chain revolved around it.<br/><br/>“Angel Cross.”<br/><br/>When the battle Angel saw the chains that were attacking him, his body trembled.<br/><br/>A battle angel formed from the condensation of attributes, and there was a cross behind him.<br/><br/>The Angel Cross directly attacked the five elemental chains.<br/><br/>“Bang Bang Bang!”<br/><br/>A violent collision sounded, and his gaze froze when he saw this scene.<br/><br/>“This is going to be troublesome. It might take some time to suppress it!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian frowned and mumbled.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
