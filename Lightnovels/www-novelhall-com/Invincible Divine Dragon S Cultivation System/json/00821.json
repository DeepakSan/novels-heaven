Boom! Boom<br/><br/>A terrifying astral beast that looked exactly the same emerged from the ruler of a level six astral beast and attacked Wang Xian.<br/><br/>This strange attack gave Wang Xian a slight shock.<br/><br/>However, from Wang Xian’s point of view, his strength was only slightly stronger.<br/><br/>The size of the astral beast was hundreds of times larger than Wang Xian when he was in his divine dragon form. The gigantic astral beast emitted a blood-red glow and charged towards Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>An extremely dull sound rang out. Wang Xian’s eyes focused as a sinister look appeared in his eyes.<br/><br/>Bang<br/><br/>A loud collision sound rang out. Wang Xian could feel that the blood-red energy was starting to explode.<br/><br/>Waves of corrosive energy charged towards his body.<br/><br/>Roar! Roar! Roar<br/><br/>However, in the next second, the space beast let out an intense scream.<br/><br/>His attacks were still unable to break through Wang Xian’s defense.<br/><br/>“Bang! Bang! Bang!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian fanned his dragon tail, which was covered with the power of the Taiji Dragon Disc. He swept it out forcefully.<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>A wave of light and dark energy surged, causing the dragon tail to enter the interior of the Space Beast’s body. Black and red blood flowed continuously.<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian extended his dragon claw. The powers of light and darkness gathered and clawed at the Space Beast’s body.<br/><br/>“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”<br/><br/>A large amount of flesh and blood was torn off.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>A miserable cry came from the Space Beast’s mouth.<br/><br/>There was a hint of fear in its blood-red eyes.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>It roared loudly and looked at the other six space beasts. It let out a cry for help.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>The other six space beasts, who were at level six, responded with a hint of fear in their eyes.<br/><br/>They could already sense that the other party’s strength was not something they could fight against.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>One by one, the Space Beasts roared. Their bodies began to retreat.<br/><br/>“Don’t let them escape!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shouted in a low voice. He swayed his dragon body and continued to attack the space beast.<br/><br/>Dragon Claws, Dragon Tail!<br/><br/>As they were all relying on the Tai Chi Dragon Plate, their attacks were very primitive.<br/><br/>Even so, with the tai chi dragon plate, each attack could leave a large number of wounds on its body.<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>The Space Beast let out a low roar. Streams of energy wrapped around its entire body and blocked Wang Xian’s attacks.<br/><br/>Now, it didn’t attack at all. It only defended.<br/><br/>The other six space beasts did the same. They retreated rapidly into the depths.<br/><br/>“Qingyue, kill one of them first!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian let out a low roar and said to Lan Qingyue.<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>Lan Qingyue responded immediately. She waved her arm and a gray spear appeared above her head instantly!<br/><br/>With a wave of her arm, the Gray Spear attacked the space beast in front of Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Woo Woo!”<br/><br/>“Woo Woo!”<br/><br/>Xiao Lan and Xiao House also growled. The gray ocean that was scattered around them started to revolve around the terrifying gray spear.<br/><br/>It was as if the entire ocean was carrying a spear as it attacked the space beast.<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>The space beast sensed the threat of death and couldn’t help but let out a wild roar.<br/><br/>The other six space beasts in front of him looked over and let out a low roar.<br/><br/>They wanted to save him, but it was already too late!<br/><br/>The terrifying attack landed on the Space Beast’s body.<br/><br/>The gray destruction spear penetrated his body directly. The terrifying gray ocean engulfed him directly.<br/><br/>Under the attacks of LAN Qingyue and the others, this space beast was instantly killed.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this, his face revealed a look of shock.<br/><br/>This was the ancient god Feeding Kun master.<br/><br/>This was the strength of the ancient god Feeding Kun master.<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>The other six space beasts who were at level six of the ruler realm saw it. Their blood-red eyes were filled with fury and killing intent.<br/><br/>They swayed their huge bodies and flew into the space rapidly.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest immediately chased after them from behind!<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>The six level six space beasts roared into the space.<br/><br/>Soon, they entered a special territory.<br/><br/>It was a very strange territory. There seemed to be a continent in front of them, but it was not a continent.<br/><br/>If one wanted to describe it, it could be described as a flesh and blood continent.<br/><br/>There was a black and red substance that looked like meat on it.<br/><br/>When this substance was connected, it was the size of more than ten universe planets.<br/><br/>The range wasn’t very big, but it wasn’t small either!<br/><br/>The special substance gave off a powerful energy. It had the power of Life and darkness.<br/><br/>The combination of life and darkness was very strange.<br/><br/>On this strange substance, there were some plants. These plants contained boundless energy!<br/><br/>The plants were very strange, like strange meatballs, black and red.<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>The six ruler level 6 space beasts flew over, letting out roars in unison!<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>Immediately, the ruler level 6 and below space beasts responded, letting out over a hundred roars.<br/><br/>Soon after, one space beast after another could be seen flying towards them.<br/><br/>The six void beasts opened their mouths.<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>One void beast after another entered their mouths as if they were merging into their bodies.<br/><br/>Their auras grew stronger and stronger.<br/><br/>Soon, over a hundred void beasts merged into their bodies.<br/><br/>Roar! Roar! Roar<br/><br/>In the next moment, a void beast at the sixth stage of the sovereign realm in the center raised its head and roared.<br/><br/>The two astral beasts on both sides immediately surged into its body.<br/><br/>“What Kind of Astral Beast is this? It can actually fuse?”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian and the rest who were flying over saw this scene, their expressions changed slightly. They were filled with shock.<br/><br/>“Stop them!”<br/><br/>He immediately let out a soft shout.<br/><br/>“Woo Woo Woo Woo!”<br/><br/>Xiao Zhai, Xiao Bai, and the rest immediately let out a roar. They opened their mouths and spat out grayish energy that condensed into two long spears.<br/><br/>Lan Qingyue waved her arm, and two gray chains appeared on her left and right hands.<br/><br/>The chains instantly wrapped around the two spears and quickly spread forward.<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>The space behemoth that was fusing sensed it and quickly flew forward.<br/><br/>As they flew, they fused together.<br/><br/>And as they fused, their speed increased greatly.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>Soon, the five sixth-stage sovereign realm space beasts completely entered the body of the Space Beast in the center.<br/><br/>Its aura became extremely terrifying.<br/><br/>However, it didn’t stop. Instead, it opened its mouth and began to devour the flesh and blood in front of it.<br/><br/>As the flesh and blood entered its stomach, its aura instantly became even more terrifying!<br/><br/>Its body size, also instantaneously doubled!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
