Even experts of the Great Dao level and even existences of the chaos level would not dare to act recklessly here.<br/><br/>Wang Xian, on the other hand, was looking for pets as though he was strolling in the back garden. No, he was looking for the gigantic beasts of chaos.<br/><br/>It was not as easy as he had imagined to enlighten the gigantic beasts of chaos.<br/><br/>This consumption was extremely huge for Wang Xian.<br/><br/>For example, the consumption of the power of chaos to enlighten the gigantic beast of chaos was close to a chaos level existence.<br/><br/>In other words, Wang Xian’s current strength had reduced by one chaos level.<br/><br/>However, even so, this was already considered a heaven-defying method.<br/><br/>He searched for another powerful gigantic beast of chaos.<br/><br/>This chaos behemoth species was only a dozen meters in size. Most importantly, it looked very pretty and cute.<br/><br/>After Wang Xian activated his spiritual intelligence in the future, he could definitely make it shrink in size again.<br/><br/>This way, he would have no problems being a pet!<br/><br/>There were a total of six dao-level beasts of this chaos behemoth species, and there were more than a dozen control-level beasts!<br/><br/>“Let’s go back!”<br/><br/>After preparing the gifts for his future child, Wang Xian returned to the Dragon Palace in satisfaction.<br/><br/>Next, he waited for the arrival of his child.<br/><br/>At this moment, the powerful disciples of the Dragon Palace were also preparing for the birth of their future Dragon Crown Prince and princesses!<br/><br/>They began to decorate the entire Dragon Palace in joy!<br/><br/>At the same time, the news that the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King was about to give birth to a group of crown princes and princesses quickly spread to the Dragon Palace Alliance and the Justice Alliance!<br/><br/>Once this news spread out, it was a huge matter for the entire Dragon Palace Alliance and the Justice Alliance.<br/><br/>Right now, the evil sequence faction had just been destroyed.<br/><br/>The news of the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King destroying all the powerful experts of the evil sequence faction by himself had already spread.<br/><br/>All the powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin realm were already aware of this.<br/><br/>Even the disciples of the Justice Alliance were aware of this matter.<br/><br/>Now, there was no killing or fighting in the entire area.<br/><br/>Even if it was during the calamity.<br/><br/>This chaotic realm was filled with peace.<br/><br/>No universe dared to start a war.<br/><br/>And no experts dared to.<br/><br/>Because they were afraid that the Dragon Palace would interfere.<br/><br/>This was also a great joyous event for many universe experts.<br/><br/>They didn’t need to worry about their safety during the calamity.<br/><br/>“The Dragon Child and dragon daughter have been born. This time, the Dragon Palace has notified the Justice Alliance. It can be considered as treating us as friends. Tell all experts to prepare, and all justice alliance experts to head to the Dragon Palace to celebrate the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>“Alliance Master, you don’t have to say it. The Dragon King has single-handedly destroyed the entire evil sequence camp. Naturally, we would like to meet the Invincible Dragon King.”<br/><br/>“I heard that the experts of the Dragon Palace Alliance will also bring their core disciples and children there. Alliance master, why don’t we bring them too? After all, the Justice Alliance will be lively with more people. Let Our Disciples go and broaden their horizons.”<br/><br/>“Sure, all the core disciples and children will go. It can also be considered as showing our respect!”<br/><br/>In the Justice Universe of the Justice Alliance, a large number of heaven origin creation realm experts had gathered here because of the Dragon Palace’s invitation.<br/><br/>They were discussing the matter of the Dragon King giving birth to a child.<br/><br/>Soon, this matter was also widely known in the Justice Alliance!<br/><br/>“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace gave birth to a child and invited our Justice Alliance. Now, Our Alliance leader has ordered all the experts to go together. This time, we’ll bring some disciples too. Hahaha, I’ve been chosen. I’m really looking forward to meeting the Invincible Dragon King!”<br/><br/>“The Dragon King single-handedly destroyed the evil sequence faction. It can be said that he has completely solved the chaotic situation in our region. In addition, this Dragon King is an existence above chaos, and his strength is invincible. I can also go with my grandfather this time!”<br/><br/>“WA, WA, WA, really? You can go to the nine-origin universe and participate in the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King’s Happy Event?”<br/><br/>“Hehe, this time, other than talented disciples and masters above level eight, only the juniors who are favored by the Heavenly Yuan creator are qualified to go. I’m looking forward to the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King’s wedding!”<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace’s Dragon King is still amazing. He invited the entire Justice Alliance when his children were born, and our Heavenly Yuan creator Masters fought to go. The Dragon King is really invincible. I want to go too!”<br/><br/>In the communication device of the Justice Union, everyone was discussing the joyous news regarding the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Some of the disciples who were able to follow the Dragon King were filled with self-satisfaction.<br/><br/>Ten Days Federation!<br/><br/>As the disciple of Wang Xian, Wu Tongming naturally received the invitation from the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>When Wu Tongming received the news, he immediately informed them about the existence of the primal chaos level in the supernatural realm.<br/><br/>Similarly, the powerhouses of the chaos level in the three-three universe also received the news very quickly!<br/><br/>Ever since Wang Xian killed the god of machinery who ascended to the universe, they were the main force in the entire ten-day federation.<br/><br/>Initially, from the perspective of the ten-day federation, Wu Tongming had an extremely powerful master. This was a very good thing for them.<br/><br/>It would allow them to have a powerful backer.<br/><br/>There was no need to worry about the Behemoth Alliance.<br/><br/>Therefore, the divine spring of the Presbyterian universe, an existence at the chaos level, also allowed Wang Xian to frequently move around and communicate with the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Therefore, Wu Tongming also had a good understanding of the situation in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>This was especially the case for the huge battle between the Dragon Palace Alliance and the evil sequence faction.<br/><br/>As the third disciple of the Dragon King, he naturally knew the truth of the matter.<br/><br/>In the evil sequence faction, four chaos-level existences and more than 400 heaven origin creator-level powerhouses had been destroyed by his master alone.<br/><br/>When his ancestor divine spring and the three gods of the three three universes found out, they were extremely shocked.<br/><br/>According to Wu Tongming’s information, the evil sequence faction’s strength was no weaker than the Behemoth Alliance.<br/><br/>But such a terrifying force had been destroyed by the Dragon King alone?<br/><br/>This was too terrifying!<br/><br/>Now, after knowing that the Dragon King was going to give birth to a child, the two of them immediately decided to lead the ten-day federation to celebrate!<br/><br/>Moreover, they wanted to make a grand celebration this time.<br/><br/>They wanted to prepare a powerful gift with enough sincerity.<br/><br/>They even wanted to lead all their core experts and disciples to go together.<br/><br/>The Dragon King’s happy event also caused quite a stir in the ten-day federation.<br/><br/>All the experts and disciples knew that the ten-day federation was going to celebrate the Dragon King.<br/><br/>They were no strangers to the Dragon King. After all, the robotic ascension universe of one of the three giants of the ten-day federation had been completely destroyed by the Dragon King!<br/><br/>The actions of the ten days federation naturally could not be hidden from the Giant Beast Alliance.<br/><br/>When the Giant Beast Alliance received this information, they also had some thoughts!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
