The Dragon King has personally admitted it!”<br/><br/>An angel frowned and said!<br/><br/>“So, our success rate of killing the Dragon King is only 50% ?”<br/><br/>An angel beside him had a serious expression. “How can a powerhouse who hasn’t reached the ruler realm be so terrifying? Is it because there are some powerhouses hiding by the Dragon King’s side that he was able to kill the Demon Breaker Circle?”<br/><br/>As the two angels spoke, their gazes fell on Gardecker’s Angel.<br/><br/>The Dragon King’s strength had once again exceeded their expectations!<br/><br/>Whether it was the Dragon King’s own terrifying strength or the existence of experts around him, it brought them great problems in killing the Dragon King!<br/><br/>“Let’s first meet up with the heaven extinguishing fire phoenix and see the situation on their side!”<br/><br/>Gardecker said thoughtfully!<br/><br/>Originally, they had an 80% chance of killing the Dragon King, but now, it was only 50% !<br/><br/>The strength of the Magic Breaker Circle was very terrifying!<br/><br/>“This is the only way. If the power of the fire vanishing sky is weaker, we can only ask the third prince for Help!”<br/><br/>Gardecker added!<br/><br/>“To kill a dragon king, he actually wasted so much energy. Killing a real ruler isn’t that troublesome!”<br/><br/>An angel couldn’t help but Exclaim!<br/><br/>The surrounding angels were in agreement!<br/><br/>They moved and continued flying forward. Ten minutes later, they came to the top of a meteorite. They scanned their surroundings and waited quietly for the situation with the Fire Phoenix!<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. Wang Xian was conducting his trade in the trading ground!<br/><br/>A large number of fruits were exchanged for resources. His harvest had reached an extremely huge level!<br/><br/>“Looks like I’ll have to stay here for a little longer this time!”<br/><br/>A month passed in the blink of an eye. Every day, there would be experts rushing over to buy the fruits!<br/><br/>In just a short month, he had sold more than a thousand fruits!<br/><br/>Fortunately, he had accumulated more fruits, reaching a few thousand!<br/><br/>Although he had sold fewer fruits in the past few days, his daily harvest was still very good!<br/><br/>Moreover, there was news on the universe’s AI that a group of experts would need more than a month to rush over!<br/><br/>More than a month was just a snap of the fingers. Wang Xian naturally had to wait for a while!<br/><br/>After selling all the fruits, Wu Sha and the rest should have eliminated the group of desolate beasts and the space behemoths!<br/><br/>At that time, Wang Xian was ready to leave the invincible zone!<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>However, at this moment, a message came from Wang Xian’s universal AI. When he saw this message, he raised his eyebrows slightly!<br/><br/>There were some problems with Wu Sha and the rest!<br/><br/>The problem was not that they had encountered a strong opponent, but that a group of space beasts had fled to a powerful and dilapidated divine kingdom!<br/><br/>With their strength, they were unable to break through the defense of this powerful divine kingdom!<br/><br/>This made them feel helpless!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this, he raised his eyebrows slightly!<br/><br/>The reason was that Wu Sha and the rest of the seven crazy demons, together with the Tai Chi Dragon Plate and the five elements millstone, had joined forces to hunt crazily in the territory of the space beasts. This alarmed the Space Beasts!<br/><br/>The group of space behemoths fled into the powerful and dilapidated divine kingdom in fear!<br/><br/>This left Wu Sha and the rest helpless!<br/><br/>“I really didn’t expect that Wu Sha and the rest would join forces and force the space behemoths to such an extent. It seems that the space behemoths are quite intelligent. They also know how to Dodge.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled!<br/><br/>In the past month, Wu Sha and the rest had hunted down a total of five space behemoths at the level of crazy demons!<br/><br/>Space Beasts usually acted alone. Under such circumstances, as long as Wu Sha and the rest rushed over, they would be able to kill the space beast in less than a minute!<br/><br/>During this process, the other space beasts felt a sense of danger and hid in a safe place!<br/><br/>“Come back first. In a few months, I will go with you guys!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian pondered for a moment and sent a message to them!<br/><br/>To kill the space beasts hiding in a divine kingdom, he needed an lie to take action!<br/><br/>A group of space beasts gathered in a divine kingdom might have already formed an alliance!<br/><br/>Therefore, Wang Xian didn’t ask an lie to go over and help them enter!<br/><br/>If something went wrong and he lost one or two of his mad demon subordinates, he would feel sorry for them!<br/><br/>These were the future powerhouses of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>Wu Sha and the rest quickly sent a message and rushed over to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>At the same time, beside the long river not far away from the trading venue!<br/><br/>More than a dozen powerhouses of the Angel clan were standing on a meteorite!<br/><br/>A terrifying aura swept over from the front of them!<br/><br/>Fire Phoenix, Water Phoenix, and Golden Phoenix flew over in large numbers. Each of them had a terrifying aura!<br/><br/>Amongst this group of Phoenixes, there were over a hundred other experts!<br/><br/>These over a hundred experts possessed a might that wasn’t weaker than the group of Phoenixes!<br/><br/>In the middle of the group of experts, there was an egg. This egg somewhat resembled a Phoenix Egg!<br/><br/>Terrifying Flames circulated on it, and from time to time, a pair of illusory wings spread its wings.<br/><br/>“They’re here!”<br/><br/>When the dozen or so angels saw the group of experts flying over, their eyes lit up!<br/><br/>“It’s been a month, and they’re finally here. There are over four hundred experts, and three of them have the combat strength of top-tier experts. are any of them at the Mad Demon Level?”<br/><br/>Gardecker’s angel stared ahead as he muttered!<br/><br/>“CHIRP CHIRP!”<br/><br/>At this moment, in the middle of the group of experts ahead, a fire Phoenix let out a cry as its gaze stared at the dozen or so angels!<br/><br/>“Fire Vanishing Heaven? We are under the orders of the third prince and are waiting for You Again!”<br/><br/>Gardecker looked at the Fire Phoenix and said!<br/><br/>“We are here to meet you on behalf of the Green River Water Phoenix!”<br/><br/>Fire Vanishing Heaven stared at them and said!<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>“Green River Water Phoenix?”<br/><br/>“Our third prince actually invited the experts of the Phoenix clan to help!”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
