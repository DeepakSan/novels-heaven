Is this for real? There are still pure-blooded divine dragons in this universe.”<br/><br/>The Milky Way’s black region was one of the Milky Way’s famous danger zones.<br/><br/>The sea water here was incomparably black, and it was almost completely dark inside.<br/><br/>Only god-emperor level experts were able to move around here.<br/><br/>The depths of the Milky Way’s bottom were pitch-black mud.<br/><br/>At this moment, in the center of the black region, the pitch-black milky way water was tinged with a hint of red.<br/><br/>A gush of bloody aura was gathered here.<br/><br/>Droplets of blood-red blood droplets could be seen in the surroundings.<br/><br/>A skeleton with no flesh or blood on its body and only bones floated in the center.<br/><br/>The skeleton’s body was emitting a golden light, looking extremely mystical.<br/><br/>In front of the skeleton was a ball of blood that was constantly squirming.<br/><br/>The blood condensed into the shape of a human, but it looked a bit terrifying.<br/><br/>“The venerable of our skeleton clan saw it with his own eyes. Would he lie to You? We saw one with our own eyes. It is said that there is more than one pure-blooded divine dragon in the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>“Once we can destroy the Dragon Palace, the strength of our two clans will be greatly improved. In the future, it shouldn’t be a problem for you to take revenge.”<br/><br/>The golden skeleton spoke in a metallic voice.<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace is not weak. Once we are exposed, the heavenly dragon clan might come after us.”<br/><br/>The figure condensed from blood spoke in a ghastly voice.<br/><br/>“Our skeleton clan working together with you can be considered to have offended the heavenly dragon clan. We are not afraid, so what do you have to be afraid of?”<br/><br/>“That Dragon Palace may be powerful, but over the years, your blood evil race has recovered a lot. Furthermore, I will call the nine blade race. Even though they only have one knight, he is still a level 2 knight.”<br/><br/>“They also have powerful family treasures. With our two races, it is enough. There are no level 3 knights in the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>The golden skeleton continued.<br/><br/>“Alright, we have ten Level 1 knights and four level 2 knights. This is almost all of our strength.”<br/><br/>“Distribute the spoils according to your strength.”<br/><br/>A voice came from the blood-condensed figure.<br/><br/>“Good, as expected of the blood-red race, they still have such powerful strength. Wait for our news here.”<br/><br/>As the golden skeleton spoke, its body slowly disappeared.<br/><br/>“Purebred divine dragons? If there really are purebred divine dragons and they devour their dragon blood, we will be able to make a breakthrough. At that time, it will be the time of death for the Heavenly Dragon Race.”<br/><br/>The figure condensed from the blood roared eerily, its eyes filled with hatred.<br/><br/>In the vast starry sky, many huge planets, warships, and islands were flying.<br/><br/>In the center, the leader of the nine swords race was cultivating with his eyes closed.<br/><br/>The nine swords race’s great escape this time, they still hadn’t thought of a place to stay.<br/><br/>Wandering in the boundless universe, everyone’s eyes were filled with confusion.<br/><br/>The universe was vast, but now there was no place for them to stay.<br/><br/>It was all because of that Dragon King.<br/><br/>Weng Weng<br/><br/>At this time, the nine swords clan leader who was sitting cross-legged in cultivation opened his eyes. A cold sword light flashed across his eyes.<br/><br/>He took out the universe AI and was slightly stunned when he saw the information on it.<br/><br/>He suddenly stood up and sent one message after another.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, hahaha!”<br/><br/>Soon, his face revealed a maniacal smile and his expression slowly became ferocious.<br/><br/>“I didn’t expect this. I really didn’t expect this. Dragon Palace, Dragon Palace, Hahaha!”<br/><br/>He couldn’t help but laugh maniacally.<br/><br/>“All the nine-sword race’s god Emperor and above experts, come over.”<br/><br/>A roar resounded in the ears of all the nine-sword race’s experts traveling in the universe.<br/><br/>They were slightly stunned and immediately flew over.<br/><br/>“Patriarch!”<br/><br/>Soon, more than 30,000 experts gathered in the main hall of the central planet and bowed to the nine-sword race’s patriarch.<br/><br/>“Everyone, follow me back to the Milky Way immediately!”<br/><br/>The nine swords clan leader’s face was full of joy as he ordered.<br/><br/>“What? Return to the Milky Way immediately?”<br/><br/>All the disciples were slightly stunned when they heard his words. Their faces were full of astonishment.<br/><br/>“Exterminate the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>The nine swords clan leader spat out three words.<br/><br/>“Exterminate the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>The disciples of the nine swords clan were slightly shocked once again.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. Follow me. The skeleton race will attack the Dragon Palace and they have found a powerful race. If the three races join hands, the Dragon Palace will be destroyed.”<br/><br/>The leader of the nine swords race said coldly.<br/><br/>“What? The skeleton race is going to attack the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>“The skeleton race is crazier than us nine swords in hunting the inferior dragon. I saw it on the computer just now. Someone said that the Dragon Palace has a pure-blooded divine dragon and there is a picture of it.”<br/><br/>“The skeleton clan wants to destroy the Dragon Palace, so they are obviously well prepared. That’s great. The Dragon Palace killed our venerable one and forced us to leave the Milky Way. This time, they will pay the price in blood.”<br/><br/>“Kill, destroy the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>When the disciples of the nine swords clan heard the news, they were extremely excited.<br/><br/>“Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>The leader of the nine swords race was in a good mood. With a wave of his arm, he led everyone towards the Milky Way.<br/><br/>Three hours later, a message about the nine swords race was spread in the Milky Way.<br/><br/>The message only had a few words: we nine swords are back!<br/><br/>When everyone saw this message, their faces were filled with shock.<br/><br/>“What’s going on? Why did the nine swords race make this announcement? Are they back?”<br/><br/>“The nine swords race is back? Back to the Milky Way? They dare to come back?”<br/><br/>“What happened? The nine swords race is going back to the Milky Way?”<br/><br/>Some people in the Milky Way started discussing when they saw this message.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace had exterminated the dragon race, so they would exterminate the nine swords race.<br/><br/>Why did the nine swords race return?<br/><br/>Did they negotiate with the Dragon Palace?<br/><br/>Did they reconcile?<br/><br/>Or what was the situation?<br/><br/>Everyone was filled with curiosity.<br/><br/>Even the primary races in the universe were slightly surprised and didn’t understand.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Dragon King, there is a message regarding the nine swords race on the AI. The nine swords race has announced that they are back.”<br/><br/>In the Dragon King Hall of the Dragon Palace, Prime Minister Gui reported a piece of information to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. “It’s a little strange.”<br/><br/>“It is a little strange.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui nodded.<br/><br/>In order to prevent the Dragon Palace from attacking them, the nine swords race had directly escaped. Now, they had returned in such a high-profile manner.<br/><br/>“Let’s ignore them for now. Ming ao Yao and the rest will head to the skeleton race to investigate the situation. After that, we will exterminate the skeleton race first.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not care too much about the nine-sword clan.<br/><br/>The Nine-sword clan only had one universe knight with level two combat strength. It was not enough to be relied on.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui nodded.<br/><br/>Wang Xian gently knocked on the Dragon Chair and flipped through the introduction of the skeleton clan by Crescent Moon Knight.<br/><br/>The skeleton clan did not belong to the human race. They were also a huge race in the universe.<br/><br/>As the name suggested, they were a skeleton.<br/><br/>The skeleton race, which focused on close combat, was very strong.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
