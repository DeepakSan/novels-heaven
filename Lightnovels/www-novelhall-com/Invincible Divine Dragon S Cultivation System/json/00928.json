In fact, they were slightly weak.<br/><br/>Once a spellcaster was engaged in close-range combat with a swordsman of the same level, there was a high chance that they would be killed.<br/><br/>On the other hand, a swordsman was more proficient in close-range combat while his long-range attacks were much weaker.<br/><br/>“The mages here are similar to the spell formation mages of the voodoo race.<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled. He took a glance at the old man and disappeared in an instant.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Not long after Wang Xian left, the old man slowly opened his eyes. There was a confused expression on his face.<br/><br/>Following that, his mind tightened and he quickly scanned his surroundings. There was a horrified expression on his face.<br/><br/>“Thank you for not killing me, senior. Thank you for not killing me!<br/><br/>The old man kept on saying.<br/><br/>“Let’s go to the Sacred Academy.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew out from here and had a goal in mind.<br/><br/>There was no cultivation method in the magical kingdom just now. The strongest spatial swordsman was only at the first level of the eternal swordmaster.<br/><br/>His strength was inferior to his!<br/><br/>According to the old man ‘s memory, he was flying in a direction rapidly!<br/><br/>His destination was the Ming Yi Saint Academy!<br/><br/>The Ming Yi Saint Academy was the closest and most powerful force to this place.<br/><br/>To be able to be called the Saint Academy, it had a terrifying overlord-level presence.<br/><br/>According to the old man ‘s memory, the Ming Yi Saint Academy was recruiting core students because it had just advanced to the Saint Academy.<br/><br/>That’s right, Wang Xian went to Ming Yi Saint Academy for the sake of learning!<br/><br/>If this news were to spread in the nine-origin universe, it would definitely cause a huge sensation.<br/><br/>But that was indeed the case!<br/><br/>Wang Xian had already cultivated the cultivation method of the nine-origin universe to the extreme. He had even evolved into the only nine-origin divine dragon and mastered nine attributes.<br/><br/>However, the cultivation method of space was the cultivation method of other universes.<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not understand it at all. He had to find a cultivation method.<br/><br/>Learning was the fastest way!<br/><br/>It was also a peaceful way.<br/><br/>Wang Xian had another method, which was to directly kill his way to a powerful holy ground ‘s sacred academy and collect cultivation methods related to the cultivation method of space.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian eventually gave up on such a high-profile behavior.<br/><br/>If he attracted a lot of attention, he might not be able to return to the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>It was better to keep a low profile when he was outside.<br/><br/>When he was able to fight against the fate of the Heaven’s origin, it wouldn’t be too late for him to keep a high profile!<br/><br/>With this thought in mind, Wang Xian quickly flew in a certain direction.<br/><br/>After flying for a year, he met many birds and creatures that belonged to this universe in the air.<br/><br/>There were creatures of all levels!<br/><br/>A year later, Wang Xian arrived at a magical city in the capital of the magical kingdom!<br/><br/>Wang Xian landed below and experienced this magical world. Then, he was teleported to another place through the spatial teleportation formation.<br/><br/>The spatial teleportation between the sword and the magical universe was more developed than the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>After all, the spatial attributes here were more concentrated.<br/><br/>Their teleportation array also led to various places!<br/><br/>After a month of continuous teleportation, Wang Xian arrived at the city of magic.<br/><br/>This was a city of magic in the sky!<br/><br/>The huge magic array and treasures supported the entire city.<br/><br/>This huge city was called the Ming Yi Saint Academy’s Elementary School. There were two schools in the Ming Yi Saint Academy. They were elementary<br/><br/>and advanced respectively_ The advanced school was not too far away from here!<br/><br/>This Ming Yi Saint Academy was an academy-like force. It had dozens of magical countries under its banner!<br/><br/>The elite disciples of magical countries fought to enter Ming Yi Saint Academy.<br/><br/>The entire academy taught magic and swordsmanship, which included the cultivation of the space attribute!<br/><br/>According to Wang Xian ‘s investigations on the way, there was a space expert who was at the level of a universe knight in Ming Yi Saint Academy.<br/><br/>This was also the reason why Wang Xian was certain about this place.<br/><br/>Although he could go to the more central and powerful forbidden grounds of the Saint Academy to study, this Ming Yi Saint Academy was not bad either!<br/><br/>Walking out from the teleportation formation, Wang Xian was dressed in a slightly luxurious outfit and held an ordinary sword in his hand.<br/><br/>He had two horns on his head and a towering horn on his head. He exuded an unparalleled aura.<br/><br/>The Aura on his body was only at the level of the fourth level of the Eternal Divine Lord. It wasn’t strong, but it was definitely not weak!<br/><br/>This was Wang Xian ‘s current attire. His main body was hidden in the Mother Nest and was silent!<br/><br/>He could be awakened at any time!<br/><br/>After looking for the route, Wang Xian walked towards the registration area of the Ming Yi Saint Academy.<br/><br/>The Ming Yi Saint Academy was a faction that had just advanced to the Saint Academy not too long ago. Currently, they were recruiting disciples.<br/><br/>As long as one possessed potential and strength, they could come straight to the Saint Academy to take the assessment!<br/><br/>After passing the assessment, one could join the Saint Academy directly.<br/><br/>There was no fixed time for the assessment. As long as one met the conditions, one could enter Mingyi saint academy at any time!<br/><br/>Wang Xian arrived at the assessment site of Mingyi Saint Academy through a few short-distance teleportation arrays!<br/><br/>The entrance of the Mingyi Saint Academy was also located at the entrance!<br/><br/>The entrance of the entire Mingyi Saint Academy looked extremely magnificent.<br/><br/>This was a city that was suspended in the air, and the Mingyi Saint Academy belonged to the air of a city in the sky!<br/><br/>At a glance, one would need to walk thousands of steps to reach the entrance!<br/><br/>At the front of the steps, there were two words, “Assessment”!<br/><br/>As long as one injected energy, there would be people coming for the assessment!<br/><br/>“This Ming Yi Saint Academy is much grander and more magnificent than the high-level races in the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>Wang Xian sized up his surroundings as his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>There was a huge difference between the sword and Magic Universe and the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>That was, the powerful forces in the sword and Magic Universe did not belong to the race.<br/><br/>Unlike the nine-origin universe, which was divided into the Divine Dragon Clan, the Black Tortoise clan, the skeleton clan, and so on!<br/><br/>Most of the people here were humans, and their physiques were all the same!<br/><br/>The sacred grounds and sacred grounds here were comparable to the peak races of the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>But in reality, their strength might be much weaker than the peak races of the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>Because there were many sacred grounds and sacred grounds here, there might be tens of thousands of powers in the entire sword and Magic Universe!<br/><br/>This was because the experts here were very scattered.<br/><br/>This also meant that many of the powerful cultivation techniques here were widely spread!<br/><br/>They didn’t place too much importance on bloodlines and constitutions!<br/><br/>This also made it so that people born in ordinary families had the chance to step into the peak.<br/><br/>As for the 9-origin universe, it was much harder!<br/><br/>If they didn’t break through the starry universe, it would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens for the experts of the high-level races to step into the ruler realm!<br/><br/>The wide spread of the practice of law enforcement had also created an ordinary force. It was also possible for them to give birth to a dominant expert and slowly advance into a Holy Land!<br/><br/>To Wang Xian, the environment for him to study was very good!<br/><br/>His gaze landed on the word ‘study’. Wang Xian used the spatial energy in his body and directly blasted it upwards!<br/><br/>He used his energy to completely blast into the interior of the word!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
