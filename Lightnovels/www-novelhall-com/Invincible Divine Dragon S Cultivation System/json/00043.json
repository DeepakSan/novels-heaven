Go<br/><br/>“It’s a total war!”<br/><br/>“This is the Red Mist clan’s founding day of Celestial Emperor Hong Tian. A battle has actually erupted.”<br/><br/>“Perhaps even celestial emperor Hong Tian did not expect such a situation. He did not expect the Dragon Palace to actually be Ming Xuanzhi’s benefactor. He also did not expect the Dragon Palace to actually let Ming Xuanzhi attack directly.”<br/><br/>“Quick, quick, this is a battle between peak-stage Celestial Emperor Magi. Let’s immediately hide far away!”<br/><br/>When the battle erupted, the various races immediately retreated to the rear.<br/><br/>A peak-stage divine Emperor Magus, this battle was enough to destroy the world.<br/><br/>“Ahhhhh!”<br/><br/>As their races and races retreated, screams came from the rear.<br/><br/>The demonic fiend that had turned into a poisonous horned dragon, its entire body pitch-black like black liquid, had already started slaughtering the red fog race disciples.<br/><br/>Those who occupied the two rows at the back were all red fog clan’s disciples below the divine emperor level.<br/><br/>Originally, the Red Fog clan had used it to display their foundations and had arranged all the disciples into two rows to act as a show.<br/><br/>In the end, they were attacked by the demonic fiend at the first instance.<br/><br/>The divine emperor level eight had slaughtered disciples below the divine emperor level, and it was under a sudden attack.<br/><br/>The group of disciples did not even have the time to react. In an instant, they swept across and killed tens of thousands of red fog clan’s disciples.<br/><br/>Not a single one was left alive!<br/><br/>All of them were the grand-disciples of God Emperor Hong Tian, the future elites and core disciples of the red fog race.<br/><br/>The red fog race had just been established and did not have much population to begin with. All of the elite core disciples were his disciples’disciples.<br/><br/>Now, 80% of them had been wiped out.<br/><br/>“Bastard, you’re courting death!”<br/><br/>In front of them, when the red fog race’s god Emperors saw mo sha slaughtering their disciples, their eyes revealed a blood-red color as they instantly attacked Mo Sha.<br/><br/>“Jie Jie Jie, kill!”<br/><br/>Ba Qi let out a strange cry. His body moved and locked onto the god Emperors in front of him as he charged forward.<br/><br/>His target was those experts below the god Emperor Rank 8.<br/><br/>“Stop him!”<br/><br/>“Everyone, take action and trap them!”<br/><br/>The red fog race’s three God Emperor Rank 9 magi, as well as the god Emperor Rank 9 explosive mountain giant, had a huge change in expression. They immediately roared loudly.<br/><br/>The power of the formation gathered in the void and a terrifying power was formed instantly.<br/><br/>“Die!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw them setting up the formation, a cold expression appeared in his eyes. He pushed his speed to the limit.<br/><br/>“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”<br/><br/>In an instant, the hundreds of celestial thearchs of the red fog race on the left were instantly killed.<br/><br/>“Old Man Ming, die! Do you really think that I, Hong Tian, am still the same Hong Tian from tens of millions of years ago?”<br/><br/>In the sky, God Emperor Hong Tian heard the screams from below. When he saw the disciples of the red fog race being killed, his heart sank and he shouted sternly.<br/><br/>“Origin magnetic light ring, calamity of bloody light!”<br/><br/>He waved his arm and waves of energy poured into the origin magnetic light ring above his head. Red beams of light shot towards Ming Xuanzhi.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, I was able to suppress you back then, and I’m doing the same now!”<br/><br/>Ming Xuanzhi laughed out loud. His body moved and flew directly towards the group of experts from the red fog race. His body was enveloped by a black shadow.<br/><br/>As he flew, he quickly waved his arm and set up numerous formations.<br/><br/>“Taste the Dark Sky King’s shadow of our Tianming Race!”<br/><br/>Ming Xuanzhi roared loudly. Very soon, an incomparably huge black shadow appeared in front of him. His figure directly attacked the red pillar.<br/><br/>“Damn it, all the experts of the red fog race have retreated from our battlefield!”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian’s expression was extremely unsightly when he saw Ming xuanzhi surrounding his subordinates.<br/><br/>His subordinates were all around him, and this made him unable to let go.<br/><br/>However, Ming Xuanzhi did not have any scruples. He waved his energy, and a few of the weaker disciples around him were directly affected, instantly dying.<br/><br/>“Quick, quick, Quick!”<br/><br/>The red fog race’s powerhouses fled in fear.<br/><br/>Among them, a few rank 9 celestial thearch-level powerhouses of the red fog race were also horrified. They quickly dodged to the side.<br/><br/>They were far away from the battlefield between celestial thearch-level Hong Tian and Ming Xuanzhi.<br/><br/>“Die!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw the chaos in the red fog race, he narrowed his eyes slightly. His eyes were filled with killing intent.<br/><br/>“Whoosh!”<br/><br/>He pushed his speed to the maximum and locked his gaze on the few rank 8 celestial thearch Magi of the red fog race.<br/><br/>“Not good. The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is attacking us. Attack him!”<br/><br/>“Defend and Dodge!”<br/><br/>The expressions of the few rank 8 celestial thearch Magi of the red fog race changed drastically. They immediately roared loudly.<br/><br/>“Die!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian didn’t even need to use his supernatural ability to kill a rank 8 celestial thearch.<br/><br/>His arm suddenly transformed into a terrifying dragon claw. The Dragon Claw that was a few thousand meters long swept out and grabbed the three level eight celestial thearch powerhouses in his hand.<br/><br/>“Bang, Bang, Bang!”<br/><br/>The destructive force immediately caused the life force of the three level eight celestial thearch powerhouses to disappear.<br/><br/>“Surround and attack him!”<br/><br/>“All level nine celestial thearch powerhouses surround and attack him!”<br/><br/>When the four level nine celestial thearch powerhouses of the Red Fog clan saw this, their expressions changed drastically. They immediately roared loudly.<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian did not fight them head-on. He flapped his wings and flew to the side to hunt down the weaker celestial thearch powerhouses around him.<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>“Not good. First Elder, save us!”<br/><br/>The Wizards who were getting close to them did not have the strength to resist at all. They roared with fear on their faces.<br/><br/>A few of them flashed and wanted to escape immediately.<br/><br/>“Dragon Eyes Lock on all corners!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s dragon eyes flashed with a luster. Strands of chains appeared in front of them in an instant.<br/><br/>Their illusory bodies were pulled out instantly and the chains penetrated through them.<br/><br/>“No!”<br/><br/>A terrified voice came from their mouths.<br/><br/>“Kill him, kill him!”<br/><br/>When the four divine emperors of the red fog race saw this scene, their faces were gloomy as they roared furiously.<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>Wang Xian didn’t hesitate at all. He relied on his powerful speed to fly straight towards the first test and locked onto a group of people.<br/><br/>“Run, run, run!”<br/><br/>“It’s this demon, it’s this demon!”<br/><br/>The expressions of the three-eyed race members who were locked onto changed drastically. The three-eyed race leader’s heart was trembling violently as he shouted in fear.<br/><br/>Previously, this fellow had killed all the elite powerhouses of the two races. Now, they were actually being hunted by this demon again.<br/><br/>This made the three-eyed tribe leader feel suffocated and hopeless.<br/><br/>They had already joined the Red Mist tribe and a wizard at the peak of the celestial thearch level.<br/><br/>“A bunch of people who are seeking death. Die!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with killing intent when he saw the three-eyed tribe. He swiped his dragon claw at them.<br/><br/>“Bang, Bang, Bang!”<br/><br/>The Dragon Claw that was filled with destructive power swept past. The five to six hundred celestial thearchs of the three-eyed tribe were instantly covered.<br/><br/>“No! Don’t kill me!”<br/><br/>A desperate voice rang out, but it quickly came to an abrupt end.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a giant whose body was at least a thousand meters long and whose entire body was like a giant rock let out a roar and charged toward Wang Xian.<br/><br/>The Explosive Mountain Giant!<br/><br/>“HMPH!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian snorted coldly. When he saw the huge explosive mountain giant, he flapped his wings and easily evaded his attack. Then, he flew toward the first test again.<br/><br/>Those were the war pets of the Red Mist tribe.<br/><br/>If he couldn’t kill anyone, he would kill his war pets!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
