With everyone’s help, it will be very easy for us to unify the Holy Dragon Clan!”<br/><br/>The Holy Dragon King nodded heavily when he heard the words of the clan leader of the god Herder clan.<br/><br/>With the help of the six great clans, the Holy Dragon King felt that unifying the Holy Dragon clan would be very easy.<br/><br/>This was equivalent to the power of seven Holy Dragon’s lineages!<br/><br/>Of course, it couldn’t reach the power of Seven Sacred Dragons.<br/><br/>Because not long ago, the battle between the sacred dragons and the ancestral dragons received the support of the third prince!<br/><br/>He was given a few connate true treasures!<br/><br/>But even so, with the help of the six races, it was easy for him to destroy the ancestral dragons at their peak!<br/><br/>Unifying the dragon race was easy too.<br/><br/>Because of their combined power, the number of universe masters with level-three Battle Power had exceeded 100!<br/><br/>“Then let’s complete the third Prince’s order as soon as possible!”<br/><br/>The leader of the light giant said indifferently!<br/><br/>“Okay, our Holy Dragon bloodline will issue a statement in a while to make the ancestral dragon bloodline and the Dragon Palace submit. If they don’t submit, we’ll use the Dragon Palace to make an example of them!”<br/><br/>The Sacred Dragon King said!<br/><br/>The six clan leaders nodded!<br/><br/>After a simple discussion, they left!<br/><br/>They didn’t care too much about helping the sacred dragon clan unify the Divine Dragon Clan!<br/><br/>Their combined strength was enough to sweep through everything!<br/><br/>Dragon Palace?<br/><br/>Easily destroyed!<br/><br/>After the Sacred Dragon King sent the six clan leaders away, he smiled and his expression slowly darkened.<br/><br/>“Dragon Palace, Dragon King, this time, I want to put your dragon head together with the ancestral Dragon King’s!”<br/><br/>He growled with a face full of killing intent!<br/><br/>“Weng!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the light ball on his body flew out and the third Prince’s figure appeared!<br/><br/>“Greetings, Master!”<br/><br/>He hurriedly knelt on the ground and bowed respectfully!<br/><br/>“These are some treasures that this prince obtained with great difficulty. Don’t disappoint me and quickly advance to the universe ruler realm!”<br/><br/>With a wave of the third Prince’s arm, drops of dazzling treasures appeared in front of him.<br/><br/>“Thank you, master. Thank you, master. I will definitely not disappoint you!”<br/><br/>The Holy Dragon King felt the energy contained in these treasures. His body trembled as he kowtowed in excitement!<br/><br/>The third prince did not respond and slowly disappeared!<br/><br/>“Hahaha, hahaha, with these treasures, I have a very high chance of breaking through to the level of a universe overlord. hahaha!”<br/><br/>An excited voice reverberated in the Hall!<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Time continued to pass. Wang Xian sat in the Dragon Palace and looked through the information one by one!<br/><br/>The information regarding the holy dragon lineage and the range of their activities!<br/><br/>“Let’s go and take a look around the holy dragon lineage!”<br/><br/>After Wang Xian finished looking through all the information, he stood up with a smile on his face!<br/><br/>“Prime Minister Gui, you take care of the Dragon Palace. I’m going out for a while!”<br/><br/>He said to Prime Minister Gui before disappearing quickly!<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui replied immediately!<br/><br/>“It will take more than a year to reach the lineage of the Holy Dragon from here. However, I should be able to move faster!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew out from the Dragon Palace and mumbled to himself!<br/><br/>The incipient Saint Wings appeared on his back. He flew in a direction at a terrifying speed!<br/><br/>With his full speed, he was comparable to a Master of the universe!<br/><br/>A few days later, he arrived at a city and traveled through a teleportation formation!<br/><br/>Without a teleportation formation, it would take Wang Xian more than a thousand years to reach the Holy Dragon lineage from the River Styx!<br/><br/>The interior of the heaven-opening primal continent was simply too huge!<br/><br/>Without these cities and the open races to connect the teleportation formation, it would take a very, very long time to go from one place to another!<br/><br/>While Wang Xian was rushing towards the Holy Dragon lineage, the Holy Dragon lineage was also making arrangements!<br/><br/>After the Holy Dragon King obtained the treasure, he immediately absorbed it.<br/><br/>However, it was not that easy to break through to the realm of the ruler of the universe!<br/><br/>When he stored all the resources in his body, a year had already passed!<br/><br/>“It’s better to unify the Divine Dragon tribe first. I don’t want to waste too much time on the six great races!”<br/><br/>The Holy Dragon King opened his eyes and looked at the messages on the universe’s AI. He mumbled to himself!<br/><br/>“This time, I will personally go out and take the head of the Dragon Palace Dragon King!”<br/><br/>He continued muttering and edited a piece of information on the Universe AI.<br/><br/>Because the third prince wanted him to unify the Divine Dragon clan and leave those powerful pure-blooded divine dragons behind, he had to make a statement in advance!<br/><br/>This statement was to make the ancestral dragon clan and the Dragon Palace submit directly and avoid too many battles!<br/><br/>He felt that this statement was enough to intimidate the Dragon Palace and the ancestral Dragon Clan!<br/><br/>After he finished editing the information, he immediately contacted the six great clans!<br/><br/>Then, he began to wait for the news quietly!<br/><br/>Soon, the statement about the Holy Dragon King of the Holy Dragon Clan began to sweep through the entire heaven opening desolate continent at a terrifying speed!<br/><br/>Holy Dragon King: Today, the Holy Dragon bloodline has issued a statement. The Sky Plant Demonic Beast Race, the Ghoul race, the god Herder race, the light giant race, the light sound bug race, and the Black Fog Spirit race are the six great races, they will do their best to help the Holy Dragon bloodline unify the Holy Dragon Race. Anyone who resists will be killed without mercy. Anyone with the Holy Dragon bloodline who joins my race can become a disciple of the Holy Dragon Bloodline!<br/><br/>This statement quickly spread across the universe’s AI!<br/><br/>When everyone saw this information, they were slightly stunned!<br/><br/>They pursed their lips, their eyes shining!<br/><br/>This statement was extremely shocking!<br/><br/>However, the information revealed in this statement was even more shocking!<br/><br/>Everyone knew that the Sky Plant Demon Beast Race, Ghoul race, god Herder race, light giant race, light sound bug race, and black fog spirit race were the six great races. They were with the angel race!<br/><br/>They were the subsidiary races of the Angel Race!<br/><br/>The six great races were helping the Holy Dragon race unify the Holy Dragon Race. It was definitely not because the holy dragon race had great prestige and invited them to help unify the Holy Dragon Race!<br/><br/>The Holy Dragon race did not have such prestige. Even if they were invited with treasures and resources, they could not be invited!<br/><br/>It was very obvious that the six great races had received other orders!<br/><br/>And this order obviously came from the Angel clan!<br/><br/>In other words, the Angel clan allowed the Sacred Dragon clan to unify the Divine Dragon Clan!<br/><br/>This… came from the will of the peak clans!<br/><br/>Who could resist it?<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace?<br/><br/>The Ancestral Dragon Clan?<br/><br/>It was obviously impossible!<br/><br/>“This… The Sky Plant Demon Beast Clan, the corpse-eating ghost clan, the god Shepherd clan, the light giant clan, the light sound bug clan, and the Black Fog Spirit clan helped the Sacred Dragon clan unify the Divine Dragon Clan. How could the Dragon Palace and the ancestral Dragon Clan resist it?”<br/><br/>“Is this the will of the peak races? The Dragon Palace and the ancestral dragon clan are completely finished. The six great races, these are the six great races!”<br/><br/>“Hiss, I really didn’t expect that the Holy Dragon King had persuaded the Angel clan, and it was arranged by the Angel clan. But no matter what, the Divine Dragon Clan will be unified by the Holy Dragon Clan!”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
