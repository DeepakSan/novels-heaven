Even the flustered flowing blue and the Heaven’s origin creation in the unfettered forbidden ground were even more flustered at this moment!<br/><br/>Especially when they heard what Lin Niu said!<br/><br/>Their eyes were wide open and filled with disbelief and shock!<br/><br/>In the sword and magic universe, if an expert at the Heavenly Yuan creation level was born, it would be a blessing for their entire universe!<br/><br/>It would be the great luck of their entire universe!<br/><br/>But now, in the ninth level of the Demonic Beast Abyss, there was actually a creature that had broken through to the Heavenly Yuan creation level!<br/><br/>Especially after hearing what Lin Niu said about the Agar Heavenly Demon God!<br/><br/>Their expressions were extremely flustered!<br/><br/>In the last calamity battle, it was the Asgard Heavenly Demon God who led his army and invaded their sword and Magic Universe!<br/><br/>A race in the Void Universe also took the opportunity to fish in troubled waters!<br/><br/>At that time, their sword and Magic Universe only had one heaven origin creation level expert.<br/><br/>That expert was an elder from the unfettered forbidden land.<br/><br/>At that time, he could only defend against the Asgard Heavenly Demon God alone!<br/><br/>He could not care about the other invasions at all!<br/><br/>This caused their army to invade the center of the Sword and Magic Universe.<br/><br/>This caused the entire sword and magic universe to suffer terrible losses!<br/><br/>Later, Liu Lan’s breakthrough eased the crisis of the sword and Magic Universe!<br/><br/>Only then did they drive Asgard away!<br/><br/>But in that battle, although they had cut off Asgard’s limbs, they had suffered different degrees of damage during the battle!<br/><br/>This was especially so for Liu Lan. After the end of the calamity, it took her more than 10 billion years to completely recover from her injuries!<br/><br/>Experts who were also at the Heavenly Yuan creation realm were extremely terrifying when they fought!<br/><br/>This was especially so for Asgard, who was a veteran of the Heavenly Yuan creation realm.<br/><br/>Even when Liu Lan broke through and joined forces with the unfettered forbidden ground’s heavenly yuan creation realm, they were still unable to completely kill him!<br/><br/>That battle was filled with Carnage!<br/><br/>That battle was filled with countless deaths and injuries!<br/><br/>Only a few tens of millions of sword and magic universe beings remained.<br/><br/>One had to know that there were trillions of life forms in a single universe!<br/><br/>This was the terror of the Battle of the Apocalypse.<br/><br/>This was the calamity that Asgard brought to their universe!<br/><br/>Now, they could not understand why Asgard would appear in their sword and Magic Universe!<br/><br/>Why would the Asgard Celestial Demon God break through to the Heaven’s origin creation realm!<br/><br/>What was going on!<br/><br/>“Asgard Celestial Demon God, you said he is the Asgard Celestial Demon God.<br/><br/>How are you sure that the one who broke through is the Asgard Celestial<br/><br/>Demon God?”<br/><br/>Liu Lan’s body trembled as she looked at Wang Xian. She could not help but ask!<br/><br/>“That’s because the Lin Niu was born from the limbs of the Asgard Celestial Demon God. That’s because I met him not long ago!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at her and replied indifferently!<br/><br/>“Boss, that Asgard Celestial Demon didn’t devour me before he broke through.<br/><br/>This… ”<br/><br/>Lin Niu’s expression was a little ugly as well. Once the Asgard Celestial Demon broke through, he would be unable to step into the Heaven’s origin realm in the future!<br/><br/>That was because the path ahead of him was blocked!<br/><br/>If the Asgard Celestial Demon didn’t die, he wouldn’t be able to break through!<br/><br/>“There’s no other way! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head and looked at Liu Lan and the Heaven’s origin creation in the unfettered forbidden land, he said coldly, “This is going to be interesting. If you guys can’t negotiate with the Asgard Celestial Demon God, I’m afraid that at least half of the living beings in the sword and Magic Universe will die. Hehe!”<br/><br/>He laughed coldly as his thoughts spun.<br/><br/>His gaze swept across the great elder and the rest of the people in the flowing water forbidden ground. He continued to speak indifferently, “When the time comes, the agar heavenly demon god might not be the only one to make a<br/><br/>When Liu Lan and the Heaven ‘s origin creator from the unfettered forbidden ground heard Wang Xian’s words, their expressions changed drastically.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, Liu Lan, hopeless heaven, I can sense your auras. Old friends, Hahaha, old friends, I can sense your auras! ”<br/><br/>“In the last calamity battle, if it wasn’t for you guys, I wouldn’t have fallen. However, fortunately, I’ve made some arrangements. Hahaha, this time, I want your swords and the magic universe to be a river of blood! ”<br/><br/>At this moment, at the ninth level of the Demon Beast Abyss, that violent and cruel voice continued to ring out!<br/><br/>Following that, a terrifying figure flew out from below!<br/><br/>The figure was filled with blood-red wings!<br/><br/>His entire body was filled with sharp thorns!<br/><br/>On his head, there were more than ten blood-red eyes growing out!<br/><br/>Each eye was half a meter in size!<br/><br/>And what was terrifying was that within these eyes, there was a ferocious face!<br/><br/>He looked like a terrifying demon that came from the Abyss!<br/><br/>He came out from the ninth level of the abyss of Magic Beasts, and his blood-red eyes stared at Liu Lan and the Unfettered Heaven’s origin creation expert, Hopeless Heaven!<br/><br/>Every face in those eyes was filled with a ferocious and excited expression! He had returned!<br/><br/>If it wasn’t for the injuries left behind from the previous calamity, he wouldn’t have died!<br/><br/>He wanted to make the sword and Magic Universe pay a terrible price! He wanted to make the sword and magic universe bleed like a river!<br/><br/>“Agar Tian, it’s really you! ”<br/><br/>Hopelessly Heaven saw the Agar Heavenly Demon God who flew out. When he saw his figure, his body trembled as he roared with blood-red eyes!<br/><br/>Agar Heavenly Demon God!<br/><br/>It was him!<br/><br/>In the last calamity, the Agar Heavenly Demon God who killed countless lives in their sword and Magic Universe!<br/><br/>Liu Lan, who was at the side, stared at him. His expression changed drastically!<br/><br/>On their side, the matter of Wang Xian had yet to be resolved!<br/><br/>In the end!<br/><br/>In the end, another Agar Heavenly Demon God appeared out of nowhere, a mortal enemy!<br/><br/>Could it be that the heavens wanted to destroy their sword and Magic Universe!<br/><br/>“Hehehe, Liu Lan, hopeless heaven. Did you not expect this? Hahaha, over the past few hundred million years, I have allowed countless magical beasts to train with you all in order to buy time for me to break through! ”<br/><br/>“Hehehe, I still succeeded. You guys are still as stupid as ever! ”<br/><br/>Asgard said as he extended his blood-red tongue, which was a few hundred meters long, and licked the bone spikes on his arm!<br/><br/>His eyes turned even more blood-red! “It’s been a long, long time since I drank blood! ”<br/><br/>As he spoke, he flapped his wings slightly!<br/><br/>He was like a terrifying devil that could destroy the world!<br/><br/>When Liu Lan and Wang Wangtian heard his words, their expressions changed drastically.<br/><br/>“In the flowing water forbidden land, all those who broke the rules participated in the killing of Long Yinhao. All those who were involved in this incident committed suicide to atone for their crimes! ”<br/><br/>Liu Lan turned his head and looked at all the strong disciples in the flowing water forbidden land with a cold expression. His voice was filled with killing intent!<br/><br/>The hatred between Wang Xian and them wasn ‘t that great.<br/><br/>It could even be said that they could completely resolve it!<br/><br/>The reason why she didn’t agree earlier was because Wang Xian was too domineering.<br/><br/>She had come to their sword and magic universe to interfere in their matters and even asked the strong ones who killed them to do so. Naturally, she couldn’t agree so easily!<br/><br/>But now, she had no other choice!<br/><br/>Now, it was no longer about crippling the master of flowing water forbidden land and the great elder, but killing them directly!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
