Suddenly, he opened his eyes and revealed an embarrassed expression.<br/><br/>“Oh?”<br/><br/>The old woman looked at him and frowned slightly.<br/><br/>“The people from the Black Codex Treasured Land are dead again!”<br/><br/>The middle-aged gods said with a gloomy face.<br/><br/>He picked up a faith communication stone plate and immediately sent a message.<br/><br/>“Dead again?”<br/><br/>The old woman frowned slightly.<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, the other gods of the 24 palaces also received the news, their eyes shining.<br/><br/>“Before they died, they didn’t sense that some space beast killed them. It seems that the strength of that space beast is at least at the level of a ruler at level six, or maybe even at level seven or eight.”<br/><br/>Not far away, a group of gods who believed in the universe spoke up!<br/><br/>“Pass the message down. Temporarily declare the Black Codex Treasure land a forbidden area and don’t Go There!”<br/><br/>The middle-aged gods said helplessly.<br/><br/>More than 40 level 7 gods had been killed there in succession. The space of the Black Codex Treasure land was no longer something they could deal with!<br/><br/>Now, they could only give it up and make it a forbidden land!<br/><br/>Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to bear any more losses!<br/><br/>“The Starry Universe, after all, is still the domain of the Space Beasts!”<br/><br/>One of the gods sighed. With their strength, they didn’t dare to enter the starry universe.<br/><br/>Because the space beasts would chase after them.<br/><br/>At that time, a space beast that controlled level eight and level nine would be able to kill them.<br/><br/>If they didn’t have a life-saving true treasure, they wouldn’t be able to escape!<br/><br/>Therefore, there might be a terrifying space beast in the Black Scripture treasured land, and they couldn’t do anything about it.<br/><br/>They could only make that place a forbidden area, so that the gods wouldn’t go there.<br/><br/>“This time, our heavenly palace suffered quite a heavy loss. Fortunately, we were completely at an advantage in the war with the nine-origin universe. We managed to recruit many believers who came to save the Universe!”<br/><br/>The old woman spoke to the middle-aged man as a faint smile appeared on her face.<br/><br/>The middle-aged man nodded his head.<br/><br/>Good news kept coming from their war with the nine-origin Universe!<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“They’re not coming?”<br/><br/>For the next ten years, Wang Xian had been hiding in the sky above the black scripture treasured land.<br/><br/>More than ten years had passed, and the Gods of faith had never come again.<br/><br/>This made him smile.<br/><br/>Just as he had predicted, the successive losses made them afraid to send more powerhouses over.<br/><br/>“They should be really afraid. In that case, they can leave now. There has been a lot of news from the northern frost eight Qi.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled.<br/><br/>Recently, although he had been staying here, the eight-headed demon and the others had been searching for the gods who believed in the universe.<br/><br/>Moreover, once they found them, with the five elements millstone, they could kill them instantly!<br/><br/>During this period of time, using the five elements millstone, the eight-headed demon and the others had also killed thousands of gods who believed in the universe.<br/><br/>“Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed the location of the great mill of five elements. With a move of his body, he immediately flew towards the great mill of five elements.<br/><br/>A year later, Wang Xian met up with the Northern Frost Demonic Fiend, eight-limbed demonic fiend, and the rest!<br/><br/>“Master!”<br/><br/>“Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The Northern Frost eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest shouted at Wang Xian excitedly!<br/><br/>Recently, their gains were extremely huge!<br/><br/>With so many resources, it wouldn’t be long before they achieved a breakthrough!<br/><br/>“Bei Shuang, you guys can leave now. Return to the Dragon Palace and continue to improve your strength!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them and said!<br/><br/>The main reason they were here was to temper themselves and gain a deeper understanding of the gods in the universe.<br/><br/>If they were to say that they could be of much help, they couldn’t.<br/><br/>They were still too weak!<br/><br/>“Also, I have a large number of faith hearts here. Bring them back!”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, he set up a devil spirit altar at the side. An Lie’s figure appeared very quickly!<br/><br/>“Alright, Dragon King.”<br/><br/>Bei Shuang and the rest nodded.<br/><br/>They knew that they were weak, especially here, where there were experts who believed in the universe everywhere.<br/><br/>After bei Shuang and the rest left, Wang Xian moved his palm and kept the five elements millstone before flying to the left.<br/><br/>According to the information that bei Shuang and the rest obtained, there were many experts who believed in the universe over there!<br/><br/>Hiding in the Void, Wang Xian flew all the way over there.<br/><br/>Only level eight gods could detect him by relying on the concealment ability of the Tai Chi Dragon Disk.<br/><br/>In addition, he might also possess an extremely powerful detection-type treasure.<br/><br/>However, it was obvious that a level eight pantheon would not be able to enter the starry universe!<br/><br/>Therefore, Wang Xian was basically invincible against the belief universe and the nine-origin universe here!<br/><br/>After flying for a few years, Wang Xian saw dozens of the gods of the belief universe flying in front of him!<br/><br/>His body moved and came directly to his side.<br/><br/>“Soul capture!”<br/><br/>Before they could react, he instantly controlled it.<br/><br/>Streams of information were transmitted into his mind.<br/><br/>“24 palaces Decree Palace, virtual spirit treasured land!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian received a piece of news, and his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>Believing in the 24 palaces of the universe, they sent a large number of gods into the starry universe.<br/><br/>During these millions of years, they found many treasure lands in the starry universe!<br/><br/>These treasure lands were occupied by them, increasing their strength!<br/><br/>The Void Spirit Treasure Land was a powerful treasure land that the decree palace had just found.<br/><br/>This void spirit treasure land was a treasure land that could increase one’s soul!<br/><br/>The power of belief involved the power of the soul.<br/><br/>A place that could increase one’s soul was naturally an extremely powerful treasure land for the gods of belief.<br/><br/>They could use the soul power contained in that place to create soul armors through their special methods!<br/><br/>They could create soul battle spirits!<br/><br/>They could use the power of their faith and some battle techniques to create soul battle spirits, forming an extremely powerful battle subordinate.<br/><br/>It was just like the Dark Ghost clones of the Dark Clan.<br/><br/>They could use their special methods to create a special dark ghost avatar!<br/><br/>Other than that, they could also create armor with extremely powerful defense.<br/><br/>Currently, this void spirit treasured land was the most powerful treasured land occupied by the 24 palaces of the Faith Universe!<br/><br/>This treasured land was occupied by the Decree Palace. However, in order to obtain this place, more than a dozen palaces had worked together to kill the powerful space beast that occupied this place and then occupied it!<br/><br/>At that time, more than ten palaces had sent out over a thousand level seven gods!<br/><br/>Over a thousand such powerful existences had occupied this place. One could imagine the experts guarding this space beast.<br/><br/>One could also imagine how important this place was to the belief of the universe gods!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
