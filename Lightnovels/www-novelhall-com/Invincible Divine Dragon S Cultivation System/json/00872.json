We will use all our strength to kill them completely! ”<br/><br/>“No problem. Apart from killing them, we will launch a general attack. Even if we can’t destroy the Space City in the nine-origin universe, we must find out their trump cards. ”<br/><br/>“Yes, the Elders’orders are to launch a general attack. This general attack will determine our next situation. We can’t keep wasting time with the 9-origin universe. We’re all here, so there’s no need to waste time.”<br/><br/>More than 10 million years passed.<br/><br/>During these 10 million years, they had been completely wasted by the five battle teams of the 9-origin universe. They didn’t dare to separate, and the few legions had been gathering together.<br/><br/>Even though they were powerful when they were gathered together, their targets were larger!<br/><br/>The Great Disciples of the 9-origin universe had gone into hiding. Even if they had encountered and killed them, there were only a few dozen of them.<br/><br/>It was impossible for them to encounter a large number of the great disciples of the 9-origin universe.<br/><br/>However, once their powers were scattered, they might be attacked.<br/><br/>Over the past 10 million years, although they had not suffered any losses, they had completely wasted their time here.<br/><br/>Now, after more than 10 million years, they had received some news from the believers of the 9-origin universe, and they were able to lock down two of the five battle teams of the 9-origin universe.<br/><br/>Besides, they were prepared to launch a general attack on the space beast after destroying these two battle teams.<br/><br/>A general attack on the space city.<br/><br/>If they could break through it, then they would win a great victory.<br/><br/>If they couldn’t succeed, then they could test out the strength of the 9-origin universe and then make a long-term plan!<br/><br/>“Get ready to start. Faith tracking. ”<br/><br/>In a piece of space in the Space universe, the eight armies of the faith universe gathered together.<br/><br/>The leader was the trump card of the eight armies of the faith.<br/><br/>Some were space beasts at the level 6 realm.<br/><br/>Some of them were powerful battle treasures.<br/><br/>The eight faith legions, close to a thousand level 7 gods, and close to ten million gods and believers.<br/><br/>Their strength was extremely terrifying!<br/><br/>The eight legions gathered together, and the eight commanders looked at each other.<br/><br/>“Faith Tracking! ”<br/><br/>A Level 7 God gave another order, and with a wave of his arm, an item floated in the air.<br/><br/>“Weng, Weng, Weng!”<br/><br/>This item was a portrait of an expert from the angel race that they had obtained.<br/><br/>In the belief tracking of the universe, there were certain conditions required for tracking.<br/><br/>For example, the true name of the pursuer, some information about the pursuer, and the item of the pursuer.<br/><br/>For example, the portrait of the pursuer.<br/><br/>For example, the karma of the pursuer.<br/><br/>The more items one obtained, the easier it would be to track.<br/><br/>If they could get their hands on the tracker’s items, it would be easier.<br/><br/>In the past tens of millions of years, they had obtained a portrait of a great warrior from a battle team in the 9-origin universe.<br/><br/>Through the portrait, they could conduct faith tracking!<br/><br/>Waves of faith power condensed in the sky, and countless shadows of believers appeared.<br/><br/>They prayed and tracked.<br/><br/>Faith tracking was very troublesome and a huge project.<br/><br/>If they wanted to chase after an expert who was at the level seven realm, they would need to use the strength of at least five to six legions.<br/><br/>Just like the tracking of Wang Xian, a large number of strong believers from ten legions had to use the tracking of faith.<br/><br/>“This nine-origin universe is much stronger than we thought. We thought we could destroy it easily. ”<br/><br/>A level seven pantheon could not help but sigh!<br/><br/>“The 9-origin universe is one of the top-tier existences in the universe. It Won’t be easy to destroy them! ”<br/><br/>Another Level 7 god said.<br/><br/>“That’s true. The strength of the belief universe is one of the top-tier existences in the Universe!”<br/><br/>The Level 7 god nodded.<br/><br/>There was a hierarchy in the universe.<br/><br/>This hierarchy was based on the strength of the experts in the universe.<br/><br/>The 9-origin universe was not weak among all the universes.<br/><br/>At this time, in the sky, the immense power of faith condensed into a haircut and pointed in a certain direction.<br/><br/>“The lock has succeeded. Now, we have to pay attention to how to surround them. Otherwise, once they escape, it will be very difficult for us to catch up.”<br/><br/>A tier 7 pantheon spoke up!<br/><br/>“We have a sealing treasure here. Next, we might have to rely on the Netherworld Palace’s side! ”<br/><br/>A tier 7 pantheon looked towards a palace’s army.<br/><br/>One of the 24 palaces, the Netherworld Palace!<br/><br/>“No problem. Our Netherworld Palace’s nethersound is enough to immobilize them. The Nine Star Palace’s side is dealing with another battle team. We can’t let this battle team from the nine-origin Universe escape. Otherwise, it will be too embarrassing!”<br/><br/>The seventh-tier gods led by Nether Heavenly Palace nodded indifferently.<br/><br/>“Alright! ”<br/><br/>The gods nodded and smiled!<br/><br/>“Go, pursue! ”<br/><br/>The ten million legions of the eight palaces immediately attacked. They were mighty and carried an invincible might.<br/><br/>Their speed was very fast. With the guidance of the faith tracking, they were very close to their target in two years!<br/><br/>“The target is very close to us. Explode, go! ”<br/><br/>The gods of the eight palaces immediately increased their speed and flew forward.<br/><br/>At the same time, a group of more than 500 experts was floating in the starry sky not far ahead.<br/><br/>These more than 500 experts came from the twelve peak races.<br/><br/>The twelve peak races were the black tortoise race that was good at defense, the ELF race that was good at long-distance, the dark race that was strange in assassinations, the powerful skeleton experts, and so on.<br/><br/>When they worked together, compared to when the experts of a single race worked together, their strength would be doubled!<br/><br/>This was also the reason why they were able to create trouble for the belief universe over the past ten million years.<br/><br/>There were over five hundred experts, and the weakest was a ruler of the sixth stage. Among them, the number of rulers of the seventh stage had reached one hundred and fifty.<br/><br/>After all, it was the combined power of 12 pinnacle races.<br/><br/>However, right at this moment, a great being at the level of a ruler at level seven of the wizard race suddenly felt a sense of fear and looked toward a direction.<br/><br/>“Not good! There’s a huge amount of faith energy rushing toward us. This is a huge faith universe army. Let’s escape immediately! ”<br/><br/>This great being at the level of a ruler at level seven of the Wizard race took out a compass. When he saw the information on it, his expression changed greatly, and he immediately shouted!<br/><br/>The group of Great Beings from the 9-origin universe did not hesitate at all. They immediately fled into the distance.<br/><br/>Weng<br/><br/>“Those who believe in the mighty faith and the gods will gain eternal life! ”<br/><br/>“Those who believe in the mighty faith and the gods will gain eternal life! ” “Those who believe in the mighty faith and the gods will gain eternal life!” Right at this moment, an extremely terrifying sound wave energy attacked them.<br/><br/>This vast voice instantly enveloped them.<br/><br/>Those who believed in the vast and mighty, believed in the gods, obtained eternal life!<br/><br/>When this voice entered their ears, they seemed to hear countless exhortations and rushed into their minds..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
