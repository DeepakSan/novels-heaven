Now, once they were united, they would form a force with discipline and rules like the racial force.<br/><br/>Some City Lords would have to follow the orders of the other city lords.<br/><br/>This benefit was needless to say. When the forces were united, they would definitely reach a terrifying level.<br/><br/>The disadvantage was that they had to submit to others!<br/><br/>The city lords’expressions kept changing.<br/><br/>“Don’t be anxious. I know that you don’t want to submit to others or be bound. But now that the alliance has reached this stage, there is no choice. The unity this time can be temporary. As long as we destroy the Dragon Palace, the alliance will still be the same as before!”<br/><br/>The Alliance Master of the Hundred Cities Alliance said lightly.<br/><br/>The city lords’expressions softened when they heard this, and they looked deep in thought.<br/><br/>Now, the Hundred Cities Alliance had no way out.<br/><br/>For them, there were two options. One was to give up their own city, take their trusted aides away, and hide for a period of time before coming out.<br/><br/>The other was like what the Alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance had said. They could combine their powers and destroy the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>“Alliance leader, can we destroy the Dragon Palace once we combine our powers? The Dragon Palace has a universe ruler level three godly dragon with close to 30 level two godly dragons. can our powers destroy the other party?”<br/><br/>One of the city lords asked the most crucial question.<br/><br/>They didn’t want to lose their city leader position, and they didn’t want to lose their current power.<br/><br/>However, could they destroy the Dragon Palace once they became one?<br/><br/>If they couldn’t destroy it, they might as well not be the city leader and directly lead their trusted aides to develop again.<br/><br/>“The Holy Dragon lineage has already agreed to give us all of our rewards. This is a huge amount of resources. When the time comes, I will make some improvements and become invincible below the universe ruler realm.”<br/><br/>The alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance said indifferently.<br/><br/>“The level of invincibility below the universe ruler realm?”<br/><br/>When the city leaders heard this, they were slightly moved!<br/><br/>“In addition, they will lend us a connate true treasure!”<br/><br/>The alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance added, his gaze sweeping across all the city leaders in front.<br/><br/>He did not force them. Now that he was forcing them, it would be easier for them to have second thoughts.<br/><br/>Once he said these words, he knew what they would choose.<br/><br/>“Alliance Master, we believe in You, but once we destroy Dragon Palace, we hope to be able to restore the Hundred Cities Alliance and restore the previous rules!”<br/><br/>One of the city lords’eyes lit up, and he immediately responded.<br/><br/>As long as the Alliance Master had an innate true treasure, he could easily kill a great being of the same level.<br/><br/>Not to mention, the Alliance Master could be upgraded by one wave this time.<br/><br/>“Sure, my goal is the ancestral wizard realm.”<br/><br/>The Alliance Master of the Hundred Cities Alliance said lightly.<br/><br/>“If the Alliance Master can become an ancestral wizard, we are willing to work for you!”<br/><br/>The city lords immediately bowed respectfully, their eyes shining.<br/><br/>“Maybe this day won’t be long!”<br/><br/>The alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance revealed a smile.<br/><br/>Although 15 cities had been destroyed this time, it wasn’t a bad thing for him!<br/><br/>The Sacred Dragon Clan saw how powerful the Dragon Palace was and was afraid that the Hundred Cities Alliance would retreat, so they offered all the treasures and resources they had promised.<br/><br/>One of the items that was extremely important to him was also sent over.<br/><br/>That item might be the key to open the universe ruler realm.<br/><br/>That item, along with the innate true treasure that the sacred Dragon Clan had lent him, he was confident that he could easily kill a great being of the same level.<br/><br/>Even if it was a godly dragon, it wouldn’t be able to escape from his grasp!<br/><br/>“We agree with your plan, Alliance master, to unite the hundred cities into one!”<br/><br/>When the city lords heard this, their eyes burned with passion.<br/><br/>If the Alliance Master of the Hundred Cities Alliance could become an ancestral witch, it would be of great benefit to them.<br/><br/>Ancestral witches were the true pinnacle experts in this universe.<br/><br/>“Gather all our forces and come here. The Dragon Palace will be destroyed soon!”<br/><br/>The Alliance Master of the Hundred Cities Alliance ordered.<br/><br/>“It’s the Alliance Master!”<br/><br/>The city lords immediately responded.<br/><br/>Soon, something that shocked all the forces happened in the heaven opening primal continent.<br/><br/>One hundred cities!<br/><br/>One hundred cities, a true power!<br/><br/>It was not as loose as it used to be!<br/><br/>“Fog grass, one hundred cities? They were forced by dragon palace to such an extent. One hundred cities, it means they are no longer a neutral city!”<br/><br/>“The Hundred City Alliance was completely forced to the final stage, but once one hundred cities are completely united, this power will be absolutely terrifying!”<br/><br/>“That’s only natural. When the 100 cities are united, there should be around 200 to 300 universe rulers with Combat Power alone, right? There are also quite a few universe rulers fighting at level two!”<br/><br/>“In the past, the 100 city alliance was relatively loose. Once they were united, they would be absolutely terrifying. This is also to prevent them from being defeated one by one!”<br/><br/>“Once the 100 City Alliance is United, Dragon Palace will most likely be in trouble.”<br/><br/>“Every city in the Hundred Cities Alliance has a very deep foundation, comparable to a high-level race. Now that they’re united, they’re probably driven into a corner by the Dragon Palace. I think they’re going to destroy the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>The Hundred Cities Alliance caused quite a stir.<br/><br/>Many experts even thought that once the Hundred Cities Alliance joined forces, its terrifying strength wasn’t something the Dragon Palace could withstand.<br/><br/>This was something that many experts agreed with.<br/><br/>Since the Hundred Cities Alliance had become one, they could also imagine that the first thing the Hundred Cities Alliance would do was to destroy the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>This was because the hatred between the two sides could no longer be resolved!<br/><br/>Since the Hundred Cities Alliance had been forced to become one, it would be a fight to the death!<br/><br/>The Hundred Cities Alliance vs the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>The following war would be even more tragic!<br/><br/>If they thought that the 100 cities alliance was going to be defeated a few days ago, now they thought that it might be about to be reversed!<br/><br/>“HMM? The 100 cities have merged into one?”<br/><br/>In the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian was the first to receive the news of the 100 cities merging into one.<br/><br/>When he saw this news, his eyes lit up!<br/><br/>Currently, the City Lords of the cities had led their subordinates to move.<br/><br/>Those cities had completely turned into empty cities.<br/><br/>All the powers were gathered together and were located at the base of the Alliance of one hundred cities.<br/><br/>As for the location of the base, Wang Xian also knew about it.<br/><br/>“Once they merge with each other, it will indeed be more troublesome. However, it’s also a good opportunity to compete with their real strength!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. He pondered for a moment and walked out directly.<br/><br/>He wanted to go to the base of the Hundred Cities Alliance!<br/><br/>He wanted to meet the leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance!<br/><br/>He wanted to get a thorough understanding of the other party before proceeding with the next plan!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
