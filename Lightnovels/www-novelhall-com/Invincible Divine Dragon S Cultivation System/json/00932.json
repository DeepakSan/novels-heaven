Instructor he’s figure appeared as well. His gaze swept across every student.<br/><br/>When his gaze landed on Wang Xian, he was slightly stunned. His gaze flickered slightly.<br/><br/>With Wang Xian’s current strength, he could naturally sense it clearly.<br/><br/>He was at level eight of the Eternal Swordsman.<br/><br/>This was completely out of his expectations.<br/><br/>20,000 years ago, he clearly remembered that Wang Xian was only at level four of the Eternal Swordsman.<br/><br/>Could it be that he was hiding something.<br/><br/>However, he only paused for a moment before shifting his gaze.<br/><br/>An existence at the eternal realm was not worthy of his attention.<br/><br/>After all, to the Void Sword Emperor, the eternal swordsman was like a child.<br/><br/>“According to the usual practice, all students will have a sparring session and have a ranking. ”<br/><br/>Teacher he continued, “I hope that some students from our class can enter the top 20 of our sacred academy this time. The rewards for this assessment will be very rich. ”<br/><br/>The assessment was held once every 20 ,ooo years. At the same time, it was also the sparring session for all the disciples of the Songyi Sacred Academy.<br/><br/>Songyi Sacred Academy would have a ranking.<br/><br/>In Songyi Sacred Academy’s Elementary Academy, the students were all below the immortal level. In the Advanced Academy, they would teach the immortal level students.<br/><br/>As for the void level existences, they needed to join the sacred academy and become the core disciples and experts of the Sacred Academy.<br/><br/>In less than 20,000 years, Songyi Sacred Academy would have a test and a ranking.<br/><br/>Students with a higher ranking would receive huge benefits.<br/><br/>This reward was extremely attractive to all students.<br/><br/>The competition that was held once every 20,000 years was a grand occasion for students.<br/><br/>And those who could rank in the top 30 were all the proud sons of Heaven of Songyi Sacred Academy.<br/><br/>If they performed well, they might even be taken in as disciples by some top-tier powerhouses.<br/><br/>If they were taken in as disciples by universe-level powerhouses, it could be said to be a meteoric rise.<br/><br/>Therefore, the students of the Ming Yi Sacred Academy placed great importance on this ranking.<br/><br/>Every 20,000 years, they would go all out in the sparring matches.<br/><br/>This was an opportunity for them.<br/><br/>Now that they had turned on their communication devices, the ranking of the students of the Sacred Academy was in a very eye-catching position.<br/><br/>When the students heard teacher he’s words, their eyes sparkled with excitement.<br/><br/>They couldn’t help but discuss among themselves in low voices.<br/><br/>Wang Xian didn’t recognize anyone around him. He stood there quietly.<br/><br/>He was rather interested in the upcoming sparring session.<br/><br/>He wanted to see how strong he was.<br/><br/>“This time, let’s strive to enter the top 30! ”<br/><br/>In the middle, a young man clenched his fist and said with a smile!<br/><br/>“In the class, eternal swordsman of level nine, come out and stand over here! ” “Eternal swordsman of level eight, stand over here and line up! ”<br/><br/>Instructor he waved his arm and drew out a few positions out of thin air. He spoke to all the students!<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved and arrived at eternal swordsman of level eight.<br/><br/>The other students who were at the eighth level of the eternal swordsman also arrived.<br/><br/>When they saw Wang Xian, they were slightly stunned. Their faces were filled with astonishment.<br/><br/>“Fellow student, are you also at the eighth level of the Eternal Swordsman?<br/><br/>Pve never seen you before.”<br/><br/>Four young men and women who were at the eighth level of the eternal swordsman came over. The only girl looked at Wang Xian curiously and said.<br/><br/>(‘I just came here 20,000 years ago.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded at her.<br/><br/>“Wow, I didn’t expect that. It seems that you were pretty strong when you came here. Impressive, impressive. Hello, my name is Yin Xueyue. ” The girl said in surprise and extended her hand with a smile.<br/><br/>“Wang Xian! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded with a smile and shook hands with her.<br/><br/>“Hehe, let’s work hard together this time and see if we can enter the top 200 in the school! ”<br/><br/>Yin xueyue smiled at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded.<br/><br/>“Xueyue, with your strength, it should be easy for you to enter the top 200.<br/><br/>AIM higher, at least the top 150.”<br/><br/>At the front, the young man at level nine of the eternal swordsman looked at her and said with a smile.<br/><br/>His gaze swept across Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“I’m satisfied with being in the top 200. This time, our class can only rely on the two of you, Xu Xinrun and nie youwei.”<br/><br/>Yin Xueyue looked at the young man and woman in front of her and said.<br/><br/>In their class, only two people had reached level nine of the eternal swordsman.<br/><br/>“This time, my goal is to be in the top 30.”<br/><br/>Xu Xinrun’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit as he said.<br/><br/>“Be quiet. Next, Let’s start sparring. Students of the same level sparring, two by two. ”<br/><br/>At this moment, teacher he’s voice sounded.<br/><br/>Everyone immediately quieted down and began sparring.<br/><br/>Students of the same level sparring, against the strongest student of the same level.<br/><br/>The strongest student of the same level could challenge a student of a level higher than himself.<br/><br/>But under normal circumstances, they wouldn’t challenge a student of a higher level than themselves.<br/><br/>It was basically difficult to defeat a student of a higher level.<br/><br/>The sparring began one after another.<br/><br/>Every student was enveloped by the space defense power that teacher he had displayed.<br/><br/>This space defense power was equivalent to the defense of every student.<br/><br/>Whoever’s defense was broken through first would basically lose the match first.<br/><br/>The sparring began one after another while the rest of the students watched the battle from the side.<br/><br/>This method of teaching was something that Wang Xian agreed with very much.<br/><br/>There was a huge difference between the nine-origin universe and this sword and magic continent.<br/><br/>The duration of the battles was not very long. In a battle of the same level, when all the moves were used and the victor had not been determined, it was basically the same.<br/><br/>This was because they were all spatial attribute cultivators. If they could not determine the victor as soon as possible, it would be very difficult to kill the other party.<br/><br/>The battles ended one after another.<br/><br/>There were a total of more than 60 students. In just a few days, it was the turn for the eternal swordsman to spar with the level eight students.<br/><br/>In the class, there were a total of five eternal swordsman level eight students, including Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Who wants to go first?”<br/><br/>Instructor he looked at Wang Xian and the rest and asked.<br/><br/>“Yin Xueyue’s strength should be stronger than ours. Let him go last. Let’s go first. ”<br/><br/>A young man looked at Wang Xian and the rest and said with a smile!<br/><br/>sure!<br/><br/>Instructor he nodded his head.<br/><br/>“Then let me start first with this student Wang Xian! ”<br/><br/>The young man who spoke looked at Wang Yun and gestured with his hand.<br/><br/>“Alright! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head.<br/><br/>He also wanted to see the difference between him and the eternal swordsman who was at the same level as the eternal swordsman in the continent of Sword and magic.<br/><br/>The two of them flashed and arrived in the sky in an instant!<br/><br/>Below, instructor he waved his arm and a force of space enveloped them to prevent them from getting hurt.<br/><br/>Once this energy was broken by the opponent, the opponent would win.<br/><br/>“When did that Wang Xian enter our Songyi Saint Academy? He’s actually so strong?”<br/><br/>“I know. He joined US 20,000 years ago. I just didn’t expect him to be so strong. ”<br/><br/>“It’s only interesting when the eternal swordsman fights at the 8th rank..”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
