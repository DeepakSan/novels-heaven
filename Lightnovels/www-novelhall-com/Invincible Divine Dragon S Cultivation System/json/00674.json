That Dragon King seems to have been targeted by the old witch!”<br/><br/>Around the trading ground, a group of angels flew over. When they heard the discussions around them, they raised their eyebrows slightly!<br/><br/>“Sir, not long ago, the Dragon King’s clone was killed by the old witch and was about to be killed with a curse. We don’t know the exact situation yet, but some curious experts flew towards the old witch’s lair to check out the situation!”<br/><br/>A subordinate of an angel expert reported respectfully!<br/><br/>“Oh?”<br/><br/>The group of experts from the Angel clan raised their eyebrows slightly.<br/><br/>“I don’t wish for the Dragon King to die at the hands of the old witch. The Dragon King has a lot of fruits in his hands. If we can capture the dragon king, these fruits might be ours. We might even have a chance to obtain the fruits!”<br/><br/>An expert of the Angel clan said indifferently!<br/><br/>“Although the Dragon King is strong, he has a lot of treasures in his hands. Let’s wait for the news. Whether he dies or not, it is good news for us!”<br/><br/>“Yes, even if he doesn’t die, he’s probably injured by the old witch’s Attack!”<br/><br/>The few Angel powerhouses were talking.<br/><br/>“Look, the Dragon King is Here!”<br/><br/>“He’s really here. Wait, it’s not the Dragon King’s real body. He only has the strength of an ordinary universe dominator at level three. It should be his clone. Why is his clone back?”<br/><br/>“What’s going on? What’s going on with the Dragon King and the old witch?”<br/><br/>At this moment, exclamations came from the people who were in charge of the surroundings!<br/><br/>Everyone in the trading ground looked over with a look of astonishment!<br/><br/>In their line of sight, one of Wang Xian’s clones flew toward the trading ground and scanned the surroundings with a smile!<br/><br/>The clone came to the inner area of the trading ground. With a move of his palm, an ordinary embryo fruit appeared in front of him!<br/><br/>“Continue trading, the price is still the same as before!”<br/><br/>As he spoke, all the old monsters around him heard him clearly!<br/><br/>“This? The Dragon King has solved the old witch’s problem, and now he’s back to sell the ordinary fruit?”<br/><br/>“No Way, the Dragon King should have solved the old witch’s problem. What about the old witch?”<br/><br/>Around him, some old monsters were discussing in shock.<br/><br/>The old witch wanted to deal with the Dragon King, but the Dragon King came back in just a few days?<br/><br/>So he used his doppelganger to continue selling the fruit!<br/><br/>Did he solve the old witch’s problem?<br/><br/>Or was there some other situation?<br/><br/>Although the old monsters were shocked, many old monsters who hadn’t been able to buy the fruit from the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace still went to trade!<br/><br/>This time, some of the old freaks who were originally harboring some petty thoughts also withdrew their thoughts!<br/><br/>Even some of the powerful teams were looking at Wang Xian with sparkling eyes and didn’t dare to act Rashly!<br/><br/>Everyone knew the old witch’s strength. She had taken away the Dragon King’s clone. Under such circumstances, it was already a huge advantage for a Magus!<br/><br/>If she couldn’t do anything to the Dragon King, and he wasn’t even injured, then the Dragon King’s strength was too strong!<br/><br/>There were some teams that were prepared to join forces to deal with Wang Xian. Now, they had to reconsider!<br/><br/>Time passed little by little. Wang Xian continued to sell the fruits of the womb. This made his gains more and more!<br/><br/>On the fifth day, a piece of news spread and caused a huge sensation!<br/><br/>An old monster from the Invincible Zone went to the old witch’s lair to check it out!<br/><br/>In the end, he saw a piece of news that shocked them. The old witch’s lair, the Forest Hut in the Invincible Zone, was in ruins. Basically, it was all destroyed!<br/><br/>It was obvious that a fierce battle had taken place in the surroundings, and the entire small house in the forest had been destroyed!<br/><br/>The old witch’s old nest had been destroyed, and the old witch had disappeared without a trace. and the Dragon King had appeared in the trading area. What did this mean?<br/><br/>“This? Could it be that the old witch had been killed by the Dragon King? “How is this possible? This is the old witch, the strongest wizard in the invincible zone. In her own nest, should she be the strongest existence in the invincible zone? “But the old witch’s nest was destroyed. How powerful is she?”<br/><br/>“Could it be that the old witch has been killed by him, the mad demon restriction, and the old witch? This… This Dragon King killed two mad demons of our Invincible Zone?”<br/><br/>“I can’t imagine how powerful the old witch in her own nest is. Can she fight against three or four mad demons? She was even defeated by the Dragon Palace. It’s very likely that she was killed by the Dragon King. This…”<br/><br/>At this moment, all the powerful old monsters in the invincible zone were completely shocked!<br/><br/>The old witch’s nest was destroyed. She was the strongest wizard in the Invincible Zone!<br/><br/>In her nest, she was almost the strongest existence in the invincible zone.<br/><br/>However, such an existence was unknown!<br/><br/>It was obviously the Dragon King’s doing!<br/><br/>How Strong was the Dragon King?<br/><br/>I can’t imagine!<br/><br/>“This? The old witch’s nest was destroyed. It’s very likely that she died at the Dragon King’s Hands?”<br/><br/>When the dozen or so angels of the Angel clan heard this news, their pupils constricted slightly, and their faces were filled with shock!<br/><br/>“This strength is too abnormal, isn’t it? With such strength, can the power in our hands destroy the Dragon King?”<br/><br/>An angel couldn’t help but speak out!<br/><br/>They had a powerful Angel army in their hands!<br/><br/>There were even 500 angels with the combat strength of level three universe overlords!<br/><br/>However, the strength that the Dragon King had displayed made them doubt if they could kill him with these angel armies!<br/><br/>“We need to investigate the specific situation. If the Dragon King is really that powerful, we need to report this to the third Prince!”<br/><br/>An expert from the angel race said!<br/><br/>The strength that the Dragon King had displayed was too powerful!<br/><br/>A Level 3 universe overlord with battle strength needed at least 30 people to deal with a true level 1 universe overlord!<br/><br/>And a crazy demon could easily kill a Level 1 universe overlord!<br/><br/>And that Dragon King could kill three or four crazy old witches in his lair!<br/><br/>With the power in their hands, it was extremely difficult for them to kill the Dragon King!<br/><br/>Of course, all of this had to happen after the old witch was killed by the Dragon King.<br/><br/>“I really don’t understand how the Dragon King can be so monstrous!”<br/><br/>The experts of the angel race sighed in their hearts!<br/><br/>If the old witch was dead, the Dragon King would have killed two crazy demons from the Invincible Zone!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
