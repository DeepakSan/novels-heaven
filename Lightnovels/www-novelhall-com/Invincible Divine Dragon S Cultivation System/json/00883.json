Go<br/><br/>Translator: 549690339<br/><br/>“This Dragon King of the Dragon Palace… ”<br/><br/>In front of the city wall, all the powerhouses of the top races stared at Prime Minister Gui.<br/><br/>Their faces were full of shock.<br/><br/>“Prime Minister Gui, has the Dragon King been fighting against the Army of the belief universe?”<br/><br/>A great Elf of the elf race couldn’t help but ask Prime Minister Gui.<br/><br/>“Yes, our Dragon Palace has already entered the belief universe 30 to 40 million years ago!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui turned his head and nodded with a smile, he continued,<br/><br/>“There are 24 palaces in the belief universe, and each of them has an army. There are seven to eight pantheon-level experts in this army, and each of them has a powerful trump card. Now, two of them have trapped the Dragon King of our Dragon Palace in an area with the powerful Tianyuan destiny fragment. ”<br/><br/>“As for the Army of the Heaven Origin Palace, they have all been destroyed by our Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>As Prime Minister Gui said this, the experts of the peak races were even more shocked!<br/><br/>There were still two armies that were using the fragments of a treasure of the heaven origin creation realm to pin down the Dragon King?<br/><br/>This was the heaven origin creation realm!<br/><br/>A treasure of this level was equivalent to an invincible existence.<br/><br/>It was equivalent to a heavenly yuan creator-level powerhouse.<br/><br/>Even if it was a fragment, it was still an extremely terrifying existence.<br/><br/>It could at least burst out with the destructive power of a peak dominator, right?<br/><br/>Two legions and such a treasure only trapped the Dragon Palace Dragon King in one place for more than 30 million years without killing him. How terrifying was the Dragon Palace Dragon King and the others?<br/><br/>And how much did the Dragon Palace do for the 9-origin universe in these tens of millions of years.<br/><br/>If the belief universe really had such terrifying power, the 24 palaces and 24 legions, the peak races of the 9-origin universe, were really no match for them!<br/><br/>The gap was even huge!<br/><br/>“I didn’t expect the Dragon Palace Dragon King to do so much. ”<br/><br/>The Great Elf of the elf race sighed slightly and looked around, he said indifferently, “It seems that some races have wronged the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Without the Dragon Palace, it’s hard to say if our 9-origin universe would be able to survive in the starry universe!<br/><br/>His words caused some of the experts of the peak races to nod silently.<br/><br/>“So it’s all our fault for wronging the Dragon King. This Dragon King has contributed more to our 9-origin universe than all the other peak races combined! ”<br/><br/>“That’s right. In the past tens of millions of years, the Dragon King has fought against half of the power of the belief universe. How terrifying! ”<br/><br/>“The contribution of the Dragon Palace to the nine-origin universe is indeed much greater than that of the other peak races. The Dragon Palace is the real hero behind the scenes. Not long ago, we even blamed the Dragon Palace! ” At the back, the disciples of all the races whispered.<br/><br/>Some of the disciples looked at the Phoenix and Angel races with sparkling eyes.<br/><br/>At this moment, all the powerful disciples of the Phoenix race looked extremely embarrassed.<br/><br/>After all, they had just attacked the Dragon Palace not long ago!<br/><br/>They had even publicly provoked the Dragon Palace and said in the communication stone plate that the Dragon Palace didn’t contribute anything to the nine-origin universe and wasn’t worthy of being a peak race that believed in the universe.<br/><br/>But Now?<br/><br/>It was simply a slap in the face!<br/><br/>Most importantly, the Dragon King’s strength had already exceeded the Phoenix clan ‘s expectations.<br/><br/>Putting everything else aside, the Dragon King’s strength was definitely not something the Phoenix clan could contend against!<br/><br/>And now that they had provoked the dragon palace and even killed more than a dozen experts of the Dragon Palace, what if the Dragon King came back to take revenge?<br/><br/>At the Angel clan, all the expert disciples frowned. Their expressions were also ugly!<br/><br/>“Attack! Don’t waste time talking to them. First, kill all of them from the<br/><br/>9-origin Cosmos. Then, we will go and kill the Dragon Palace Dragon King!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the cold voice of the cosmos gods was transmitted from the front.<br/><br/>“Hong! Hong! Hong! ”<br/><br/>In the next second, waves of extremely terrifying energy came out from their bodies.<br/><br/>More than 20 million great beings from the belief universe erupted with terrifying power.<br/><br/>The wind and clouds changed color, the sky and earth changed color, and the starry sky changed color!<br/><br/>This vast power of belief made all the great beings and disciples in the 9-origin universe reveal solemn expressions.<br/><br/>The powerful warriors of the belief universe were too powerful!<br/><br/>“The power of the belief universe is indeed not something we can contend with !<br/><br/>A powerful warrior of the elf race murmured.<br/><br/>Some other powerful warriors nodded in agreement.<br/><br/>“I really don’t know how the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace deals with half of the power of the belief universe!”<br/><br/>Some disciples murmured at the back.<br/><br/>If the power of the 21 legions of the belief universe wasn’t blocked by the Giant Star City, just this vast power alone could instantly kill them!<br/><br/>“Prepare the array formation to resist!”<br/><br/>“Prepare! ” “Weng Weng! ”<br/><br/>“Weng Weng! ”<br/><br/>“Weng Weng! ”<br/><br/>At this moment, all the powerful warriors of the shaman clan shouted loudly and instantly activated the array formations!<br/><br/>“Weng Weng! ”<br/><br/>“Weng Weng Weng! ”<br/><br/>However, just as all the great beings and disciples of the 9 -origin universe thought that war was about to break out…<br/><br/>Just as the Great Beings of the belief universe were about to make their move…<br/><br/>Suddenly, all the level seven gods received a message.<br/><br/>The sudden emergency message made all the level seven gods of the belief universe slightly stunned.<br/><br/>They didn’t hesitate and immediately opened their communicators!<br/><br/>Because this message came from an emergency message from an elder in their palace.<br/><br/>Even if a great war was about to break out, they still had to investigate!<br/><br/>However, when they opened the contents of the communicator and saw it, their eyes instantly widened and revealed an incredulous expression!<br/><br/>“This is impossible! ”<br/><br/>“How is this possible? How is this possible?”<br/><br/>Immediately, the rank seven gods shouted in shock!<br/><br/>They had received an order!<br/><br/>An order to retreat!<br/><br/>There was naturally a reason for this order.<br/><br/>The experts that were chasing after the Dragon King had all been killed.<br/><br/>They had all been killed by the Dragon King and the ancient god kun-master! The ancient god Kun-master of the Dragon Palace and the Kun were already comparable to the peak gods that they worshipped in the universe!<br/><br/>Now, the elders in their palace immediately ordered them to retreat.<br/><br/>All the legions had to split up to prevent being attacked by the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King!<br/><br/>Looking at this information, they had to split up to escape and not be discovered by the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King.<br/><br/>The expressions of all the rank seven gods were extremely ugly!<br/><br/>They had just told the experts of the nine-origin universe that they would destroy the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King!<br/><br/>But now, the Dragon Palace Dragon King had instead annihilated the experts of the universe they believed in!<br/><br/>This? ? ? ?<br/><br/>But the Dragon Palace Dragon King already had a peak existence of all gods.<br/><br/>It was no longer something they could withstand!<br/><br/>Once they were discovered by the Dragon Palace Dragon King and the others, they would definitely suffer heavy losses.<br/><br/>If the gods of their 21 palaces were injured here, this loss was something the belief universe couldn’t bear!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
