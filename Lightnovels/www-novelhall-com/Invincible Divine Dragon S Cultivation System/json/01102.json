Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>The two Heaven’s origin powerhouses in the Void Universe teleported away quickly.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest chased after them from behind.<br/><br/>They left behind a group of stunned disciples from the Ao Huo tribe.<br/><br/>In the depths of the Ao Huo tribe, powerhouses flew out one by one.<br/><br/>They looked at the energy that was gradually disappearing. Their faces were filled with fear and horror.<br/><br/>“Is this the powerful enemy from the outer universe that the leader of the Divine Fire tribe mentioned?”<br/><br/>“It should be. The energy that exploded just now was at the peak of the universe ruler realm, and this was under the suppression of our universe. I heard that they are all existences in the Heavenly Yuan Destiny Realm. They are truly terrifying. Immediately report to the Divine Fire Tribe. ”<br/><br/>“The nine-origin universe? And that strange teleportation ability. What is this? Why did they invade us? What is it for? The calamity hasn’t arrived yet. ” The experts of the Ao Huo tribe spoke with lingering fear.<br/><br/>Although their ao Huo tribe had existences at the peak of the universe ruler realm, they knew that the ones invading their universe were all existences at the Heavenly Yuan realm.<br/><br/>Fortunately, with the suppression of the universe, the strength of the invaders could be reduced to below the Heavenly Yuan realm. They immediately spread the news to the divine fire tribe.<br/><br/>“Boss, who are they?”<br/><br/>At the same time, Lin Niu asked Wang Xian with a face full of surprise.<br/><br/>“They are the Heaven’s origin of the Void Universe. The Void Universe and our nine-origin universe are enemies. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew quickly and frowned. (‘I don’t know the exact situation either. But from the looks of it, when the powerhouses of the two universes meet, it will be a war! ”<br/><br/>Looking ahead, he could no longer sense the traces of the two powerhouses in the Void Universe.<br/><br/>The space attribute was almost invincible in terms of speed.<br/><br/>Earlier, Wang Xian’s wind and thunder force could not hit the other party.<br/><br/>“Boss, now that our traces have been exposed, where are we going now?” Lin Niu asked.<br/><br/>“For safety’s sake, let’s leave this fire field and head to the grassland.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before speaking!<br/><br/>The situation just now might be noticed by the powerhouses of the six paths of the universe.<br/><br/>If they had a way to find their tracks and treasures, Wang Xian and the rest would still be in great danger.<br/><br/>“Also, we have to be careful of those two guys from the Void Universe. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian added with a hint of coldness on his face.<br/><br/>Those two guys from the Void universe were not worried about being exposed at all by relying on their spatial attribute abilities.<br/><br/>Lin Niu nodded his head.<br/><br/>“If they dare to attack again, we must lock onto them with the force of wind and thunder. We must make them pay the price! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew towards the direction of the grassland as he muttered.<br/><br/>His eyes revealed a cold expression.<br/><br/>“That guy from the nine-origin universe has a strong reaction. In addition, he has the fire attribute. We can’t do anything to him. ”<br/><br/>At the same time, on top of a mountain in the distance, two heaven origin creator powerhouses from the Void Universe spoke.<br/><br/>“With our strength, it’s true that they can ‘t do anything to us. ”<br/><br/>Another void master nodded and looked to the right. “According to the spatial fluctuations, they should be heading toward the Grassland!”<br/><br/>“Should we call a senior over? If a senior comes over, we should be able to kill them. ”<br/><br/>The void master beside him asked.<br/><br/>“Those seniors might not come over. Our main goal is also for the heavenly fate true treasure. ”<br/><br/>The other void space great being shook his head. “Let’s focus on the heavenly creation true treasure.”<br/><br/>“Ask if any seniors are at the six-path universe grassland. If they are there, they shouldn’t mind taking action. ”<br/><br/>The void space great being said unwillingly.<br/><br/>In the last calamity, his entire army and a large number of his descendants were all killed by the Great Beings of the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>If there was a chance to kill the Great Beings of the 9-origin universe, he would definitely not give up.<br/><br/>“Then let’s ask if there’s any senior over at the grassland. ”<br/><br/>The other void space great being hesitated for a moment before nodding his head.<br/><br/>The Void Space universe only had one type of space attribute. Logically speaking, their entire universe could only give birth to one heaven origin creation great being.<br/><br/>However, due to their powerful space attribute, during the calamity, the heaven origin creation great being of the Void Space universe would bring his disciples who had the chance to make a breakthrough and enter a universe with space attribute.<br/><br/>In that universe, they would occupy the space attribute slot of that universe and then break through.<br/><br/>This also created the aggressive character of the Void universe.<br/><br/>The Void Universe was able to fight against the nine-origin universe without being at a disadvantage. Their strength was very powerful.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor and the other powerhouses of the nine-origin universe would have long exterminated them.<br/><br/>The two experts from the Void Universe moved and flew toward the grassland.<br/><br/>They quickly teleported to the front and left some space eyes in the void. Once they passed through here, they would enter the line of sight of the space eye and be discovered.<br/><br/>The space eye was very secretive and difficult to discover.<br/><br/>Even if they were discovered, they already knew the information obtained by the space eye.<br/><br/>They were also able to determine the location of the other party.<br/><br/>Many existences who had just entered the heaven’s origin manifestation level would find it difficult to discover this secret technique of theirs.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. ”<br/><br/>The two heaven’s origin manifestation powerhouses left some space eyes in the void and left immediately.<br/><br/>It was impossible for them to continue wasting time with Wang Xian and the rest.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and Lin Niu headed forward. They maintained the speed of a level five universe dominator.<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian’s entire body was enveloped by the aura of the wood attribute. He was holding a wooden staff in his hand.<br/><br/>They were extremely vigilant.<br/><br/>After flying for a day, Wang Xian felt something and looked in a certain direction.<br/><br/>Without any hesitation, he waved his arm and a surge of energy shot towards the right.<br/><br/>In an instant, the sky on the right exploded and the space attribute spread out.<br/><br/>Space attribute? are those two guys from the Void Universe still targeting us?”<br/><br/>Lin Niu looked over. A hint of anger flashed in his eyes as he spoke.<br/><br/>“HMM, they should be monitoring us. Let’s go. Let’s take a detour.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before speaking.<br/><br/>It was impossible to change their destination.<br/><br/>Moreover, since these guys from the Void Universe wanted to deal with him, how could Wang Xian not want to take revenge.<br/><br/>He possessed the five elements attributes in his body, and the energy could be converted to each other.<br/><br/>As long as he was not in the land of the dead, he would have a huge advantage.<br/><br/>He was not afraid of the powerhouses from the Void Universe at all.<br/><br/>Moreover, as long as the power of wind and thunder landed on their bodies, it was hard to say who would deal with whom! “Boss, since they want to deal with us, let’s play with them.”<br/><br/>Lin Niu said with a face full of killing intent.<br/><br/>Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. “Let’s play with them.. We can put aside the matter of the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan! “\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
