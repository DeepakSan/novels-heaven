Giggle! ”<br/><br/>The child seemed to feel extremely comfortable as he started laughing.<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed the situation and his expression changed slightly.<br/><br/>He held the little boy in his arms and a wave of energy entered his body to check on his condition.<br/><br/>Through Wang Xian’s senses, he could sense that there was a tender bud in the child’s body.<br/><br/>A green tender bud!<br/><br/>It grew abruptly in his body.<br/><br/>Although it was very small, it contained extremely pure wood-type energy.<br/><br/>This energy was filled with toughness and sharpness.<br/><br/>It was completely different from the energy of the ancestral tree.<br/><br/>This was not a supplementary heaven’s origin creation treasure.<br/><br/>Instead, it was an offensive type!<br/><br/>“It’s a heaven’s origin creation treasure that has just been born. It’s 100% true. This Heaven’s origin creation treasure actually grew in the body of a child and was connected to the child’s Life! ” “Now, I can take this Heaven’s origin creation treasure away! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was certain in his heart.<br/><br/>Now, he could take the Heaven’s origin creation treasure away with 100% certainty!<br/><br/>However, if he wanted to take away this ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin, the little boy would probably die instantly.<br/><br/>The Little Boy’s life was connected to the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin.<br/><br/>It was very strange.<br/><br/>This situation was very strange!<br/><br/>“Young master, you’re awake. I didn’t expect tianci to be so close to you.” Mu Liyin ‘er looked over and said to Wang Xian with a smile on her face!<br/><br/>“Were you the ones who saved me?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them and asked.<br/><br/>“It was Our Lady who saved you and brought you here. If it wasn’t for Our Lady, you might have died. Our Lady said that saving you could be considered as doing our young master a favor! ”<br/><br/>The maid beside Mu Liyin’er said to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“Thank you for saving my life, Young Lady! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at Mu Liyin’er and thanked her. He had some changes in his heart!<br/><br/>He was already thinking about how to get his hands on the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan. In the end, this woman saved him.<br/><br/>The worst part was, she even said that she was doing good deeds for her child?<br/><br/>This? ?<br/><br/>This child in front of him had the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan in his body.<br/><br/>If Wang Xian didn’t take it away, in the eyes of others, there was definitely something wrong with his brain.<br/><br/>Even if he took away the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation, this child would die.<br/><br/>However, to existences at their level, the life of a child was incomparable to the life of the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation.<br/><br/>Not to mention a child, even 100 million or 99% of the powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin creation would take action.<br/><br/>To be able to cultivate to such a level, which one of them wasn’t an existence that massacred cities, countries, and races?<br/><br/>Which one of them didn’t have the blood of tens of millions of lives on their hands?<br/><br/>What kind of existence was the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin?<br/><br/>“I’ve repaid kindness with enmity! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian felt a little helpless. He didn’t expect such a multiple choice question to appear in front of him!<br/><br/>Other people saved him to build up goodwill for the child, not to let him kill her child.<br/><br/>“No need to thank me. It was just a simple task! ”<br/><br/>Mu Liyin’er shook her head. “Your injuries are very serious. Rest well. When you’ve recovered, you can do other things! ”<br/><br/>“Thank you for your concern! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and squatted down to put the little boy down. “Go and find your mother! ”<br/><br/>However, the little boy did not listen to her. He continued to hug him with both hands and refused to let go!<br/><br/>This made him a little speechless.<br/><br/>At the side, Mu Liyin ‘er saw this scene. She shook her head and walked over.<br/><br/>“Come, tianci. Come and follow your mother! ”<br/><br/>Mu Liyin ‘er stretched out her hand and wanted to carry tianci away.<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>However, in the next second, Tianci started to cry. He was unwilling to leave with Wang Xian in his arms.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this scene, his mind moved and he hid the ancestral tree.<br/><br/>The reason why Tianci was so close to him and wanted to be close to him was because Wang Xian had the ancestral tree in his body.<br/><br/>The two wood-attribute heaven origin destiny-level treasures were both at the stage of growth.<br/><br/>During the transformation of the energy just now, Wang Xian could clearly feel the subtle changes in the ancestral tree.<br/><br/>This change was a good thing for the ancestral tree.<br/><br/>The attraction of the ancestral tree made Tianci instinctively want to get close to him.<br/><br/>“Alright, Tianci, don’t Cry, Don’t Cry! ”<br/><br/>Mu Liyin ‘er carried tianci over and began to comfort him!<br/><br/>“I’ll go to my room to cultivate and recover from my injuries. I Won’t disturb you anymore. I’ll thank you again when Miss Mu Li is free! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian watched and bowed to them before walking into the room.<br/><br/>“Alright! ”<br/><br/>Mu Liyin nodded and continued to coax Tianci.<br/><br/>“This little tianci sure knows how to cause a ruckus. Come, come, let Grandma<br/><br/>Hug You! ”<br/><br/>The woman at the back walked over and comforted him.<br/><br/>The few of them coaxed the child.<br/><br/>Wang Xian took a glance and his expression changed slightly when he entered the room.<br/><br/>After a few minutes of silence, he shook his head helplessly.<br/><br/>“Forget it. If I can’t come up with any good ideas, then forget it. Let’s see if the ancestral tree can obtain something useful from it after it grows up, even if it’s just a branch.”<br/><br/>In the end, Wang Xian decided to let go.<br/><br/>He had his own principles. If someone provoked him, he would definitely return the favor tenfold.<br/><br/>However, now that the other party had helped him, Wang Xian could not repay kindness with enmity.<br/><br/>Although the temptation of the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan was too great, he could not touch his bottom line.<br/><br/>Moreover, after the short end of the relationship with tianci, he realized that the ancestral tree could also benefit from the contact with the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan in his body.<br/><br/>However, the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan in his body had just been born, so the effect was not very obvious yet.<br/><br/>“I’ll stay here for the next period of time. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian made up his mind and sensed the situation outside. He closed his eyes and began to recover from his injuries.<br/><br/>Creak<br/><br/>After an unknown number of days, Wang Xian’s door was suddenly opened.<br/><br/>This made him focus his gaze slightly and looked toward the door.<br/><br/>Following that, he saw a brain poking in and a pair of big eyes looking at him.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this, he smiled..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
