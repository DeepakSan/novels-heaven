A smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>“There is already a universe knight level 5 being parasitized by the Ba Qi. According to the information from the Ba Qi, there is another universe Knight Level 5 being hidden by the horned seal race. There are a total of seven of them.”<br/><br/>“He is confident that he can kill two universe knights of the same level the moment the war breaks out.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui said with a smile.<br/><br/>“That means there are still four universe knight level 5 beings, Tian Cheng, Xiao Lan, and Ao Jin. It will be easy for them to deal with the other four. To be on the safe side, I will go too.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian pondered for a moment and said.<br/><br/>With the current strength of the Dragon Palace, even if he did not make a move, it would be enough to wipe out the horned seal race and the Snake Lady Race. However, he was prepared to make a move just in case.<br/><br/>Going Straight to the other party’s nest, there was still a trace of risk.<br/><br/>As an incomparably powerful mid-level race in the universe, they had a deep foundation, and they might have treasures that could fight against knights at level 6.<br/><br/>However, the Dragon Palace had a strong advantage, and that was the eight points.<br/><br/>The eight points had already latched onto a pinnacle great being of the Horned XI clan, and they knew all the trump cards of the Horned XI clan.<br/><br/>With the help of the Ba Qi, everything would be much simpler.<br/><br/>“Order all members to prepare!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood up and said in a deep voice.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui replied immediately.<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>Soon, in the Dragon Field of the Dragon Palace, all the leaders and universe knight level members of the Dragon Palace were standing there and waiting.<br/><br/>Other than the Universe Knights of the Dragon Palace, there were only over 10,000 dragon wizards.<br/><br/>This was the team that the Dragon Palace sent out this time.<br/><br/>The ordinary members of the other combat divisions didn’t allow them to participate.<br/><br/>That was because there was absolutely no need.<br/><br/>And now, after several consecutive improvements, the number of universe knights in the Dragon Palace had reached nearly 4,000.<br/><br/>Such a number was not weak even among the middle-level races in the universe.<br/><br/>After all, the number of universe knights in the Water Dragon Palace was only around 5,000 to 6,000.<br/><br/>“Let’s go, we’ll rush over directly.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze across all his subordinates and revealed a satisfied expression.<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>Their bodies moved, and they flew to the sky above the Dragon Palace in an instant.<br/><br/>“Wu Wu!”<br/><br/>A low and muffled sound was heard. Two gigantic creatures were suspended in the air.<br/><br/>Xiao Lan’s current size had already reached 500 to 600 kilometers.<br/><br/>His strength had also broken through to the level of a universe knight level five.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Xiao Zhai was one level weaker, a universe knight level four.<br/><br/>At this time, Little Blue’s aura was abnormally terrifying.<br/><br/>If Little Blue’s aura was targeted at the members of the Dragon Palace, even ao Jin and the others would probably feel suppressed.<br/><br/>The Pinnacle inheritance of the universe, the ancient god Feeding Kun master, the Divine Dragon Phoenix and other peak bloodlines as food, kun.<br/><br/>Below the same level, even pure-blooded divine dragons were no match for Kun.<br/><br/>Only the mutated divine dragons could contend against the Kun.<br/><br/>Now, Xiao Lan and the small house might be the only two Kun in the universe.<br/><br/>“Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s body moved and leaped onto Xiao Lan’s body.<br/><br/>The rest of the members of the Dragon Palace immediately flew onto Xiao Lan’s small house.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. The target is the horned seal race!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian patted Xiao Lan’s body and ordered faintly.<br/><br/>Xiao Lan possessed his own intelligence. His intelligence was very, very high.<br/><br/>“Woo Woo!”<br/><br/>Upon hearing the order, Xiao Lan let out a low growl and opened her mouth. A black hole instantly appeared in front of her.<br/><br/>Xiao Lan swayed her body and entered the black hole directly.<br/><br/>Behind her, the small house followed her into the black hole.<br/><br/>In the next moment, their figures disappeared instantly.<br/><br/>“Woo Woo!”<br/><br/>When they reappeared, they had already arrived at another piece of void space.<br/><br/>Xiao Lan let out a low growl. Another black hole appeared and they entered the space again.<br/><br/>Xiao Lan’s method of traveling was extremely terrifying. Even Wang Xian with the inoriginator holy wings couldn’t compare to her.<br/><br/>After just five hours, they arrived at the area surrounding the starry sky.<br/><br/>Once they arrived at the starry sky, they would often see spaceships, ships and other flying vehicles shuttling through the void.<br/><br/>“F * ck, what is this thing? It’s so terrifying?”<br/><br/>“Hiss, a space beast, this is a space beast? What grade of space beast is this, how can it be so terrifying?”<br/><br/>A terrifying black hole appeared out of thin air. Beside it, on a ship that looked like a dragon boat, everyone’s pupils slightly contracted when they saw the black hole.<br/><br/>However, when they saw the terrifying little blue fly out from the black hole, they were shocked.<br/><br/>Space Beasts were not rare to the people who surrounded the starry sky, but this was the first time they had seen such a huge space beast.<br/><br/>It was five to six hundred kilometers in size, and it was like a meteorite in the starry sky, emitting a terrifying aura.<br/><br/>“Hiss, what kind of space beast is this? What level is it?”<br/><br/>“This… This is too terrifying. Is this the space beast from the Heaven Opening Primal Continent?”<br/><br/>On the dragon boat, everyone looked at the huge beast in shock.<br/><br/>But in the next moment, Little Blue’s small house quickly disappeared from their sight.<br/><br/>Its speed was too terrifying!<br/><br/>“Oh? What a powerful space beast. What kind of beast is this?”<br/><br/>Xiao Lan quickly shuttled through the surrounding starry skies. When they passed through a planet, two elders were floating in the starry skies beside them. Their eyes were shining.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. Call the experts of our clan and follow these two space beasts. Let’s see if there’s a chance to subdue and suppress them!”<br/><br/>One of the elders said with a burning gaze.<br/><br/>They were also extremely envious of such a huge and terrifying space beast.<br/><br/>If they could subdue and suppress them, how domineering would their clan ride such a huge beast in the future.<br/><br/>Their bodies moved and immediately followed closely behind.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, someone is following behind us!”<br/><br/>At the same time, on Little Blue’s body, prime minister turtle’s gaze swept to the back and said solemnly.<br/><br/>Two figures followed behind them. Both of them had the strength of a level five universe knight.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. He glanced around and ignored them.<br/><br/>Xiao Lan’s body was too huge and her aura was terrifying. It was obvious that the two figures behind them did not sense their presence.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian and the rest ignored them.<br/><br/>A black hole appeared in front of them and Xiao Lan’s figure immediately disappeared.<br/><br/>“HMM? They have entered the black hole and I can’t sense them?”<br/><br/>Seeing Xiao Lan’s small house disappearing into the black hole, it made people’s pupils contract slightly and a solemn expression appeared on their faces.<br/><br/>As for the black hole, they did not dare to charge into it recklessly.<br/><br/>“Let’s look for it. They should be heading forward to cross the Void!”<br/><br/>The two were somewhat unwilling and quickly flew forward.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
