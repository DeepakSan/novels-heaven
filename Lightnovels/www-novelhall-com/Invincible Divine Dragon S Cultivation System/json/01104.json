The Heaven’s origin creation powerhouses in the six paths universe were in the right place at the right time.<br/><br/>In their own universe, they were invincible.<br/><br/>Unless there were more than ten Heaven’s origin destinies working together to take out their trump cards to attack one heaven’s origin destinies of the six paths universes.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it was impossible to fight against them.<br/><br/>“Let’s go, let’s continue to the Grassland! ” Wang Xian continued to speak to Lin Niu.<br/><br/>They flew towards the grassland again.<br/><br/>The two Heaven’s origin destinies of the Void Universe should be at the grassland.<br/><br/>It was impossible for them to target him.<br/><br/>Their target was the Heaven’s origin creation treasure.<br/><br/>There was no reason for the two heaven’s origin creation powerhouses to keep tracking them.<br/><br/>Therefore, Wang Xian determined that they were at the grassland.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the Unicorn ox arrived at the location of the grassland a year later.<br/><br/>The grassland of the six paths universe was a real grassland.<br/><br/>There were plants that stretched as far as the eye could see. There were all kinds of plants.<br/><br/>Occasionally, one could even see some trees and rivers that flowed past!<br/><br/>The entire grassland was exceptionally beautiful and filled with rich vitality. The rich vitality of the wood attribute made this area exceptionally beautiful.<br/><br/>“Begin the search! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved his palm and took out the skywriting compass. He looked at the information on it.<br/><br/>The Scouting treasure forged by the 12 ancestral warlocks was extremely effective.<br/><br/>In addition, the powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin realm who entered the six paths universe were usually located at the six treasured lands.<br/><br/>Therefore, the chances of Wang Xian and the rest finding them were very high when they searched the grassland.<br/><br/>“According to the 12 ancestral warlocks, there are more than 10 powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin realm in the Void Universe. I should be able to find them myself. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself and began to fly in the direction of the grassland.<br/><br/>He opened a map and began to search in a carpet-like manner.<br/><br/>“There is a tribe ahead. Let’s go there.”<br/><br/>After searching for more than half a year, Wang Xian looked ahead and spoke to the Unicorn Ox.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was carrying a wood attribute bow and arrow on his back. He was also holding a sharp wood attribute sword in his hand.<br/><br/>His body was emitting a wood attribute energy.<br/><br/>This kind of attire was very common in the prairie.<br/><br/>The Unicorn ox beside him was covered by Wang Xian’s wood attribute energy. If it wasn’t the Heaven’s origin ability, one wouldn’t be able to tell.<br/><br/>The tribes in the prairie were all located in a large forest.<br/><br/>The trees grew into the shape of houses. With a glance, it was exceptionally beautiful.<br/><br/>However, when Wang Xian had just entered the front of the tribe, the empty compass in his hand trembled slightly.<br/><br/>A ball of energy appeared on the empty empty compass.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw the change in the empty compass, his gaze froze slightly.<br/><br/>(‘I really didn’t expect to find a heaven origin creator in the starry universe here.”<br/><br/>The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as a smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>According to the information displayed on the empty text compass, the heaven origin creator from this starry universe was very far away from Wang Xian.<br/><br/>He was probably at another location in this tribe!<br/><br/>“Between the heaven origin creator and the six paths universe, both parties are trying their best to conceal their auras. Unless they are within a range of tens of thousands of meters, it would be difficult to discover the other party. ”<br/><br/>“This compass is very powerful. As expected of one that is specially made for the powerhouses of the Void Universe. However, the range of this compass is still limited. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled to himself. He gestured to the Unicorn Bull at the side and flew towards the other direction of the tribe.<br/><br/>“It’s just ahead. There are still about 20,000 meters left. ”<br/><br/>According to the information on the skytext compass, Wang Xian was calculating in his mind as he looked in that direction.<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not make a move immediately. In fact, he was not prepared to make a move himself.<br/><br/>It was impossible for him and Lin Niu to kill a heaven’s origin creator in the Void universe by themselves.<br/><br/>Therefore, he was prepared to borrow strength.<br/><br/>The twelve ancestral sorcerers had killed a heaven’s origin creator in the Void Universe.<br/><br/>In fact, they did not kill him personally.<br/><br/>Instead, they had placed a curse on him.<br/><br/>This curse was able to expose his body and attract the attention of the heaven origin creator in the six paths universe. Then, they would come and kill him.<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not have the ability to curse, but he did have an ability.<br/><br/>Void pursuit!<br/><br/>As long as he locked onto a heaven’s origin creator in the Void universe, he only needed to send the information to the Heaven’s origin creator in this universe.<br/><br/>As for such a message, Wang Xian already had a plan.<br/><br/>His body moved and he immediately flew into the distance, entering the interior of this tribe.<br/><br/>Soul capture! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s mind moved. His gaze locked onto a few powerhouses who were at level one and level two of the Masters of the universe. He immediately used the soul capture power!<br/><br/>Waves of information entered his mind.<br/><br/>Finally, he locked onto a middle-aged man.<br/><br/>This middle-aged man’s grandfather was an elder of this tribe. He had the strength of a level eight universe dominator.<br/><br/>The strongest leader of this tribe was only at the level nine of the universe dominator.<br/><br/>“Sure, let’s try it out!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian had a plan in his mind.<br/><br/>He controlled the middle-aged man who was at the second level of the universe dominator to come to an area more than 100,000 meters away from where the skywriting compass was pointing.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked in that direction and moved his palm.<br/><br/>The void energy of the incipient holy wings was condensed in his hand. He waved his arm and this energy accurately covered that area.<br/><br/>” HNIM?”<br/><br/>At the same time, an old man was sitting on a building in that area and drinking tea.<br/><br/>Suddenly, his gaze focused as he sensed a wave of energy coming towards him.<br/><br/>The energy wasn’t strong, but he wanted to avoid it, but he realized that he couldn’t avoid it at all.<br/><br/>“What’s the situation? It’s not the six paths universe’s attribute, it’s the wind and thunder attribute. ”<br/><br/>He instantly stood up and his figure immediately disappeared.<br/><br/>He teleported to a location in the sky, but at this moment, he sensed that the energy sitting on his body wasn’t the energy of the six paths universe.<br/><br/>“There are heavenly fate powerhouses nearby, from other universes. ”<br/><br/>His eyes instantly revealed a cold expression as he hurriedly sensed the energy that landed on his body.<br/><br/>“It’s not the power of a curse. It shouldn’t be the 12 ancestral warlocks of the nine-origin universe. ”<br/><br/>He inspected it and thought to himself.<br/><br/>However, he also discovered that this energy was attached to his body, and he needed to completely remove it.<br/><br/>Someone definitely wants to set me up. ”<br/><br/>He was certain in his heart. Without the slightest hesitation, he instantly teleported far away..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
