This time, I’ll see if I can suppress the Universe Knight level turtle-winged beast. In addition, I’ll subdue some desolate beasts at the peak of the Celestial Emperor Realm and sell them to prepare for the next thing.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to him with a smile.<br/><br/>“Oh? Did the Dragon Palace gain a lot this time?”<br/><br/>Tian Chen was delighted.<br/><br/>“Yes, so much so that if all the treasures can be exchanged for resources, it will be able to increase the number of universe knights in the Dragon Palace by 10 to 20.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded.<br/><br/>Tian Chen was slightly taken aback. His eyes were burning with excitement.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. I want to test the ability of that acquired spiritual treasure.”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, his body moved and he flew towards the center of the volcano region.<br/><br/>The sky array immediately followed behind.<br/><br/>Last time, the Dragon Palace mobilized all their forces to hunt down the universe knight-level blazing turtle winged beast from the volcano region.<br/><br/>However, he managed to escape easily in the end.<br/><br/>This time, if he could lock it down, it wouldn’t be able to escape anymore.<br/><br/>The two of them arrived at the center of the volcano region. Wang Xian waved his arm and the crescent moon in the sky was suspended in the air.<br/><br/>The Heaven Array looked over curiously.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Wang Xian injected a stream of light into the crescent moon in the sky. The faint light spread to the surroundings and disappeared.<br/><br/>He looked at the crescent moon in the sky and waited quietly.<br/><br/>Soon, images appeared in front of him. The images depicted everything within a radius of 50 to 60 billion kilometers.<br/><br/>“This… what a powerful numinous treasure. It can clearly see all the places around it. It can also transmit all kinds of things clearly.”<br/><br/>Heaven array was shocked when he saw the scene in the images.<br/><br/>Previously, the investigation compass he made could only detect black and red dots. There was no image at all.<br/><br/>Now, not only was there a picture, but he could also sense the power of the desolate beast in the picture.<br/><br/>It was extremely magical.<br/><br/>Wang Xian didn’t say anything. He scanned his surroundings and didn’t find any traces of the venerable level Turtle Blazed Wing Beast.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. Let’s fly forward.”<br/><br/>The volcanic region was very large. He wasn’t anxious even if he couldn’t find any traces of the venerable level Turtle Blazed Wing Beast.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it was very likely that the seraphic winged turtle was hiding very deeply. It was also possible that the crescent moon in the sky could not detect its tracks.<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew forward and arrived at the place where the crescent moon in the sky could only detect its limits. Once again, he let the crescent moon rise into the sky.<br/><br/>The bright energy dispersed in the surroundings. Wang Xian watched quietly as the image appeared bit by bit.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, what is this?”<br/><br/>Soon, an image appeared in front of them. The image was located below a volcano. A blurry outline appeared in their line of sight.<br/><br/>The outline was very blurry, but they could still vaguely see a shape.<br/><br/>“It’s that blazing turtle winged beast. It’s really hidden. It’s almost merged with the volcano.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes lit up. His eyes were burning with excitement.<br/><br/>He looked at the scene and said, “Conceal yourself. Let’s go. Let’s Get Closer!”<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The heaven’s formation nodded and immediately followed behind.<br/><br/>Soon, they arrived at the front of the volcano. Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at the heaven’s formation at the side.<br/><br/>The heaven’s formation nodded and immediately began to set up the formation.<br/><br/>After determining the location of the blazing turtle winged beast, it was much easier to move.<br/><br/>If the heaven formation was set up properly, Wang Xian might be able to suppress it without even needing to make a move.<br/><br/>The strength of the heaven formation was extremely terrifying among the level one universe knights.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and caused the five elements grinding mill to fly to the opposite location.<br/><br/>Following that, he summoned the battle Angel to ensure that nothing went wrong.<br/><br/>The crescent moon shone in the sky and locked onto the outline of the volcano in front of him. Wang Xian waited quietly.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, the formation has been set up. Once it is activated, the surroundings can be sealed instantly. There are also two trapping formations.”<br/><br/>A few minutes later, the Heaven Formation said with a smile.<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head. His body moved and he flew straight towards the volcano in front of him.<br/><br/>In the next moment, he appeared at the entrance of the volcano. He waved the five elements millstone in his hand and pressed downwards.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>The terrifying five elements millstone pressed downwards directly. Wang Xian extended his dragon claws and grabbed downwards as well.<br/><br/>“Woo Woo Woo Woo!”<br/><br/>At the area below, the turtle blazed winged beast, who was in a deep sleep and recovering from his injuries, sensed the sudden might coming from the sky and immediately woke up.<br/><br/>Its head popped out from the lava and revealed an extremely furious expression.<br/><br/>When it saw Wang Xian, its eyes were filled with fear.<br/><br/>“Woo Woo Woo Woo!”<br/><br/>It let out a furious roar and did not continue fighting. Instead, it dived into the lava in an attempt to escape.<br/><br/>“Boom Boom Boom!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the entire ground shook. An incomparably huge gray city wall rose from the surroundings, forming an indestructible defense.<br/><br/>Following that, water ropes were like giant pythons, twining towards the blazing turtle winged beast.<br/><br/>Following that, dense lightning gathered together.<br/><br/>Three venerable level formations were instantly activated.<br/><br/>“Wu Wu!”<br/><br/>Seeing the terrifying attacks that suddenly appeared around it, the blazing turtle winged beast’s eyes revealed a look of fear. It raised its head and roared.<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>At this moment, in the sky, the five elements great grinding together with the frost divine swords attacked the blazing turtle winged beast.<br/><br/>The sudden attacks caused the blazing turtle winged beast to have no time to dodge.<br/><br/>The Frost Sword landed on its body, weakening the flames on its body.<br/><br/>“Five Elements Dragon Claw!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s dragon claw enlarged. It was tens of thousands of meters long and was clawing at its body.<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>Terrifying columns of fire erupted around him and attacked Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw.<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>However, the water rope formed by the formation and the lightning that was condensed together spread to its body.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>It let out a blood-curdling scream as it rolled around in pain.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s dragon claws trembled slightly. The surrounding fire columns were suppressed as the huge dragon claws clawed at his body.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>“Woo Woo Woo!”<br/><br/>The Dragon Claws landed on its body, causing the blazing turtle winged beast to let out a panicked cry.<br/><br/>“Surrender or Die!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw suppressed it. The five elements were grinding on it, and the destructive power of the five elements was suspended on its body.<br/><br/>The threat of death enveloped it.<br/><br/>“Woo Woo!”<br/><br/>The Blazing Turtle Wings Beast’s body was trembling slightly. It let out a low roar and sent the message of surrender.<br/><br/>“Very good!”<br/><br/>Looking at the blazing turtle wings beast that was being suppressed, his eyes revealed an excited expression.<br/><br/>If he were to sell this blazing turtle wings beast, it would be another terrifying resource!<br/><br/>We’ve made a fortune this time.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
