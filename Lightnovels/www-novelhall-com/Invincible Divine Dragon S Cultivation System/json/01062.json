For example, in the nine-origin universe, there were nine Heaven’s origin creatures in the past.<br/><br/>Each attribute had one.<br/><br/>That was, metal, wood, water, fire, Earth, wind, thunder, light, and darkness, nine attributes.<br/><br/>In theory, it could give birth to dual, three, and five elemental heavenly fate, but that was only in theory.<br/><br/>At least in the history of the nine-origin universe, there hadn’t been any experts with such attributes.<br/><br/>The power of the nine-origin universe also made the heavenly fate experts of the nine-origin universe stronger, and they had more trump cards.<br/><br/>Long ago, a batch of disciples of the Phoenix clan had been taken away by the heavenly fate of the Phoenix clan to cultivate.<br/><br/>This batch of Phoenixes numbered over a thousand.<br/><br/>Now that they had returned, they were all at least level eight universe masters.<br/><br/>This was cultivated by the heavenly fate to deal with the upcoming calamity battle.<br/><br/>The calamity battle was an extremely terrifying battle.<br/><br/>Originally, this group of experts would return two billion years later before the calamity erupted.<br/><br/>But now, because of the appearance of the tree of chaos, they were all called back by the nine-origin universe’s Heavenly Yuan destinies.<br/><br/>Seventh Elder, the current Dragon King of the Dragon Palace should have inherited the entire divine dragon clan and has a large number of opportunities. ”<br/><br/>“Most importantly, in the starry universe, our experts can not enter, while in the nine-origin universe, the Dragon Palace has long been hiding. We don’t know where they are hiding. ”<br/><br/>“If they dare to appear, we can easily destroy them. ”<br/><br/>A Phoenix spoke to the flameflame Phoenix in the center.<br/><br/>Although the Phoenix who spoke was only the seventh elder of the Phoenix clan, his current strength was at the peak of the entire Phoenix clan.<br/><br/>Before he was taken away by the Heavenly Yuan creation realm experts of the Phoenix clan, he was already the seventh elder of the clan.<br/><br/>However, according to his strength, only a few Phoenix kings of the Phoenix clan could be compared to him.<br/><br/>“Humph, we used to be polite to the divine dragon clan, but now a small dragon palace dares to be so reckless. They dare to wantonly kill our Phoenix clan’s disciples. They are simply courting death. ”<br/><br/>The seventh elder said with a grim expression, his eyes full of killing intent.<br/><br/>“Seventh elder, if we meet the Dragon Palace in the future, we will definitely destroy them! ”<br/><br/>Some of the Phoenixes next to him said.<br/><br/>They knew that the seventh elder was so angry because a descendant of the seventh elder had died in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>However, regardless of the seventh elder’s anger, if they met the Dragon Palace in the future and found the nest of the Dragon Palace, they would definitely destroy it!<br/><br/>The group of Phoenixes flew quickly.<br/><br/>Soon, an extremely large and quiet place appeared in front of them.<br/><br/>The entire area, mountains, rivers, and forests, was extremely quiet.<br/><br/>All kinds of words were carved on the rocks.<br/><br/>Some white cranes were flying inside.<br/><br/>It was filled with the aura of books.<br/><br/>The sacred literature field.<br/><br/>The sacred literature field was said to be a learning field, but in reality, it was extremely large.<br/><br/>It was the Holy Land of countless cultivators from the saint lineage.<br/><br/>This place was also the base of the saint lineage.<br/><br/>This time, a group of disciples from peak races and all disciples at the Universe Knight level came here. It was also the decision of a group of heavenly creation stage Great Beings!<br/><br/>When they arrived, the other peak races had also arrived.<br/><br/>Apart from that, there were also countless disciples at the Universe Knight level.<br/><br/>They looked around with respect.<br/><br/>They were filled with respect as they looked at the numerous great beings.<br/><br/>This time, the number of great beings disciples gathered was unprecedented.<br/><br/>There were all beings above the universe knight level.<br/><br/>How many would there be?<br/><br/>Especially for pinnacle races, the number of universe Knight Disciples reached millions.<br/><br/>The other high-level races and even the middle-level races and independent cultivators numbered in the hundreds of millions.<br/><br/>However, the number of over a hundred million experts wasn’t too many!<br/><br/>After all, the creatures of the entire universe were too vast!<br/><br/>The disciples of the Phoenix race looked at the center and flew straight over.<br/><br/>In the center, the experts of the twelve peak races had already arrived.<br/><br/>The Water Phoenix King, Fire Phoenix King, and Golden Phoenix King of the Phoenix race were already there.<br/><br/>The leaders of the angel race, the skeleton race, and the Wizard race had also arrived in the surrounding areas!<br/><br/>After the powerful disciples of the Phoenix race arrived, they looked around and arrived at their respective positions!<br/><br/>The twelve peak races had gathered.<br/><br/>As time passed, more and more disciples above the venerable realm arrived.<br/><br/>A year later, almost all the powerful disciples arrived.<br/><br/>“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz! ”<br/><br/>At this moment, figures appeared in the sky above the sacred literature field.<br/><br/>Phoenixes, angels, Black Tortoise, and the Netherworld race.<br/><br/>Each of them had a vast power, and the Heavenly Yuan creation realm experts from all races appeared.<br/><br/>At this moment, all the disciples’ gazes landed on the eight figures.<br/><br/>“Greetings, Lord Tianyuan Creation. ”<br/><br/>“Greetings, Lord Tianyuan Creation. ”<br/><br/>All the disciples immediately knelt down when they saw the eight figures.<br/><br/>Especially the powerful disciples from the high-level and middle-level races.<br/><br/>They were extremely shocked when they saw the eight figures.<br/><br/>This was the first time they had seen an expert of Tianyuan creation since they were born.<br/><br/>An existence at this level was someone they had to look up to.<br/><br/>This was the true overlord of their entire universe!<br/><br/>They were also extremely shocked by the identities of these eight figures.<br/><br/>From the auras of these eight figures, they could also tell which faction these eight figures came from.<br/><br/>The disciples of many high-level races were still very shocked by the existence of the royal family who had the heavenly fate realm.<br/><br/>“Stand up. All the disciples above the venerable realm in the nine-origin universe have arrived, right?”<br/><br/>Wearing scholar’s clothes and carrying a brush and a scroll on his back, Saint Hetian glanced around and asked indifferently!<br/><br/>“Saint, except for the powerful disciples of the Dragon Palace, all the other powerful disciples have arrived. ”<br/><br/>An old man from the saint’s faction immediately answered respectfully. “Dragon Palace? The Divine Dragon Clan has risen again?”<br/><br/>When the Hetian Saint heard this name, a hint of surprise flashed across his eyes as he asked!<br/><br/>“Yes, Saint. The Dragon Palace is not weak now, but they had some conflicts with the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan, so they didn’t come. ”<br/><br/>The old man didn’t hide anything and continued to report.<br/><br/>The Heavenly Yuan creation realm powerhouses didn’t know about this..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
