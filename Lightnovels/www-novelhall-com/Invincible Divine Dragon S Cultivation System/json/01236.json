He needed some resources.<br/><br/>After returning to the Dragon Palace, Tianci brought a large amount of the flesh and blood of the river-migrating beast emperor back to the six paths universe excitedly.<br/><br/>The corpse of the nine-corpse Beast Emperor last time had greatly improved the Mu Li tribe.<br/><br/>The corpse of such an existence was a huge treasure trove for ordinary cultivators.<br/><br/>This time, they had obtained a huge amount of resources. It was enough to add another four to five experts at the peak of the ruler realm to their Mu Li tribe.<br/><br/>It was extremely difficult for ordinary heaven origin creation realm experts to obtain such a huge amount of resources.<br/><br/>Wang Xian returned to the nine-origin universe and temporarily had some free time.<br/><br/>However, not long after, the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor suddenly contacted him.<br/><br/>Senior Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian came to the devil race and saw the Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor welcoming him. He shouted with a smile!<br/><br/>“Hehe, Dragon King, come in and have a seat!”<br/><br/>The Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor smiled at Wang Xian and gestured. Wang Xian nodded and entered the main hall of the Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor.<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>In the main hall, a devil expert greeted Wang Xian respectfully when he saw him!<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head and swept his gaze across the hall.<br/><br/>Senior Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor, have you found a universe that can allow you to break through?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked with a smile.<br/><br/>“Yes, I found a universe. It’s not far from the nine-origin universe, but it’s not very close either. There’s still a slot for the darkness attribute of that universe. Pm afraid I’ll have to trouble you, Dragon King. ”<br/><br/>The Shadow Devil Emperor spoke to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“It’s no trouble. Senior, you’re in charge of the nine-origin universe. It’s only right for me to protect the other disciples. When can we set off? How’s the strength of that Universe?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked.<br/><br/>The devil race had disciples who could make a breakthrough. They needed to go to the universe with a slot.<br/><br/>Wang Xian needed to understand the strength of this universe in detail.<br/><br/>After all, occupying a quota in another universe was an invasion for the powerhouses in this universe.<br/><br/>They would suffer intense resistance from their universe.<br/><br/>There might even be a huge battle.<br/><br/>Therefore, Wang Xian had to understand the strength of this universe.<br/><br/>“Three powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin realm. All of them are at the beginner level and are not strong. If nothing unexpected happens, Jiuli should be able to make a breakthrough easily! ”<br/><br/>The shadow devil emperor said, “We can set off at any time! ”<br/><br/>“Alright! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded. “Then let’s set off now. I have nothing to do now. Don’t worry, senior. I will let the disciple of the devil race complete his breakthrough! ”<br/><br/>“Thank you, Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>The Shadow Devil Emperor cupped his hands at Wang Xian. “Thank you, Dragon King, for protecting my path! ”<br/><br/>At the side, Jiuli from the devil race thanked Wang Xian excitedly.<br/><br/>“No need. We are both beings from the nine-origin universe. This is what I should do! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head.<br/><br/>“This is the coordinates of that universe. Be careful. I have a clone there.<br/><br/>Dragon King, contact me when you arrive! ”<br/><br/>The Shadow Devil Emperor passed Wang Xian the coordinates and reminded him.<br/><br/>“Oh? Alright! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and looked at Jiuli.<br/><br/>Jiuli bowed to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>He waved his arm and brought the disciples of the demon race out of the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>Wang Xian came to the chaos outside the nine-origin universe. He took out the location given by the Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor and opened it.<br/><br/>(‘I will keep you in my storage space first. I will summon you when we arrive! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke to Jiuli!<br/><br/>“I’ll listen to your arrangements, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Jiuli nodded.<br/><br/>Wang Xian kept him in his mother nest and flew toward the coordinates.<br/><br/>The universe that Jiuli had broken through was found by the Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor’s clone.<br/><br/>It was called the Arnold Universe.<br/><br/>It was a universe with a very strange name.<br/><br/>Disciples with a strong background had great benefits.<br/><br/>At the very least, they didn’t have to risk their lives to search for a universe that they could break through.<br/><br/>Even an avatar of the Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor was still waiting there.<br/><br/>This kind of treatment wasn’t something that the skeleton clan and the divine tiger clan could compare to.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was flying rapidly in the chaos.<br/><br/>Coupled with the power of teleportation, his speed was extremely terrifying.<br/><br/>However, even if Wang Xian was very fast, it wouldn’t be a matter of a day or two to reach there.<br/><br/>It would even take him tens of thousands of years to fly there.<br/><br/>The distance between the universe and the universe was still very far!<br/><br/>Of course, the Dragon Palace had a bug like an lie.<br/><br/>If Wang Xian wanted to come back, it would be very easy!<br/><br/>He traveled quickly through the chaos.<br/><br/>On the way, Wang Xian even saw some creatures from other universes flying in the chaos.<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not linger on the way.<br/><br/>Everything revolved around the breakthrough of the demon disciples.<br/><br/>If the breakthrough was completed, he could take a stroll around.<br/><br/>Time passed day by day.<br/><br/>Soon, Wang Xian flew in the chaos for more than 10,000 years.<br/><br/>He looked at the distance and saw that there were still a few thousand years of flying time.<br/><br/>Five thousand years passed in the blink of an eye once again. In front of him, an incomparably huge universe appeared in his line of sight.<br/><br/>The Cataclysm had arrived. Each universe was like a sun in the chaos, extremely eye-catching.<br/><br/>One could see it clearly from a great distance.<br/><br/>Wang Xian took out his communication device and sent a message to the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor!<br/><br/>After that, he continued to fly towards that universe.<br/><br/>More than ten days later, Wang Xian arrived in front of this universe.<br/><br/>“Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>At this moment, the Shadow Devil Emperor also appeared at the front and flew over.<br/><br/>Senior! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded. He waved his arm and let Jiuli out. “Greetings, Lord Shadow Devil Emperor! ”<br/><br/>Jiuli immediately bowed to the Shadow Devil Emperor!<br/><br/>“Get up. We will bring people into their universe to make a breakthrough. It will attract the attention of the entire universe. When the time comes, we will need you to intimidate them, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor spoke to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“No problem. If they don’t agree, we will fight! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded.<br/><br/>This was the law of Chaos in the Aeon.<br/><br/>Strength was king.<br/><br/>If anyone tried to stop them, they would fight and kill them.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest’s methods were considered relatively mild during the aeon.<br/><br/>If some evil-aligned powerhouses encountered a weak universe, they might not even be able to make a breakthrough.<br/><br/>They might even slaughter all the living beings in the universe.<br/><br/>They would absorb blood and eat flesh to increase their strength.<br/><br/>This kind of thing was very common during the calamity..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
