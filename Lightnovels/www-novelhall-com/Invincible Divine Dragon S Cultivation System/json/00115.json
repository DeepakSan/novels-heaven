If the five elements millstone wanted to suppress it, it would take a lot of time.<br/><br/>“What is the situation on the fourth level now?”<br/><br/>Looking at the power contained within the fourth level and at the front of the entrance, senior brother Junzi and the rest looked at it with astonishment. They did not dare to step into it.<br/><br/>“I wonder how big brother Wang Xian is doing now.”<br/><br/>“Big Brother Wang Xian is very strong. There should be no problem.”<br/><br/>Some disciples of the willow deity Daoist sect whispered.<br/><br/>They didn’t dare to step inside and could only wait here.<br/><br/>As time passed by, senior brother Lu and the rest were slightly anxious.<br/><br/>The powerhouses from their race had already been inside for an hour and had yet to come out. Coupled with the powerful aura inside, they were probably doomed.<br/><br/>If there really was a problem, their losses would be huge.<br/><br/>“Flaming Saber!”<br/><br/>“Frost Sword!”<br/><br/>In the fourth level, Wang Xian’s cold voice rang out.<br/><br/>A blazing flaming saber and an extremely cold frost sword were suspended on the left and right of the Battle Angel.<br/><br/>After an hour of battle, the light on the battle Angel’s body was much weaker.<br/><br/>One of its wings had already been broken. There were thorns twining around its legs.<br/><br/>“Slash!”<br/><br/>When the Battle Angel saw the Flaming Saber and the water-cold sword, she charged forward again without knowing fatigue or pain.<br/><br/>“Hehe!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian chuckled. He flapped his incipient saint wings and immediately grabbed towards the crescent moon in the middle of the sky.<br/><br/>“No one is allowed to touch it without the owner’s order!”<br/><br/>When the battle angel saw Wang Xian grabbing towards the acquired spiritual treasure, her attack slowed down and she roared coldly.<br/><br/>She quickly changed her target and slashed at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Humph!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian dodged to the side. The Flaming Saber and the ice sword locked onto the Battle Angel and landed on his back.<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>The wings of the battle angel flapped and beams of bright wings slashed at the flaming saber and the ice sword.<br/><br/>Bang<br/><br/>However, the powerful impact still caused her to fall forward.<br/><br/>“Alright, I can’t attack anymore. I have to think of a way to restrain it!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes lit up.<br/><br/>After an hour of battle, he had discovered a weakness of the battle angel.<br/><br/>As long as he retrieved the crescent moon illumination, the battle angel would divert its attention to deal with him.<br/><br/>This reduced the time needed to deal with the battle Angel by a lot.<br/><br/>Now that the Battle Angel was once again severely injured, it would be much easier to suppress it.<br/><br/>The metal-attributed metal cage trapped the battle Angel while the wood-attributed thorns entangled it. The water-attributed water current restrained it while the earth-attributed soil suppressed it.<br/><br/>Waves of Suppressive Force continued to engulf the Battle Angel.<br/><br/>The Battle Angel, whose combat strength was greatly reduced, struggled to break through the waves of restraints and entanglement.<br/><br/>However, under the interference of Wang Xian and the continuous attacks of the five elements grinding, the battle Angel was completely restrained after half an hour.<br/><br/>The power of the five attributes covered it. Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face as he flew over and removed the core of the battle Angel from its head.<br/><br/>The core of a universe knight-level battle Angel was located in the head. Compared to an ordinary battle angel, it would be impossible to remove it unless it was completely suppressed.<br/><br/>“A battle angel at the level of a universe knight… Tsk Tsk, if this is sold, it will definitely cause an uproar in the entire Milky Way!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled with excitement. He removed the core and modified some instructions. Following that, waves of energy were injected into his body.<br/><br/>The Battle Angel was made from a special biological material. It had the ability to recover automatically.<br/><br/>The recovery rate was determined by the injuries sustained.<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and kept it into his interspatial ring.<br/><br/>Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at the center of the fourth floor. The crescent moon was shining brightly in the sky.<br/><br/>“Eh? The terrifying aura in the fourth floor has disappeared?”<br/><br/>At this moment, senior brother Junzi and the rest who had been waiting for news at the entrance of the fourth floor saw the terrifying aura suddenly disappear. Their expressions changed and their eyes shone brightly.<br/><br/>“The aura has disappeared. Should we go over and take a look?”<br/><br/>Senior Sister Lingxin hesitated for a moment and said.<br/><br/>“The aura has disappeared. The danger inside might have been eliminated by Big Brother Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>A disciple of the willow deity Daoist sect guessed.<br/><br/>“Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>Senior brother Lu frowned and immediately flew towards the fourth level.<br/><br/>The people beside him immediately followed closely behind.<br/><br/>Senior Brother Junzi and the rest did not hesitate any longer. They flew in together with the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect.<br/><br/>“That is?”<br/><br/>As soon as they entered, they saw Wang Xian standing in front of the acquired Numinous Treasure Illuminated by the crescent moon in the sky.<br/><br/>They paused for a moment as their eyes revealed a burning look.<br/><br/>“Junior brother Wang Xian is about to obtain that acquired Numinous Treasure. This is a very powerful auxiliary numinous treasure!”<br/><br/>Senior Sister Lingxin exclaimed in surprise.<br/><br/>“Junior brother Wang Xian has eliminated the danger of the fourth level.”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Junzi nodded his head and replied.<br/><br/>“Elder Yue!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the middle-aged elder who followed senior brother Lu and the rest saw a corpse not far away. His expression changed drastically as he shouted in alarm.<br/><br/>“Old Yue!”<br/><br/>Senior brother Lu’s expression changed as he flew towards the corpse immediately.<br/><br/>The old man beside him also changed his expression and followed behind.<br/><br/>Feeling the lifeless corpse, they looked extremely embarrassed.<br/><br/>“Elder Yue actually died. Damn it!”<br/><br/>The old man beside senior brother Lu clenched his fists and roared in a low voice.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>At this moment, the entire fourth level trembled slightly. They sensed something and looked towards the center.<br/><br/>When they saw Wang Xian holding the acquired spiritual treasure, their eyes were filled with envy and passion.<br/><br/>This was the most powerful weapon of the Crescent Moon Venerable. They heard that it possessed an unbelievable ability.<br/><br/>“That Wang Xian’s harvest is too great!”<br/><br/>Senior brother Lu’s breathing was slightly hurried as he spoke.<br/><br/>One acquired spiritual treasure, over a thousand powerful divine weapons, and over ten thousand powerful battle angels.<br/><br/>This treasure was comparable to the treasures of seven or eight top-tier domain-level races.<br/><br/>“If we don’t get some precious treasures this time, we’ll suffer a great loss!”<br/><br/>The old man beside him sighed and muttered unwillingly.<br/><br/>“We got it!”<br/><br/>In the center of the fourth floor, looking at the acquired spiritual treasure crescent moon shining in the sky, excitement flashed in his eyes.<br/><br/>Holding it in his hand, the crescent moon shining in the sky emitted a faint light power. Waves of special energy surged into his mind.<br/><br/>He did not immediately study it. Instead, he glanced at the books around him. His body moved and he immediately went over to investigate.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
