All of them would fall below the heavenly fate realm.<br/><br/>There was a huge gap between the beginner level and the control level.<br/><br/>However, under the suppression of the universe, this gap was not as big as before.<br/><br/>A beginner level versus a control level, under the suppression of the situation, it was still possible to last for more than ten days!<br/><br/>After all, when the energy was suppressed, the damage would be reduced.<br/><br/>Therefore, the figure was confident that he could restrain a heavenly yuan creator.<br/><br/>“Hehe, alright, since that’s the case, let’s do it! ”<br/><br/>Duke Tian men nodded with a smile and gestured to him.<br/><br/>The group stepped into the teleportation formation again.<br/><br/>When they entered, they took out the spatial needle and flew in a certain direction.<br/><br/>“Guang Ying, take this spatial pointer. It can point to the location of your target. We will follow you from behind. ”<br/><br/>“When the spatial pointer has all the information, inform US immediately. Then go over and tie down the target pointed by the spatial pointer. We will rush over immediately from behind. ” Lord Tianmen instructed Guang Ying.<br/><br/>“No Problem! ”<br/><br/>The figure nodded, took the spatial pointer, and flew quickly in the direction that it was pointing at.<br/><br/>Because they were directly teleported to the edge of the water source.<br/><br/>Therefore, when the figure flew for half a year, there was information on the spatial pointer.<br/><br/>“The target is very close. The spatial pointer has already reacted. I will immediately rush over and tie it down! ”<br/><br/>When the figure saw the information on the spatial needle, he immediately reported to the Duke of Heaven’s Gate and the others!<br/><br/>“Okay, be careful! ”<br/><br/>The Duke of Heaven’s Gate and the others immediately replied with a message!<br/><br/>“Hehe, this job is really simple. Casually tying down a guy can result in a great harvest. Hehe! ”<br/><br/>“Moreover, tying down a person is very simple. You Don’t have to do it yourself. ”<br/><br/>A faint smile appeared on the figure’s face.<br/><br/>He looked at the line of defense pointed by the spatial needle and put it away. Then, he flew over quickly!<br/><br/>He concealed his figure and pretended to be ignorant as he flew.<br/><br/>Soon, he saw Wang Xian’s figure in his line of sight.<br/><br/>At the same time, he sensed something in his heart. He sensed that Wang Xian was an outsider who didn’t belong to the six paths universe.<br/><br/>“It should be him. He is a heaven origin creator.”<br/><br/>The figure thought to himself. He looked at Wang Xian and sent out a message with a slight movement of his palm.<br/><br/>“The power emitted from his body is obviously at the beginner level. Five powerhouses from the Void Universe killed a beginner-level heaven origin creator, and he actually asked me for help? “He must have some treasure that can detect the space attribute. Hehe! ”<br/><br/>The light figure’s eyes sparkled as he laughed in his heart.<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian noticed the arrival of the light figure from the front.<br/><br/>He also noticed the strength of the light figure at this moment.<br/><br/>Darkness attribute.<br/><br/>A powerhouse of the Heaven’s origin.<br/><br/>Just like him, he came from another universe.<br/><br/>Wang Xian saw him sizing him up and narrowed his eyes slightly.<br/><br/>Following that, he turned around and prepared to leave without saying anything to him.<br/><br/>After he arrived at the six paths universe, he had already met two to three other powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin manifestation.<br/><br/>Both parties basically left without saying a word.<br/><br/>This time, Wang Xian did not intend to have any dealings with him!<br/><br/>“My friend, wait a minute. Are you a powerhouse of the wood attribute?”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian displayed the energy of the wood attribute with his true dragon body.<br/><br/>If he did not engage in a battle, even a heaven’s origin creator would not be able to sense it.<br/><br/>He looked at Wang Xian and asked.<br/><br/>“HMM? What’s the matter?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked surprised when he saw a foreign heaven’s origin creator suddenly greeting him.<br/><br/>He looked over and asked!<br/><br/>“It’s nothing. It just so happens that I have a wood attribute treasure in my hands. Are you interested in making a deal?”<br/><br/>The figure looked at Wang Xian and asked with a smile.<br/><br/>He had a look of friendliness on his face.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard his words, he was stunned.<br/><br/>A trade? He wanted to make a trade directly when he met him?<br/><br/>This made him a little puzzled!<br/><br/>Buzz Buzz<br/><br/>At this moment, he sensed that the empty compass in his mother nest was trembling slightly. There was something on it!<br/><br/>When he sensed it, his gaze focused slightly and his mind changed slightly. He looked at the darkness attribute heavenly fate expert in front of him and his heart turned cold!<br/><br/>His mind instantly changed. With a flick of his hand, he took out the Taiji Dragon Compass.<br/><br/>“Oh? Do you have a wood attribute treasure in your hands? Then we can make a trade. I do have a special treasure in my hands. This treasure is very special. When Light and darkness attributes are fused together, its power can reach the pinnacle of the universe ruler realm. It can also be considered a rare treasure. You should be able to use it!”<br/><br/>“If you have a treasure in your hands, why don’t we make a trade?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke as he took out the Tai Chi Dragon Disc and flew in his direction.<br/><br/>The distance between them was originally not very far. Now that Wang Xian was flying over, the distance between them was even closer!<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>“This treasure?”<br/><br/>When the light figure saw the tai chi dragon disc in Wang Xian’s hands, he sensed it and revealed a surprised expression.<br/><br/>Their Yin-yang universe only had the attributes of light and darkness.<br/><br/>This Taiji Dragon Disc gave him a very special feeling.<br/><br/>It was a perfect fusion of light and darkness.<br/><br/>Their yin-yang universe also had such a treasure, but it was the first one to be so powerful!<br/><br/>To him, it was also considered a rare treasure!<br/><br/>“It’s indeed a good treasure. I want it!”<br/><br/>The light figure squinted his eyes slightly and said to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>He wanted this treasure!<br/><br/>This could be considered an unexpected gain!<br/><br/>He was smiling in his heart!<br/><br/>“May I know what wood attribute treasure this brother has?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian heard his words and smiled. He continued to get closer to him!<br/><br/>The distance between them was only about 10,000 meters.<br/><br/>This distance was already very close!<br/><br/>“Brother, don’t worry. My treasure is definitely not inferior to yours! ”<br/><br/>When the figure saw Wang Xian approaching, not only did he not notice anything, but the smile on his face became even wider.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was the only one here. At such a close distance, he was able to tie him down even better!<br/><br/>Once he tied him down, when he wanted to take this treasure away, the powerhouses in the Void universe would not say anything!<br/><br/>“Kill!<br/><br/>However, before he could finish his words, Wang Xian let out a low growl!<br/><br/>At this moment, he instantly appeared in front of the light figure.<br/><br/>At the same time, the unicorn bull in the mother nest also charged out immediately!<br/><br/>The Five Elements Millstone also attacked swiftly!<br/><br/>Everything happened in an instant!<br/><br/>Both parties were too close to each other!<br/><br/>He wanted to hold Wang Xian back, but little did he know that Wang Xian already knew his purpose!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
