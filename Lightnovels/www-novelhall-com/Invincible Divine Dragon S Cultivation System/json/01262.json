His expression changed drastically.<br/><br/>He had the thought of retreating.<br/><br/>The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the rest were not people they could fight against!<br/><br/>Now that Duke Xining was dead, he would be crushed quickly.<br/><br/>He could not hold on for long!<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian grabbed Duke Xining’s corpse and threw it in front of the Dragon Palace. He stared at Duke Jin Ming with a grim gaze!<br/><br/>Buzz Buzz<br/><br/>Buzz Buzz<br/><br/>Just as Wang Xian was about to kill him, the emergency communication device in his hand started to vibrate.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw it, he immediately turned it on.<br/><br/>Emergency communication device.<br/><br/>Usually, it would only be triggered when a powerhouse in the origin of Heaven in the nine-origin universe was in a life-and-death situation!<br/><br/>Now that the emergency communication was vibrating, something must have happened!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw the message in the communication device, his gaze froze slightly!<br/><br/>This was a distress signal from the saint’s lineage!<br/><br/>The unity saint was attacked by the King of the Void Universe.<br/><br/>He was no match at all. The entire saint’s lineage had also suffered a tragic attack!<br/><br/>Now, the unity saint was asking them for help!<br/><br/>In the communicator, there were already replies from the heaven origin creation stage powerhouses. They had also suffered an attack from the heaven origin creation stage powerhouses in the Void Universe!<br/><br/>“The capital of the Void dynasty is here? It seems that all the powerhouses in the Void universe are here? Are they courting death?”<br/><br/>Killing intent appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes. Without any hesitation, he instantly arrived at the teleportation formation.<br/><br/>“Green Moon Qilin Ox, I’ll leave this to you guys. I’ll go to the saint’s faction for reinforcements!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian transmitted his voice and disappeared immediately through the teleportation formation!<br/><br/>He left the body of the Void Divine Dragon and the two treasures here.<br/><br/>This was to ensure the safety of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>“All the disciples of the saint’s faction, Run! Run through the teleportation formation! We’re not safe here anymore!”<br/><br/>“Jump! Run! We are not their match at all. This is a great dao level heaven origin creator.”<br/><br/>“It’s a powerhouse from the Void Universe! Run!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian just came out of the teleportation formation, a terrified voice was transmitted into his mind.<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood there and scanned his surroundings.<br/><br/>The mountains and rivers collapsed and countless corpses of the saint lineage’s powerhouses fell to the ground.<br/><br/>More than half of the saint lineage’s domain had turned into a terrifying ruin!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this scene, his expression changed slightly!<br/><br/>The entire saint lineage was actually so tragic!<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>At this moment, in the sky in front of him, a white-robed Hetian saint flew backward heavily.<br/><br/>Streaks of bloody marks appeared on his body.<br/><br/>His entire body was completely cut into countless pieces by the power of space!<br/><br/>From the Void Dynasty’s king to here, in just two minutes, Hetian Saint had already been killed once!<br/><br/>After he was resurrected through the supreme treasure, he immediately rushed over.<br/><br/>In the nine-origin universe, with the help of the universe’s AI, Hetian saint was able to burst out with the strength of a master.<br/><br/>However, there was still a huge gap between the master level and the Great Dao level.<br/><br/>This was especially so when he was facing the king of the Void Universe, the king of the Void dynasty!<br/><br/>An existence that controlled the entire universe!<br/><br/>“If you don’t hand over the universe’s AI, none of You Saints will be able to live!”<br/><br/>The king of the Void dynasty stared at the Hetian saint and said with a face full of killing intent!<br/><br/>In the sky, the Void Pagoda, which was comparable to a beginner-level Tianyuan creator, stood tall!<br/><br/>In front of the Void Pagoda, there was a space disk above the king of Void’s head.<br/><br/>A pair of pale white eyes kept scanning the surroundings, as if they were trying to penetrate the surrounding void to find the location of the universe’s AI!<br/><br/>“In the realm of the 9-essences universe, the living beings of the other universes are forbidden to travel. The intruders will be killed even if they are far away!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at the king of Void with killing intent in his eyes!<br/><br/>He roared and instantly transformed into the body of a divine dragon!<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian let out a dragon roar and instantly appeared beside the Hetian saint.<br/><br/>The pure power of the ancestral tree poured into his body and healed his injuries!<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>“Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The sudden arrival of Wang Xian stunned the Hetian Saint for a moment!<br/><br/>Following that, an excited expression appeared on his face.<br/><br/>Just now, when he sent out a distress signal, there was a reply from the Heaven’s origin creator. They were also under attack.<br/><br/>This made the heart of the Hetian Saint Sink.<br/><br/>He knew that this was a premeditated attack from the void universe.<br/><br/>The other Heaven’s origin creator powerhouses must have been restrained!<br/><br/>The Void Empire wanted to fight for the universe’s artificial intelligence!<br/><br/>Just when he was feeling desperate, the Dragon King had rushed over so quickly!<br/><br/>“Kill the enemy!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded at him and looked at the king of Void. “Let me experience the strength of the king of Void. Roar!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian growled. His dragon horns were towering and two streams of energy attacked the king of Void!<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>When the king of Void saw Wang Xian who had suddenly appeared, his expression changed slightly and his expression darkened!<br/><br/>“You weren’t restrained by my subordinates?”<br/><br/>The king of Void’s expression changed slightly. With a wave of his arm, a scepter appeared in his hand.<br/><br/>With a wave of the scepter, a spatial blade shot towards Wang Xian’s attack.<br/><br/>“With just your two useless subordinates, you dare to attack my Dragon Palace? You want to restrain me too?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at the king of Void and said coldly!<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>As soon as he finished his sentence, the towering energy of the Dragon Horn broke through the spatial blade and continued to attack the King of Void!<br/><br/>The king of Void’s expression instantly turned ugly.<br/><br/>He had yet to obtain the universal AI.<br/><br/>If a Dragon King of the Dragon Palace of the Great Dao level suddenly appeared at this moment, this operation would probably fail!<br/><br/>The probability of him obtaining the universe’s artificial intelligence was infinitely close to zero!<br/><br/>This made him clench his fists tightly as he flew into a rage!<br/><br/>“You’re courting death. You, a newly risen Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, actually dared to provoke me!”<br/><br/>The King of void stared at Wang Xian as he roared with a face full of killing intent.<br/><br/>He raised the scepter in his hand and the space disk above his head began to spin.<br/><br/>A terrifying spatial force began to brew!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, be careful. The space disk above his head is a treasure of Heaven’s origin. Its attack is very strange and can ignore space!”<br/><br/>When the Hetian Sage saw this scene, he immediately reminded Wang Xian!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
