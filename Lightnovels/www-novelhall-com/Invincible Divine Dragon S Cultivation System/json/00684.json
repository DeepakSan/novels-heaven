The Dragon King’s aura was much weaker, and there was a wound on his body from the Lava Space Beast’s Attack!<br/><br/>“Oh? What fast speed. The Dragon King actually killed the lava space beast so quickly? That’s Amazing!”<br/><br/>“The lava space beast was killed by him, but he was also injured. This is a huge opportunity for us!”<br/><br/>“He must have used some powerful trump card. Our Chance is here!”<br/><br/>The experts in the Magic Breaker Circle looked ahead, their eyes filled with joy.<br/><br/>“Attack!”<br/><br/>Jin Yu squinted his eyes slightly and immediately gave the order to attack!<br/><br/>At this moment, the Dragon King was injured. It was the right time for them to attack!<br/><br/>Buzz, Whoosh<br/><br/>Without any hesitation, the Gold Mountain in Jin Yu’s hand flew up. The flowing water on it erupted with golden and blue rays.<br/><br/>A water tornado was formed instantly. In the middle of the water tornado, there was a terrifying gold mountain!<br/><br/>It charged straight at Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“Water demon palm!”<br/><br/>“Celestial Nation, suppress!”<br/><br/>“Godly Tiger Roar, Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>From the left and right, a series of extremely terrifying attacks instantly charged at Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw them charging at him, he pretended to be surprised and growled, “You guys are courting death!”<br/><br/>As he spoke, he did not hesitate at all. He kept the lava space beast and dodged to the back!<br/><br/>“Haha, Are We Courting Death? Dragon King, you are the one who is courting death. Today is the day you die for stealing our Demon Breaker’s Space Beast!”<br/><br/>“Escape? Dragon King, don’t even think about escaping. Didn’t you say that you were going to sweep through our invincible region? Why are you still running away now?”<br/><br/>Seeing Wang Xian instantly hiding behind him to the right, the more than 150 experts in the demon breaker circle revealed excited looks in their eyes.<br/><br/>They roared loudly!<br/><br/>The Dragon King did not fight them and fled immediately. This meant that the Dragon King must have been seriously injured!<br/><br/>Moreover, in order to kill the lava space behemoth, he might have already unleashed a powerful technique.<br/><br/>The current technique could not be used for the time being!<br/><br/>Swoosh<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s figure moved and fled to the back at a rapid speed!<br/><br/>“Give chase!”<br/><br/>The Mad Demon Jin Gui roared loudly and suddenly increased his speed!<br/><br/>As long as he could temporarily restrain the Dragon King, he would be able to surround the Dragon King.<br/><br/>Once he surrounded the dragon king, he had the confidence to suppress it!<br/><br/>“Hehe, we’re here!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued to fly deeper. When he stepped into this territory, a smile appeared on his face!<br/><br/>However, he did not stop. The experts from the demon breaker circle behind him continued to pursue him!<br/><br/>“Wu Sha, lock onto that guy who looks like a bee-man. I want to kill him instantly!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian immediately ordered Wu Sha!<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King. He is Jin Yu, and he is also an expert at the level of a crazy demon. The other water man is a water demon, and he is also a crazy demon. However, that water man is merely a powerful water clone of the water demon!”<br/><br/>Wu Sha’s voice was heard as she spoke to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head slightly.<br/><br/>Wu Sha had already discovered Jin Xu and the water demon when they arrived!<br/><br/>Their arrival must be a conspiracy!<br/><br/>Wang Xian had already made preparations!<br/><br/>One was a mad demon at the peak while the other was a powerful mad demon clone. Furthermore, he could sense that there were two more powerful old monsters among them!<br/><br/>If he could kill one of them in an instant, Wang Xian would be able to capture them all in one go and kill them all!<br/><br/>“The first one, let’s start with that Mad Demon Jin Tao. Let’s see who’s courting death!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian flapped his divine wings. The five elements grinding mill and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate were glowing!<br/><br/>In front of him, the shadows of the Netherworld Ghosts were faintly appearing!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, it’s Here!”<br/><br/>Wu Sha’s voice was heard. At the back, Jin Tao was the fastest. He was the first to step into the area covered by Wu Sha’s spell formation!<br/><br/>At this moment, Wu Sha’s spell formation was fully activated. Her target was Jin Tao, an expert!<br/><br/>Four spell formations, trapping spell formation and killing spell formation, were activated at the same time!<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian’s uninitiated holy wings were flapping violently. The power of wind and thunder was circulating rapidly on it!<br/><br/>He turned around swiftly and his netherspirit avatar appeared on his left and right!<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian let out a low roar and transformed into the body of a divine dragon. The tai chi dragon coiled around him while the five elements millstone hovered above his head!<br/><br/>The figure of the spirit appeared beside Wang Xian as well. Various augmentation abilities landed on Wang Xian’s body!<br/><br/>At this moment, he unleashed all his energy and trump cards!<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>The dragon’s body flickered and disappeared instantly!<br/><br/>“Not good!”<br/><br/>“Not good, there’s an ambush!”<br/><br/>When Jin Tao sensed the energy of the formation around him, he suddenly had a bad premonition!<br/><br/>Especially when he sensed the huge change in the Dragon King’s aura in front of him, his expression changed drastically!<br/><br/>He waved his arm and the Golden Mountain flew towards him. In an instant, it arrived above his head.<br/><br/>Golden light enveloped the water and poured down!<br/><br/>He was in the middle and was completely enveloped by the golden light and water!<br/><br/>“What terrifying speed. This Dragon King doesn’t seem to be injured at all. Could it be that he already knew about our attack in advance? What’s with this array formation?”<br/><br/>At this moment, many doubts surged in his heart!<br/><br/>“Not good, there’s an ambush. It’s an array formation!”<br/><br/>At the rear, more than 150 experts saw the sudden surge of power, and their expressions were stunned as they roared loudly!<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>At the instant they discovered it, the terrifying four formations had already fallen towards Jin Yu!<br/><br/>Crazy Demon Jin Yu’s strength was very strong.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, he was facing the invincible region’s strongest magus, the old witch.<br/><br/>Under her unprepared attacks, he could only use his innate supreme treasure to block!<br/><br/>However, he was caught off guard by the old witch’s well-prepared attack. The terrifying formation landed on top of it, causing the entire innate supreme treasure golden mountain to tremble violently!<br/><br/>The flow of water on top of it also stopped instantly!<br/><br/>The huge Golden Mountain flew backward!<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian appeared in front of him!<br/><br/>The terrifying five elements millstone came to the top of his head. The five divine dragons revolved rapidly, and streams of destructive power of the five elements charged at him!<br/><br/>The power of the Tai Chi Dragon, coiling light and dark divine dragons, covered the dragon’s claws and clawed at him rapidly!<br/><br/>Four netherspirit avatars were also charging at him from the left and right!<br/><br/>“No, no, no!”<br/><br/>Crazy Demon Jin Yan looked at this incomparably terrifying attack and his body trembled violently.<br/><br/>If the attack of the formation caught him off guard and was enough to injure him!<br/><br/>That Wang Xian’s attack, already can make him fatal!<br/><br/>He could clearly sense the threat of death, the deadly attack!<br/><br/>“Poof!”<br/><br/>However, with the speed of Wang Xian, he simply can not resist!<br/><br/>The destructive power of the five elements penetrated his body, the dragon claw directly in the hand!<br/><br/>Twinkle!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
