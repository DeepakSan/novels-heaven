I hope brother Wang Xian and senior brother Junzi can break through to the universe knight realm as soon as possible!”<br/><br/>“Come, come, Cheers. Thank you again, junior brother Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>On a ship in the Milky Way, the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect raised their wine glasses happily and cheered loudly.<br/><br/>The harvest this time was incomparably huge for everyone.<br/><br/>Each person had four battle angels of the same level, one person had two weapons, and there were other harvests. This made each of them extremely rich.<br/><br/>At least for the next ten thousand years, they would not lack resources.<br/><br/>Especially senior brother Junzi and that female disciple who had obtained the crescent moon key, their harvest was even greater.<br/><br/>Senior Brother Junzi had found the path of a supremacy, and the female disciple also knew that she had a high chance of breaking through to the supremacy in the future.<br/><br/>This made them extremely excited.<br/><br/>“Junior brother Wang Xian, on behalf of the unspecialized disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect, I would like to thank you once again for your help and your generosity!”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Junzi also expressed his gratitude with a face full of excitement.<br/><br/>“Haha, everyone is too polite.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and shook his head. He raised his wine glass.<br/><br/>Everyone was chatting happily on the ship. Senior Brother Kong, senior brother Xu, and the rest came to Wang Xian’s side with a hint of respect and toasted him.<br/><br/>Wang Xian agreed to them one by one.<br/><br/>Time passed little by little. After more than two hours of celebration, everyone dispersed and sat around the ship.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and Mo Xinlu sat in front of the deck and listened to her talking about the willow deity Daoist sect with a smile.<br/><br/>“Junior Brother Kong, junior brother Xu.”<br/><br/>However, at this moment, at the back of the ship, senior brother Lu and the elders from the same clan walked towards them and greeted them with a smile.<br/><br/>“Senior brother Lu.”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Kong and senior brother Xu looked at them with a smile on their faces.<br/><br/>“Senior brother Lu, I noticed that both of you were a little unhappy just now. Please feel sorry for us. If senior brother has any needs in the future, please let us know.”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Kong continued to say.<br/><br/>“Don’t worry, I won’t be polite to the two of you.”<br/><br/>Senior brother Lu smiled and looked around, he placed his hands on the deck and said, “It’s not only Lao Yue’s death that made me unhappy. Junior brothers, don’t you think that Wang Xian has gone too far? He has gained so much this time. How much did he give us? It doesn’t even count as soup, right?”<br/><br/>“This…”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Kong and senior brother Xu opened their mouths slightly when they heard his words, after pondering for a moment, they said, “Senior brother Lu, Wang Xian’s strength is just there. He deserves to be able to obtain so many treasures. If it weren’t for them, we might have encountered some trouble.”<br/><br/>“He has obtained more than 10,000 battle angels, more than 1,000 divine weapons and acquired Numinous Treasures. How much do we have?”<br/><br/>“And that powerful fruit. He must have obtained it from the fourth level. This is a treasure that can allow one to break through to a universe knight.”<br/><br/>Senior brother Lu frowned slightly when he heard his words. His expression changed as he continued to speak.<br/><br/>His words made senior brother Kong and senior brother Xu fall silent.<br/><br/>Weren’t they envious?<br/><br/>They weren’t greedy, right?<br/><br/>But they knew that there were some things that they couldn’t do!<br/><br/>Furthermore, Wang Xian’s strength was too terrifying.<br/><br/>“Senior brother Lu, do you want to have a drink?”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Kong and senior brother Xu exchanged glances and changed the topic.<br/><br/>“There’s no need!”<br/><br/>Senior brother Lu understood what they meant. He shook his head, turned around and left expressionlessly.<br/><br/>“Senior brother Lu has changed!”<br/><br/>Looking at senior brother Lu’s background, senior brother Xu Sighed and whispered.<br/><br/>“Maybe it’s because of his race. He needs to think more about it!”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Kong shook his head.<br/><br/>“Old Lu, we…”<br/><br/>Senior brother Lu and the others left. The old man at the side opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but he stopped himself.<br/><br/>“I know a friend of the dragon race. I want to make a deal with them!”<br/><br/>Senior brother Lu’s eyes flashed with a cold luster.<br/><br/>“HMM? Okay!”<br/><br/>The old man nodded his head and looked at the front of the ship with a cold gaze.<br/><br/>The ship was traveling at a fast speed. It would take at least five days to reach the willow deity Daoist sect from here.<br/><br/>Wang Xian came to a room on the ship and took out a treasure.<br/><br/>The acquired Numinous Treasure, the crescent moon, shone in the sky.<br/><br/>This was Venerable Crescent Moon’s famous Numinous Treasure. It had a powerful detection ability.<br/><br/>He sensed it and probed the way it was controlled.<br/><br/>At the next moment, his figure came to the sky above the ship. The crescent moon was suspended in the sky and a weak ray of light dispersed in the surroundings.<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood below the crescent moon and waited quietly.<br/><br/>Very soon, images appeared in front of him.<br/><br/>The images were of the ocean surrounding the Milky Way. There were all kinds of desolate beasts in the water below the ocean.<br/><br/>His mind moved and his gaze landed on a dire beast. The image in front of him enlarged. It was as if he had arrived in front of the dire beast. He could sense the strength and aura of the dire beast.<br/><br/>“This is? What a powerful probing force!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian opened his mouth slightly. A shocked expression appeared on his face.<br/><br/>“Let’s see what his limit is!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian focused his gaze and the crescent moon flew up into the sky.<br/><br/>He stared at the scene in front of him and sensed it with his mind.<br/><br/>“A radius of 100 billion kilometers. I haven’t completely refined it yet, but it can cover 100 billion kilometers. This crescent moon illumination is really terrifying.”<br/><br/>Very soon, Wang Xian smacked his tongue, and his eyes flickered.<br/><br/>If he completely refined it, the range of coverage could reach at least 500 to 600 billion kilometers.<br/><br/>Within this range, he could detect any living thing.<br/><br/>“Back then, the Crescent Moon Ravine of the Crescent Moon Venerable was built on selling all kinds of information. With such a treasure, I can obtain a lot of information.”<br/><br/>“When I was suppressing the blazing turtle winged beast, if I had the crescent moon illumination in the sky, I would definitely be able to subdue it.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled.<br/><br/>The crescent moon illumination was a treasure of the light attribute. The five elements grinding could not absorb it.<br/><br/>Wang Xian possessed the light attribute and could completely refine it.<br/><br/>With a wave of his arm, he kept the crescent moon illumination. With a move of his body, he immediately flew into the room of the ship.<br/><br/>Next, he wanted to completely refine this spiritual treasure.<br/><br/>After refining it, he would go to the volcano region to see if he could find the blazing turtle winged beast.<br/><br/>Just as Wang Xian was refining the crescent moon illumination, a figure flew out from the land of the dragon race.<br/><br/>The figure had the picture of a divine dragon on his face, making him look extremely ferocious.<br/><br/>His speed was extremely terrifying. As he flew, a phantom image of a desolate beast appeared beneath him.<br/><br/>The target was deep in the Milky Way.<br/><br/>“The transaction has been completed. A supremacy from the dragon race is rushing over here!”<br/><br/>“Supremacy, no matter how strong that Wang Xian is, he can’t escape from the hands of a supremacy, let alone a universe knight who is fully confident.”<br/><br/>In a room on the ship, senior brother Lu and the old man beside him had cold expressions on their faces. Their eyes were flashing with killing intent.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
