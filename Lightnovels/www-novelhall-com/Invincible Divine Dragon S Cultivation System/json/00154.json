To be able to withstand my strength, this is definitely not the doing of the Dragon tribe leader. It seems like this ya long has been imprisoned for a long time.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled to himself. His body moved and he immediately arrived at the end of the chains.<br/><br/>This was an acquired Numinous Treasure of the Earth attribute. It contained a powerful force.<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements Millstone appeared. Waves of energy landed on the chains.<br/><br/>“Hualala!”<br/><br/>The chain instinctively resisted. However, without anyone controlling the chain, even a powerful acquired Numinous Treasure would not be able to withstand the attack of the five elements millstone.<br/><br/>The chain contracted little by Little and let out a terrifying sound.<br/><br/>“This time, I have obtained a few acquired Numinous Treasures. After the five elements millstone devours them, I should be able to undergo an upgrade.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the chain and smiled.<br/><br/>After the Five Elements Millstone was upgraded again, it would have the power to kill a level two universe knight.<br/><br/>He looked at the Asian Dragon. The chain moved away from his body, but the marks left on his body did not recover.<br/><br/>The entire Asian Dragon’s body trembled. There was no movement at all.<br/><br/>“What a pity.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head. With a move of his palm, waves of dragon energy were transmitted into his body. At the same time, some dragon blood entered his body directly.<br/><br/>Thump! Thump! Thump<br/><br/>As the Dragon Energy and dragon blood were injected into his body, the heartbeat of the Asian Dragon became more and more intense.<br/><br/>As a large amount of dragon blood entered his body, the injuries on his body began to recover.<br/><br/>Traces of lightning appeared on his body.<br/><br/>The head buried in his body slowly raised its head. At this moment, Wang Xian finally saw his true face clearly.<br/><br/>It was a dragon head that looked a little frail and aged. It had a pair of dragon horns.<br/><br/>Purple Lightning sparkled on the dragon horns.<br/><br/>“Dragon Blood… Thank you…”<br/><br/>He seemed to have not spoken for a very long time. He opened his dragon mouth and spoke four words at a loss.<br/><br/>“I am a member of the Divine Dragon lineage. You can call me the Dragon King.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at him as he spoke. He poured a large amount of dragon blood onto his body once again.<br/><br/>The vitality in his body grew stronger.<br/><br/>His turbid gaze slowly became clear.<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>He let out a low groan. Five minutes later, he transformed into the appearance of an old man.<br/><br/>“Thank you… Benefactor!”<br/><br/>He opened his mouth and knelt on the ground as though he was still not used to speaking.<br/><br/>“Get up. We are both from the divine dragon lineage. We should help each other. You should join our Dragon Palace in the future.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at him and said faintly.<br/><br/>“Yes, benefactor!”<br/><br/>The elder nodded and stood up slowly.<br/><br/>“How long have you been imprisoned here?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked him curiously.<br/><br/>“I don’t know. 300 million years? 400 million years? I can’t remember clearly.”<br/><br/>The old man shook his head. A look of reminiscence appeared in his eyes. “Back then, I obtained some Thunder Treasures and was pursued by an expert. After i escaped, I was suppressed by a human and was imprisoned in this dark place.”<br/><br/>“He took my dragon scales and Dragon Blood. Later on, he seemed to have established a race called the dragon descendant race. Hehe, they were all experts nurtured by my blood.”<br/><br/>The old man said bitterly and shook his head.<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>Upon hearing his words, Wang Xian was slightly shocked. Didn’t that mean that he had been imprisoned for more than two billion years?<br/><br/>“Thunder Treasure? Is this what you mean by Thunder Treasure?”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian took out a thunder attribute holy feather and said to the old man.<br/><br/>“Yes, this is it.”<br/><br/>The old man nodded his head. “This is a small portion of a powerful holy item. Back then, I obtained 22 of them.”<br/><br/>“Only 22?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian frowned slightly. After eliminating the Dragon tribe leader, the number of thunder-attributed holy feathers in his hands had indeed reached 22.<br/><br/>However, there were still 27 more to go before he could gather all of them.<br/><br/>“The remaining thunder feathers are on a powerhouse in the heaven-splitting chaotic land.”<br/><br/>The old man nodded his head.<br/><br/>“Heaven splitting chaotic land!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s pupils constricted slightly when he heard the name.<br/><br/>Legend had it that the heaven splitting chaotic land was the first continent in the universe. It was also the place where the first living beings were born.<br/><br/>That piece of land was incomparably vast. If one wanted to establish a foothold on that piece of land, one had to possess the strength of an intermediate race in the universe.<br/><br/>Many intermediate races in the universe were not even qualified to establish a race there.<br/><br/>“What realm were you at back then?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued to ask him.<br/><br/>“Benefactor, I was at the third level of a universe knight back then. I was able to fight two levels higher and fight against a level five universe Knight.”<br/><br/>The old man said.<br/><br/>“Oh? With such strength, I would be considered one of the top even among the dragon species.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows.<br/><br/>“Benefactor, you know about the dragon species? Yes, my bloodline has unexpectedly reverted back to its original form.”<br/><br/>The old man nodded.<br/><br/>“Perhaps, you can evolve into a lightning dragon.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian glanced at the old man and said faintly.<br/><br/>“It’s good that I can live freely. I don’t need anything else. My lifespan is not long.”<br/><br/>The old man’s eyes dimmed. Even though he was powerful and possessed a powerful bloodline, he had lived for too long.<br/><br/>He had been alive for far too long.<br/><br/>So long that he was about to rot.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, it’s almost time to deal with the outside world.”<br/><br/>At this moment, Prime Minister Gui and the rest walked over and reported to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui and the rest looked at the old man with a look of surprise.<br/><br/>The old man looked at Prime Minister Gui and the rest with a hint of surprise.<br/><br/>What a pure divine dragon bloodline.<br/><br/>“This is an inferior dragon who was imprisoned here by the first generation leader of the Dragon Race.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian introduced him to Prime Minister Gui.<br/><br/>“Lei Ming!”<br/><br/>The old man introduced himself.<br/><br/>“Hello, I am Prime Minister Gui of the Dragon Palace. These are the leaders of the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui nodded his head.<br/><br/>“Lei Ming will be a member of the Dragon Palace from now on. Let’s go back after settling this matter.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to them.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui and the rest nodded.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest flew out of the treasury. They swept their gaze across the surroundings before they retrieved the five elements millstone and returned with Lei Ming.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>After returning to the Dragon Palace, Lei Ming looked around in astonishment. From his senses, all the members in the Dragon Palace possessed a powerful divine dragon bloodline.<br/><br/>Many of the bloodlines were even purer than when he was at his peak.<br/><br/>What kind of concept was this?<br/><br/>Those whose bloodline was purer than his were comparable to a genuine purebred divine dragon.<br/><br/>“Prime Minister Gui, Tally up all the gains and bring all the treasures over.”<br/><br/>When he arrived at the Dragon King’s Hall, Wang Xian sat on the dragon throne and ordered immediately.<br/><br/>This time, he had obtained a large amount of resources from the treasure vault of the dragon race.<br/><br/>The dragon race leaders also had a large amount of treasures in their divine realms.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
