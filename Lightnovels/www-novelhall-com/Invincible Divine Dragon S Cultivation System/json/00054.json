All the aquatic creatures in the entire area were attracted.<br/><br/>Sensing the aquatic desolate beasts below locking onto the arowana and sensing the strength of the aquatic desolate beasts, he revealed a smile.<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>The surface of the sea began to change. The originally turbulent sea water became even more violent.<br/><br/>The five elements grinding was like a weak sailboat. It was obvious that it could be overturned at any moment.<br/><br/>From the bottom of the Milky Way, waves of terrifying aura could be felt.<br/><br/>“Brother Wang, what happened?”<br/><br/>Mi Xin Lu sensed the changes in the surrounding seawater and revealed a terrified expression.<br/><br/>The terrifying aura below made her scalp tingle.<br/><br/>“I’m about to reap the rewards!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian revealed a faint smile.<br/><br/>He placed both his hands on the five elements Millstone and waves of energy surged crazily into the five elements millstone.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the energy transformed into chains. The chains were of various colors and extended downwards.<br/><br/>Countless chains were like a huge fishing net that was thrown downwards.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a terrifying roar and attack came from below.<br/><br/>Within a radius of a few hundred million kilometers from Wang Xian and the rest, huge waves were set off.<br/><br/>The huge waves shot up into the sky for a million kilometers.<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood on the five elements grinding mill and revealed a faint smile on his face.<br/><br/>Mi Xin Lu, who was at the side, watched this scene in a daze.<br/><br/>He could sense that there were more than ten thousand aquatic creatures below.<br/><br/>The weaker aquatic creatures were only at the godly monarch realm while the stronger ones had already reached the eighth level of the godly monarch realm.<br/><br/>That Aura made her heart palpitate.<br/><br/>However, there were chains around all the aquatic creatures. The chains formed a huge net that covered the sky and swept towards them.<br/><br/>It was like a fishing net that wanted to scoop them all up.<br/><br/>This…<br/><br/>Mi Xin Lu stared at them with her eyes wide open.<br/><br/>“Dragon Eye Lock on all corners, Lock!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes emitted a terrifying pressure as he locked onto the aquatic dire beasts that wanted to escape back to their lair.<br/><br/>“Hualala!”<br/><br/>The chains were like dragon pythons as they coiled around all the aquatic creatures.<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>“Ji Ji!”<br/><br/>A terrified cry came from below as Wang Xian waved his arm.<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>In an instant, more than 10,000 aquatic creatures were thrown out of the bottom of the sea and floated on the surface of the sea.<br/><br/>The largest one was more than 10,000 meters in size.<br/><br/>“The harvest is not bad. There’s one level eight celestial emperor, three level seven celestial emperor, and more than 100 celestial emperor-level creatures.”<br/><br/>“The rest are all celestial emperor-level creatures.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze across and revealed a smile on his face.<br/><br/>He had easily harvested so many dire beasts. This was even more convenient than entering the Milky Way.<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian opened his mouth and let out a dragon roar. One after another, celestial emperor-level aquatic creatures flew directly into his mouth.<br/><br/>All the aquatic creatures below celestial emperor level entered his stomach and turned into dragon energy.<br/><br/>To the current him, there were only a few of them.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Following that, he unleashed his dragon energy. All the celestial emperor level one and level two dire beasts trembled and let out a low roar. They flew towards Wang Xian and laid on the ground, not daring to move.<br/><br/>“If I sell them as war pets, I can increase the resources by ten times.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at these celestial emperor level water race dire beasts and revealed a smile.<br/><br/>He devoured these dire beasts directly. Compared to taming and selling them, the difference in resources was ten times.<br/><br/>Naturally, he had to tame these celestial emperor level dire beasts and sell them.<br/><br/>The reason why he called Mi Xin Lu over was to get her to help with the publicity.<br/><br/>“Brother Wang, the Divine Dragon bloodline in your body is so strong. Legend has it that a real divine dragon can rule the water race. Brother Wang, are you a real water race?”<br/><br/>Mi Xinlu looked at the scene in front of him in disbelief and asked in shock.<br/><br/>“Yes, you can follow me in the future. I will give you some dragon blood to consume. In the future, I will help you evolve into a powerful dragon.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not hide anything. A ball of dragon blood floated in front of Mi Xinlu. He smiled and said directly, “Also, I will give you one thing. I want to tame these desolate beasts. You can advertise it on the universe’s AI and sell it!”<br/><br/>Mi Xin Lu sensed the energy in the dragon blood and felt that the bloodline in her body was fearful. She nodded immediately and said, “Alright, brother Wang.”<br/><br/>She stretched out her hand and took the ball of dragon blood. Her body trembled as she opened her mouth and swallowed it.<br/><br/>A warm and mellow bloodline power entered her body.<br/><br/>A trace of the Divine Dragon bloodline in her body seemed to be activated as it was absorbed crazily.<br/><br/>Wang Xian took a glance at her and revealed a faint smile on his face.<br/><br/>Giving her this lump of dragon blood was also to prevent her from revealing certain things. With this lump of dragon blood, Wang Xian would be able to grasp all the situation of the Mi Xin deer.<br/><br/>There were some things that he had to be on guard against.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this dragon blood was a great opportunity for her.<br/><br/>“You can focus on absorbing the dragon blood first.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to her. Then, he moved and arrived at the level eight celestial thearch level water race desolate beast.<br/><br/>This was a level eight celestial thearch level water race desolate beast. It was similar to a shark, but it looked much more terrifying than a shark.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it possessed a terrifying divine dragon with laws. It could easily destroy a star.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was not unfamiliar with beast taming techniques, even though this desolate beast had the strength of a level eight celestial thearch.<br/><br/>However, it would still take some time to tame these desolate beasts.<br/><br/>However, compared to the speed of other people’s Beast Taming, Wang Xian’s speed was definitely tens of thousands of times that of an ordinary Beast Tamer.<br/><br/>Celestial Emperor Hong Tian, who was at the peak of the Celestial Emperor Realm, took a thousand years to tame an eighth level Celestial Emperor War Pet. However, he only needed one day.<br/><br/>After ten consecutive days, Wang Xian had tamed all the desolate beasts.<br/><br/>At the side, the bloodline upgrade of the Mi Xin deer had already ended.<br/><br/>She sat at the side with a face full of excitement as she watched Wang Xian taming the war pet. With the universe artificial intelligence in her hand, she took photos and videos one after another.<br/><br/>After taming the desolate beasts, Wang Xian was ready to sell them as soon as possible.<br/><br/>“How is it going?”<br/><br/>After taming the last one, Wang Xian looked at the Mi Xin deer and asked her.<br/><br/>“Brother Wang, many people are asking how we can get our war pets. Many people want to buy them, and there are even people who are willing to pay a high price for them!”<br/><br/>Mi Xin Lu said excitedly.<br/><br/>“Hehe, reply me. The sale will take place in two months. We will inform you about how and where to sell the war pets!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian squinted his eyes and said happily.<br/><br/>It seemed like he had to start his old job.<br/><br/>By selling his war pets, he could use a large number of war pets to collect resources and increase his strength rapidly.<br/><br/>If he was lucky, his strength would increase after selling all his war pets in two months.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
