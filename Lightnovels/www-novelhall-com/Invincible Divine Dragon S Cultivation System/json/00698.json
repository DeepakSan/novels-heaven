What a terrifying existence this was!<br/><br/>They were almost 100% certain that the Divine Dragon Clan would rise once again in the future!<br/><br/>At this moment, they had the fighting spirit to follow the Dragon King in front of them and create the peak together!<br/><br/>“Phew!”<br/><br/>“Another breakthrough!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian opened his eyes and smiled.<br/><br/>Name: Wang Xian<br/><br/>Race: Yin-yang, wind-thunder, five elements divine dragon (man-dragon unity)<br/><br/>Level: Universe Knight Level 8(the ninth form of the Divine Dragon Transformation)<br/><br/>Origin: 1% (99% needed for the next breakthrough)<br/><br/>Ability: ruling the water race (ruling the water race below one’s level)<br/><br/>Devouring living beings (devouring living beings to extract origin)<br/><br/>Control of the five elements<br/><br/>Technique: Dragon God transformation<br/><br/>Ability: soul capturing, spirit attaching<br/><br/>Law Ability: Dragon Eye Lock, Five Elements Dragon Claw, Yin-yang breakthrough, eight luminaries Dragon Scale, Holy Dragon Shadow, Heavenly Dragon Eight Tribes, Dragon Tomb, Cloud Dragon Soaring, True Dragon body<br/><br/>Law form: eight Dragon Pillars, eight dragon clones, towering Dragon Horns, Mighty Heavenly Dragon, God Tail Pearl, Life Dragon Breath, Shadow Dragon Clone, Nether Dragon chasing!<br/><br/>Control Law: metal, wood, water, fire, Earth, light, dark wind and thunder<br/><br/>God Country: Dragon Palace<br/><br/>Dragon Palace: Innate.<br/><br/>Dragon Palace member: 7960450<br/><br/>Sensing his attributes, a smile appeared on his face!<br/><br/>A universe knight at level eight was comparable to a universe master at level two!<br/><br/>Invincible, this strength was simply invincible!<br/><br/>Without a master, Wang Xian could be invincible in the universe!<br/><br/>Of course, he was equally invincible before his breakthrough!<br/><br/>Now, he was even more terrifying!<br/><br/>If it was said that before his breakthrough, he could fight against four to five mad demons by himself, then now, he could kill four to five mad demons in an instant!<br/><br/>In front of him, mad demons were an existence that could be killed easily!<br/><br/>Wang Xian could kill even a real level two master of the universe!<br/><br/>This was his current strength!<br/><br/>“It’s a pity that it will be difficult for the five elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate to break through again!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian felt his own strength and thought to himself!<br/><br/>Wang Xian had yet to find a way to improve the five elements millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate!<br/><br/>In the past, the Five Elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate would be sufficient to absorb the innate spiritual treasure.<br/><br/>However, the effect of absorbing the innate numinous treasure was negligible now.<br/><br/>As for the innate numinous treasure, he could not do it now!<br/><br/>That was because the innate numinous treasure was extremely sturdy and could not be destroyed!<br/><br/>Moreover, the innate numinous treasure had a special characteristic. The stronger the strong one was, the stronger the power they could unleash!<br/><br/>Currently, the Five Elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Disc in Wang Xian’s hands were only slightly stronger than ordinary innate numinous treasures!<br/><br/>However, he could not achieve that. The strength of an innate treasure was comparable to Wang Xian’s own strength!<br/><br/>“We can consider the matter of the Five Elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate in the future. Now, we should continue to consume the eternal embryo fruit and sweep across the Invincible Region!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he scanned his surroundings!<br/><br/>“Congratulations, Dragon King, for your breakthrough. In the future, you will definitely be able to lead the Dragon Palace to lead the Divine Dragon clan back to their peak!”<br/><br/>Wu Sha and the rest immediately bowed respectfully when they felt Wang Xian’s imposing gaze!<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and waved at them!<br/><br/>“I have a mission for all of you. The seven of you will go to the territory of the desolate beasts and space beasts and kill them all. Collect all the corpses, their lairs, and all the treasures and place them in the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian instructed them!<br/><br/>“Also, bring the five elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate!”<br/><br/>As he spoke, the Five Elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate flew to Wu Sha’s side!<br/><br/>After subduing the seven mad demons, with Wu Sha and the Rest’s strength, together with the Tai Chi Dragon Plate and the five elements millstone, they would be able to wipe out the entire invincible region!<br/><br/>Killing the desolate beasts and space behemoths in the invincible region would not be a problem if they worked together!<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King. We promise to complete your mission!”<br/><br/>Wu Sha and the rest said respectfully!<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.<br/><br/>He would leave this mission to them while Wang Xian could continue to sell the fruits in the trading ground!<br/><br/>He still had more than a thousand fruits in his hands. He was ready to sell them all!<br/><br/>Wu Sha and the other seven crazy demons left immediately after receiving the mission. Wang Xian flew towards the trading ground as well!<br/><br/>This breakthrough gave him a terrifying increase in speed!<br/><br/>It was comparable to the speed of a level three universe overlord!<br/><br/>With such speed, the powerhouses in the invincible zone could no longer see his figure!<br/><br/>Only those at the level of mad demons could see his figure!<br/><br/>However, how many mad demons were there in the Invincible Zone Now?<br/><br/>Even if they were hidden, there wouldn’t be more than five of them!<br/><br/>That was because on the surface of the invincible zone, there were only about ten mad demons!<br/><br/>Seven of them were already his subordinates!<br/><br/>While flying in the air, Wang Xian took out the universal AI and immediately posted a message!<br/><br/>“One day later, I will sell a large number of ordinary fruits in the trading ground at the same price as before.”<br/><br/>After the information was released, he continued flying!<br/><br/>When the news of Wang Xian was released, it instantly attracted a lot of attention in the Invincible Zone!<br/><br/>Now, after the news of Jin Xu going crazy, a large number of powerhouses immediately contacted the Dragon King and wanted to buy the fruits!<br/><br/>However, they did not receive any reply!<br/><br/>Now that the Dragon King was going to sell them again, the group of powerhouses revealed excited expressions and immediately rushed to the trading ground!<br/><br/>“The Dragon King has finally appeared. This time, I must buy a large number of ordinary fruit!”<br/><br/>“I don’t know how many ordinary fruit I can consume to achieve a breakthrough. If I need too many, I might not be able to afford them!”<br/><br/>“The Dragon King really has a lot of ordinary fruit. He has sold over a thousand of them, right?”<br/><br/>In the invincible region, the old monsters were discussing.<br/><br/>“Eh? We just found the Dragon King’s location, and he left again? The trading ground?”<br/><br/>At the same time, more than a dozen angels flew over from the right side of the ancient void God kingdom, frowning slightly!<br/><br/>“Hehe, it’s even better to go to the trading ground. Let’s go, we’re going as well. All the experts in the invincible zone are looking for the Dragon King. I heard that some top-tier experts are already heading toward the trading ground!”<br/><br/>An angel said!<br/><br/>“The third prince has sent US News. He wants us to finish it as soon as possible. We can’t delay any longer.”<br/><br/>An angel in the center said!<br/><br/>“The strength that the Dragon King has shown is too strong. Send a reply to the third prince. We don’t have 100% confidence to kill him. We need to act according to the situation!”<br/><br/>An angel frowned and looked at the angel in the middle!<br/><br/>“I know. If the old witch really died at the hands of the Dragon King, we really don’t have a 100% chance of killing her!”<br/><br/>The angel nodded and replied, “I have already reported it to the third prince. The chance of killing her is only 80% !”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
