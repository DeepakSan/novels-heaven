Once you look at it, you will suffer an even more terrifying attack.<br/><br/>It could be said that every move of the charm dragon could carry out strange attacks on you.<br/><br/>“It’s really powerful and strange. The ancestral witches in the universe are all incredible existences.”<br/><br/>Tian Chen, who was watching from the side, was full of admiration as he watched the charm dragon hide its attack methods.<br/><br/>He was only a small array master back then, and his ultimate target was also the ancestral witch.<br/><br/>However, when he saw the charm dragon, a dragon that had inherited some of the abilities of the ancestral wizard, his heart was filled with envy.<br/><br/>However, his path of witchcraft and the charm dragon were two different paths.<br/><br/>He focused on formations.<br/><br/>His path was even further than the charm dragon.<br/><br/>However, if he wanted to go further, he would have to pay a lot more than the charm dragon.<br/><br/>“Very good, very good. Even if there are only a thousand charm dragons, when all of them have reached the level of the ancestral wizard, it would be terrifying to imagine them standing together.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s face was full of smiles.<br/><br/>Once the charm dragons reached their peak, they would definitely be extremely terrifying.<br/><br/>As for the Dolphins, they could also evolve into the charm dragons. Although there were a few of them, they were more powerful than before.<br/><br/>Especially during this period of time, the black spider lilies grew again. When they grew to more than 1,000.<br/><br/>The Charm Dragon and the spider Lily would have an even more terrifying attack.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, Can I. . . Can I evolve into such a charm dragon? Can I?”<br/><br/>At the side, the female snake was swaying her body as she asked with excitement and anticipation.<br/><br/>“If you are willing to join the Dragon Palace, you can evolve into a Charm Dragon!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at her and nodded.<br/><br/>If not for her inspiration, Wang Xian might not have thought of such a method.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the female snake’s bloodline was not bad to begin with. Naturally, she would be welcomed to join the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Sure! Sure!”<br/><br/>The goddess did not hesitate and nodded her head immediately.<br/><br/>“Once you enter the Dragon Transformation Pool, you can undergo the transformation directly.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to her.<br/><br/>The female snake did not hesitate and jumped into the pool directly.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I will choose a group of dolphins to enter the Dragon Transformation Pool.”<br/><br/>The leader of the Dolphins spoke from the side.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded immediately.<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a low roar came from the depths of the dragon transformation pool.<br/><br/>The current dragon transformation pool was filled with dragon blood.<br/><br/>With dragon blood that was hundreds of kilometers deep, it was impossible to see the deepest part of the pool.<br/><br/>However, at this moment, rays of golden light were emitted from the deepest part of the pool.<br/><br/>Wang Xian immediately looked over and narrowed his eyes slightly.<br/><br/>With a thought, he waved his arm and threw two golden dragon pearls directly toward the center.<br/><br/>The Golden Dragon Pearls entered the pool and immediately fell toward the lower part of the pool.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>Deep in the dragon transformation pool, the roars of the divine dragon could be heard.<br/><br/>“There are more than ten dragon bones, two Golden Dragon Balls, and the Dragon Soul of the Tianhai Dragon King. Hopefully, a golden dragon will be born and this golden dragon will be more powerful.”<br/><br/>He mumbled.<br/><br/>The improvement of the Golden Dragon continued.<br/><br/>Wang Xian waited for a while before returning.<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. The other members of the Dragon Palace also began to improve.<br/><br/>The Heaven Formation also entered the dragon transformation pool.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>On the fifth day, an awe-inspiring roar came from the dragon transformation pool.<br/><br/>A golden light flashed across the entire Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Wang Xian, who was in the Dragon King’s bedroom, sensed the situation in the dragon transformation pool. His eyes were filled with excitement.<br/><br/>His body moved and he immediately appeared in front of the dragon transformation pool.<br/><br/>In the sky above the dragon transformation pool, a golden dragon that was about 40,000 meters long was circling in the sky. A powerful pressure came from his dragon body.<br/><br/>“The power of a universe knight at level four.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed his power and a glint flashed across his eyes.<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>The Golden Dragon swayed. He looked at Wang Xian and flew straight over.<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The Golden Dragon turned into a middle-aged man and half-knelt in front of Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Very good. I’ll call you ao Jin from now on!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at him and said with a smile.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Ao Jin replied immediately.<br/><br/>“Do you have any memories?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at him and asked.<br/><br/>Ao Jin was mainly born with the Dragon Soul of the Tianhai Dragon King. However, he did not know if he had any memories that belonged to him.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I was separated from the body of the Tianhai Dragon King. I have inherited all the memories of the Tianhai Dragon King.”<br/><br/>Ao Jin immediately reported.<br/><br/>“That’s good.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and asked, “Do you have any control over the Dragon Palace of the Sky Sea Dragon King?”<br/><br/>“Yes. The Sky Sea Dragon King only has the other half of his dragon soul left. If he doesn’t have a body, I can easily take over the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Ao Jin nodded.<br/><br/>“Oh? Then I can make a trip there after a period of time and occupy the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said.<br/><br/>The Sky Sea Dragon Palace could be said to be a huge resource. Not to mention the treasures in the Dragon King Palace, just the Sky Sea Dragon Palace alone could be upgraded to a level six or seven universe knight if it was devoured by Ao crab and the others.<br/><br/>“What was the realm of the Sky Sea Dragon King when he was at his peak?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked.<br/><br/>“His combat strength was at level nine universe knight, and his realm was at level six universe Knight!”<br/><br/>Ao Jin immediately said.<br/><br/>“Universe Knight Level Nine Combat Strength?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. Such strength was not weak.<br/><br/>Of course, for the Divine Dragon Clan at their peak, it could only be said to be passable.<br/><br/>The powerful divine dragons of the peak clan were all terrifying existences at the level of universe masters.<br/><br/>They occupied more than half of the ocean of the heaven opening primal continent.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I think it’s best for us to make a trip to the Sky Sea Dragon Palace as soon as possible. There’s an acquired Supreme Treasure in the Sky Sea Dragon Palace. It’s very powerful.”<br/><br/>Ao Jin suddenly suggested.<br/><br/>“Acquired Supreme Treasure?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he heard his words.<br/><br/>Powerful treasures in the universe were divided into acquired Supreme Treasures, acquired Supreme Treasures, and then innate treasures.<br/><br/>Acquired Supreme Treasures were definitely the most powerful treasures among the universe knights.<br/><br/>With an acquired Supreme Treasure, it was easy to kill existences of the same level.<br/><br/>“We’ll head over immediately.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not hesitate and immediately instructed Ao Jin.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Ao Jin nodded.<br/><br/>“Willow deity, follow me to the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Just in case, Wang Xian called the willow deity.<br/><br/>“Oh? Dragon King, to the skysea Dragon Palace? I saw it on my brain. Someone said that the skysea Dragon Palace has disappeared.”<br/><br/>The willow deity flew over and said to Wang Xian in astonishment.<br/><br/>“Disappeared?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he heard her words. He looked at Ao Jin who was beside him.<br/><br/>“Disappeared? There’s only one possibility. He has possessed a physical body. Otherwise, the Dragon Palace wouldn’t have been able to move or disappear.”<br/><br/>Ao Jin frowned slightly.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
