There were already close to 30 powerhouses from the Heaven’s origin realm!<br/><br/>Any one of them was an existence who could wipe out a tribe with a wave of his hand. Yet, there were 30 of them here today!<br/><br/>They felt as though they were in hell.<br/><br/>This was especially so for some of the strong disciples who were close to Wang Xian. Combined with what Wang Xian had said just now, they felt a chill down their spines.<br/><br/>They were trembling!<br/><br/>At this moment, they felt as though they were no different from ants!<br/><br/>“Young master Wang Xian, Will Tianci be in danger?”<br/><br/>Mu Liyin’er’s body trembled slightly. She gritted her teeth and flew to Wang Xian’s side. She grabbed Tianci’s hand and asked.<br/><br/>“Don’t worry, I’m Here! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at Mu Liyin ‘er and nodded with a smile.<br/><br/>This scene did not exceed his expectations!<br/><br/>Looking over, Wang Xian noticed two familiar figures.<br/><br/>“Earth Sand City, we are defending above the arena. We can’t let them get close!<br/><br/>At this moment, on the battlefield, the golden leopard sensed that there were cracks in the golden barrier. His expression changed slightly and he immediately shouted at Earth Sand City!<br/><br/>Just now, he didn’t dare to stand on the stage.<br/><br/>Now that Sand City had arrived, he had this information.<br/><br/>Sand City was an earth-elemental heavenly creation realm expert, and in terms of defense, it far surpassed heavenly creation realm experts of the same level.<br/><br/>In comparison, his attack power was slightly weaker.<br/><br/>Good!<br/><br/>Sand City let out a wild roar, and his entire body transformed into an incomparably huge giant that stood tall between heaven and earth!<br/><br/>He directly flew towards the sky above the golden light barrier and stood tall above it.<br/><br/>The golden leopard immediately flew onto Earth Sand City’s body!<br/><br/>“Attack them! Break through this defensive barrier! The Heavenly Yuan creation treasure is inside! ”<br/><br/>When Bai Ke Fu Sheng saw so many heavenly yuan creation realm experts arriving, his eyes turned blood red as he roared!<br/><br/>“Attack!”<br/><br/>The experts from the void space also focused their gazes and attacked Earth Sand City and the golden leopard from the six paths universe!<br/><br/>Around 30 Heavenly Yuan creation realm powerhouses attacked the sand city and the Golden Leopard!<br/><br/>When they saw this terrifying attack, they took a deep breath.<br/><br/>“The center of Heaven and Earth, the Holy Beyond the Law! ”<br/><br/>The sand city let out a low roar and the surrounding soil covered him, forming<br/><br/>a huge giant beyond the law!<br/><br/>This giant was half the size of the Earth City.<br/><br/>The golden leopard used offense as defense, and attacked the attacks in front of him!<br/><br/>A Golden Cheetah’s figure devoured the sky and earth!<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>The alien giant’s figure was covered by the attacks, and it let out an intense rumbling sound!<br/><br/>The soil covered the entire sky.<br/><br/>(‘We can’t hold on for long! ”<br/><br/>Earth Sand City, which was under the attack of nearly thirty heaven origin creation realm powerhouses, changed its expression slightly, and growled in a low voice!<br/><br/>“The undead are almost here! ”<br/><br/>Jin Bao took out a treasure and inspected it before growling in a low voice!<br/><br/>However, in the next moment, his pupils constricted slightly.<br/><br/>On the treasure in his hand, not only did it show the location of the undead, there were also over forty red dots.<br/><br/>Each red dot represented a heaven origin creation realm expert.<br/><br/>“Damn it, there are actually so many heaven origin creation realm experts that have entered our universe! ”<br/><br/>The Golden Leopard’s heart sank!<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>Around 30 heaven origin creation realm experts continued to attack them!<br/><br/>Once they dodged, the golden light barrier below would be instantly destroyed.<br/><br/>Even all the expert disciples around the arena would be instantly killed.<br/><br/>And here, there were most of the elite disciples of their six paths universes.<br/><br/>“Hand over the Heavenly Yuan creation true treasure, or all the disciples of the six paths universes will die!”<br/><br/>Bai Kefu Sheng roared angrily when he saw the two heavenly yuan creation true treasures blocking their attacks.<br/><br/>“Six paths universes, don’t even think about taking over the Heavenly Yuan creation true treasure. I advise you not to seek your own death. Otherwise, your six paths universes will suffer!”<br/><br/>Another heavenly Yuan creation great being threatened!<br/><br/>This made the expressions of sand city and golden leopard extremely ugly!<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>“The dead, Battle Spirits! ”<br/><br/>At this moment, three enormous coffins appeared in the sky not far away!<br/><br/>The coffins quickly opened and three terrifying figures flew out! “Do you really think that our six paths universe is easy to bully?”<br/><br/>“Fight!”<br/><br/>Between Heaven and Earth, a murderous aura quickly formed.<br/><br/>Even the surrounding yellow sand quickly disappeared!<br/><br/>“Undead, Let’s work together and kill them. Even if we don’t want the<br/><br/>Heavenly Yuan creation true treasure, we have to leave a dozen of them behind! ”<br/><br/>Golden Leopard saw the appearance of the undead and saw the undead fighting with more than 40 heavenly Yuan creation realm experts in front of him. His face was filled with anger as he roared.<br/><br/>At this moment, their hearts were filled with anger!<br/><br/>This was totally bullying them! “Alright, killing them will be a huge resource. ”<br/><br/>The undead replied loudly.<br/><br/>“HMM? The six paths universe is not as weak as I imagined! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian, who was standing in the middle of the arena, saw that the three heaven origin creator level powerhouses from the six paths universe had arrived. When he saw the strength of the undead-type heaven origin creator level powerhouse, he revealed an astonished expression.<br/><br/>The golden leopard from the six paths universe and sand city had just stepped into the heaven origin creator-level.<br/><br/>They were not as strong as him.<br/><br/>However, this undead was very strong.<br/><br/>He had summoned three powerhouses who had just stepped into the heaven origin creator-level. Coupled with his own strength, he was comparable to an existence at the control level.<br/><br/>“Foster father, will the three lords from our six paths universe be their opponents?”<br/><br/>Tianci, who was standing at the side, could not help but ask when he saw the last powerhouse of the six paths universe coming!<br/><br/>“The strength of your six paths universe is stronger than I expected. Whether or not you can withstand it will depend on the trump cards of both parties and the other powerhouses. Whether or not they are willing to use their trump cards, overall, you are still at a disadvantage! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said!<br/><br/>Looking at it now, the six paths universe was equivalent to seven powerhouses who had just entered the Heaven’s origin manifestation level.<br/><br/>As for the other universes, there were more than 70 Heavenly Kismet realm powerhouses!<br/><br/>However, if these 70 Plus Heavenly Kismet realm powerhouses used their powerful trump cards, the Three Heavenly Kismet realm powerhouses from the six paths universe were still no match for them.<br/><br/>This was because the trump cards of these three powerhouses were definitely not as many as the 70 Plus Heavenly Kismet Realm powerhouses!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
