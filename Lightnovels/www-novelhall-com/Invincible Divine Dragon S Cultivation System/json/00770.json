Lin Wenluo, you’re already lagging behind!”<br/><br/>Crestford stared at the space beast, sneered, and waved his arm!<br/><br/>“Whoosh!”<br/><br/>The four Battle Metal Angels moved. They flapped the 12 wings of the machine, and energy shot out from the position behind them, directly attacking Lin Wenluo’s metal beast!<br/><br/>“Sita Battle Beast, Attack!”<br/><br/>Lin Wenluo shouted softly. The metal horns on the Sita Battle Beast’s head began to accumulate the power of storm. A wind sword attacked the four metal battle angels at a terrifying speed!<br/><br/>“Too weak. With our technology, we still can’t convert the energy of the ruler level. Close combat is the best choice!”<br/><br/>Chris chuckled. The wings of the four metal battle angels formed a shield in front of them and attacked the Sita Battle Beast at the same speed!<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>The Sita Battle Beast roared and welcomed the attack.<br/><br/>“Bang Bang Bang!”<br/><br/>In the next moment, the sound of metal colliding could be heard. The twelve wings of the metal battle angels were his weapons. Each wing was extremely sharp and contained a terrifying attack power.<br/><br/>Every strike had a loud sound.<br/><br/>Although Lin Wenluo’s battle beast was huge, it was not bloated at all. During the battle, sharp spikes could be seen from time to time!<br/><br/>There were even powerful cutting gears!<br/><br/>This was a battle between machines, a pure physical confrontation!<br/><br/>“This technological world is really powerful. As long as they are given enough materials, they will be able to improve qualitatively, even though it is only a physical attack.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the sudden outbreak of the battle and his face was filled with curiosity.<br/><br/>He did not make a move but just watched curiously.<br/><br/>The metal behemoth that Lin Wenluo had created had the combat strength of a ruler in the second stage.<br/><br/>As it was metal, it did not know pain. Unless it was destroyed, it would be very difficult to deal with.<br/><br/>Of course, this metal behemoth was perfectly countered by the Dark Clan.<br/><br/>The Dark clan could ignore physical attacks!<br/><br/>But even so, the technology world was already very powerful to be able to produce such powerful battle machines.<br/><br/>As for Crestleaf’s four metal battle angels, they were also comparable to masters at the second stage of the ruler realm.<br/><br/>With four of them attacking one, Lin Wenluo’s metal giant beast was quickly at a disadvantage!<br/><br/>“Lin Wenluo, you have already exceeded my expectations, but the current me is no longer the old me!”<br/><br/>Crestet looked at the battle in front of him and laughed loudly.<br/><br/>He waved his arm again, and this time, the same metal battle Angel appeared.<br/><br/>The Metal Battle Angel in the center was still emitting dense light power.<br/><br/>He was holding an angel sword in his hand!<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>Lin Wenluo’s pupils slightly shrank when he saw it. He stared at the Metal Battle Angel that was emitting the power of light with a shocked face.<br/><br/>“No, you didn’t create a technology that can transform a ruler-level energy. That Metal Battle Angel is supported by a special treasure that is emitting energy!”<br/><br/>Lin Wenluo quickly said loudly.<br/><br/>“Don’t worry. It Won’t be long before I’m able to create a technology that can transform a ruler-level energy.”<br/><br/>Kleis said indifferently, pointing his arm at him. “Now, I’ll give you the final choice. Join me, or I’ll destroy your place and make it mine.”<br/><br/>When Lin Wenluo heard his words, his expression was abnormally ugly!<br/><br/>“Bang! Bang! Bang!”<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>At this moment, at the side, there were fourteen metal battle angels and an existence whose strength was comparable to a dominator at level three. Their attacks landed on the body of the Sita battle beast, causing huge cracks to appear on its body. It was on the verge of collapse.<br/><br/>“Lackeys of the Angel clan!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this situation, his body moved and he flew forward slowly.<br/><br/>A cold and mocking expression was emitted from his mouth.<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s sudden words appeared beside Lin Wenluo. It stunned Kleis Fu for a moment and his gaze immediately locked onto him.<br/><br/>“Your Luck isn’t good. Whose Lackey is it? It has to be from the Angel clan.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at him and continued to speak plainly.<br/><br/>“Dragon Palace, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Crixus looked at Wang Xian and immediately analyzed Wang Xian’s expression from the database.<br/><br/>“I didn’t expect it. I really didn’t expect Lin Wenluo to join the Dragon Palace. How foolish, how foolish!”<br/><br/>He immediately turned his gaze to Lin Wenluo and spoke with a face full of mockery and disdain!<br/><br/>“We’re just cooperating!”<br/><br/>Lin Wenluo replied with an expressionless face.<br/><br/>“Needless to say, all the lackeys of the Angel clan must die!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said indifferently. His body moved and instantly flew toward the fourteen metal battle angels!<br/><br/>“D * MN Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Seeing Wang Xian flying toward his metal battle angels, Lie Sifu’s face changed drastically.<br/><br/>He naturally knew Wang Xian’s current strength and knew that he wasn’t a match for him.<br/><br/>“Come back quickly!”<br/><br/>He shouted loudly at his metal battle Angel. His eyes were slightly red.<br/><br/>He released all the Metal Battle Angels because he wanted to show off to Lin Wenluo.<br/><br/>In the end, he didn’t expect the proud and unyielding Lin Wenluo, who had always wanted to protect the glory of the technological world, to actually submit to the Dragon King.<br/><br/>This made him look extremely embarrassed.<br/><br/>“Bang! Bang!”<br/><br/>Fourteen Metal Battle Angels were still too slow for Wang Xian!<br/><br/>This was practically giving him resources.<br/><br/>He flew to the front of the group of Metal Battle Angels and stretched out his dragon claws to grab them.<br/><br/>Each metal battle Angel was only a few hundred meters in size. Under the coverage of the Dragon Claws, they were all grabbed by his hands.<br/><br/>He didn’t have any ability to resist at all.<br/><br/>“D * MN Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Upon seeing this scene, Kristen let out a furious roar with blood-red eyes.<br/><br/>He had built and accumulated over a hundred thousand years ago, and he had even used up a treasure that the angel race had given him. Yet, all of it was gone just like that?<br/><br/>“HMPH, you’re courting death!”<br/><br/>Upon hearing his roar, Wang Xian snorted coldly and flew over.<br/><br/>His terrifying speed caused him to have no time to react at all!<br/><br/>Crack! Crack<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw grabbed onto Krstic’s mech and crushed it with force!<br/><br/>The surrounding mechs were suspended in the air without any commands!<br/><br/>When Lin Wenluo saw this situation, he heaved a sigh of relief. However, he still had a worried expression on his face.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I’m afraid that we have been exposed. Dragon King, you have been exposed as well!”<br/><br/>He said to Wang Xian with a solemn expression.<br/><br/>In their world of technology, there was a relatively powerful and even heaven-defying point, and that was the cloning of bodies.<br/><br/>Every powerful scientist in the world of technology did not know that there was one clone body, or even dozens or hundreds of them.<br/><br/>They could share information.<br/><br/>To a certain extent, it was difficult for them to be wiped out even when they were stronger than the Dominators of the peak races.<br/><br/>To kill them, even if a Type 7 or 8 ruler attacked, the success rate would not reach 50.<br/><br/>This was the power of their technological world.<br/><br/>Crestford was not dead, and the windstorm continent would definitely be exposed.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
