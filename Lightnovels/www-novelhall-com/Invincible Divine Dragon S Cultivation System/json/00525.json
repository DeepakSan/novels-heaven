Go<br/><br/>The headquarters of the Hundred Cities Alliance was also known as the Hundred Cities Peak!<br/><br/>The one hundred and eight peaks here had stood on the inner continent of the heaven opening desolation for a very, very long time.<br/><br/>Similarly, the Hundred Cities Alliance Master had been stationed here for a very, very long time.<br/><br/>In the past, this was a city. Later on, the city disbanded and formed the headquarters of the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>The current leader of the Alliance of one hundred cities was the son of the former city leader of this city.<br/><br/>No one knew the name of the city leader of the Alliance of one hundred cities. All they knew was that he had the dragon head of the Demon Dragon and was an extremely terrifying magus!<br/><br/>“Dragon Head of the Demon Dragon? Hmph, I wonder how strong this leader of the Alliance of one hundred cities is. If he is weak, I will kill you!”<br/><br/>In the sky above the mainland, Wang Xian was flying at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>He was filled with killing intent towards this alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>Almost all the decisions and orders of the Hundred Cities Alliance were given by this alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Wang Xian had decided that if the divine dragon lineage were to return to its peak one day, the Dragon Palace would definitely destroy any wizard who dared to transfer the body of the divine dragon to him.<br/><br/>This was the dignity and dignity of the Divine Dragon tribe!<br/><br/>At their peak, even the ancestral wizard wouldn’t dare to do such a thing, let alone a wizard with the combat strength of a level three master of the universe.<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>Wang Xian flapped his incipient saint wings and dashed towards the hundred cities peak.<br/><br/>The hundred cities peak was still very far away from the water in the sky. Even if he were to fly there, it would still take him about a year.<br/><br/>Along the way, he used a few teleportation arrays and shortened the distance by half.<br/><br/>As the days passed, the Hundred City Alliance became one. After the name of the Hundred City, the remaining 80 city disciples and experts all moved to the Hundred City Peak.<br/><br/>At this moment, the Hundred City Peak was packed with people!<br/><br/>City guards and city legions were regrouped and formed into powerful legions.<br/><br/>There were more than eighty cities, and each city was at the level of a high-level race. When the elite disciples of their legions joined forces, it was exceptionally terrifying.<br/><br/>This combined force was probably inferior to even the spiritual demon race in terms of elite disciples.<br/><br/>After the hundred cities were regrouped, everyone knew that their target would be the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>Even the disciples of the hundred cities directly said on the universal AI that as long as the Dragon Palace was not destroyed, they would not scatter their strength.<br/><br/>Only by destroying the Dragon Palace would they be able to restore the former hundred cities alliance.<br/><br/>The Hundred Cities Alliance had almost 80 strong disciples. It wasn’t easy to gather them and choose a general or something like that.<br/><br/>With such a large number, it would take at least one to two years, or even more.<br/><br/>Half a year later, at the front of the hundred cities peak, a terrifying figure approached at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>“The hundred cities peak is right in front of us. All the remaining forces of the Hundred Cities Alliance.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian, who had been flying for half a year, stared ahead with a twinkle in his eyes.<br/><br/>The Shadows of the mountains appeared in front of him.<br/><br/>“Eh? What is that? There are powerful treasures on every city. It’s an innate spiritual treasure!”<br/><br/>As he approached little by little, he was able to sense some of the situation on the hundred cities peak.<br/><br/>His eyes flickered.<br/><br/>The leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance knew about formations!<br/><br/>Therefore, this battle could not be held within the hundred cities peak. It would be best if it was held here.<br/><br/>“Since that’s the case, I shall attract him over!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled and immediately stopped moving.<br/><br/>There was still a long distance from the hundred cities peak!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved his palm and the five elements millstone appeared in his hand. The energy of the five elements on it began to condense and form a sharp arrow!<br/><br/>The sharp arrow was emitting a gray color. With a wave of his arm, the shadow of a bow and arrow condensed in front of him.<br/><br/>Pull the bow and shoot the Arrow!<br/><br/>“Whoosh!”<br/><br/>The arrow formed from the terrifying energy of the five elements instantly shot toward the mountain peak in front of him.<br/><br/>The gray energy of the bow and arrow was extremely condensed and carried a terrifying power!<br/><br/>“Buzz!”<br/><br/>However, when the bow and arrow arrived in front of the Hundred City Peaks, the innate spiritual treasures on the 108 mountain peaks suddenly released a wave of power.<br/><br/>A wave of energy formed and attacked the bow and arrow shot by Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>The energy collided and the bow and arrow slowly dissipated. At the same time, the attack from the formation disappeared in an instant.<br/><br/>The terrifying collision seemed to cause the entire world to tremble!<br/><br/>However, the 108 peaks did not have the slightest fluctuation.<br/><br/>“What’s that sound?”<br/><br/>The sudden and terrifying collision caused countless people in the hundred cities peak to look over immediately. Their faces were filled with shock.<br/><br/>At this moment, a large number of people had gathered at the 108 mountain peaks. It even made the entire hundred cities peak seem a little crowded.<br/><br/>This collision naturally attracted countless people in an instant.<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>On the tallest mountain peak of the Hundred Cities Peak, the chief of the Hundred Cities Alliance flew directly to the sky and stared in the direction of Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance, Get Out Here!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a cold voice was heard.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>The voice was heard in the sky above the hundred cities peak, causing all the powerful disciples of the hundred cities to be slightly shocked. A group of universe masters with combat strength immediately flew into the sky and looked towards the source of the voice.<br/><br/>“Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>The alliance leader of the hundred cities stared at the blurry figure in front of him. His eyes were filled with coldness and killing intent.<br/><br/>“Hehe, Bai Cheng Alliance, haven’t you been arrogant enough to destroy my Dragon Palace? Ten years are almost up, yet you guys are hiding here instead. How Ironic!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at Chief Bai Cheng’s figure with disdain. His eyes were filled with killing intent as well.<br/><br/>“It won’t be long before the end of Your Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>The Bai Cheng Alliance leader said coldly.<br/><br/>“All of you have been saying this for ten years. Haven’t you abandoned the city and fled here, becoming a stray dog? Today, let me see the strength of your dog king. I want to see who gave you the courage to say that you want to destroy the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said coldly as he looked straight at the Bai Cheng Alliance leader.<br/><br/>“HMPH, you’re courting death!”<br/><br/>The leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance’s face slowly turned gloomy!<br/><br/>“Fellow from the Dragon Palace, if you have the guts, come over here!”<br/><br/>An expert from the Hundred Cities Alliance roared furiously.<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood there quietly and remained unmoved. The other party was a wizard. There were traces of the formation over there. How could he possibly go over.<br/><br/>If the leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance didn’t dare to come out, Wang Xian would be able to roughly assess his strength.<br/><br/>If he didn’t dare to come out in a one-on-one fight with someone of the same level, he would be a piece of trash!<br/><br/>Moreover, this matter would damage Bai Cheng’s reputation even more.<br/><br/>You still want others to charge into your lair?<br/><br/>Why Don’t you want others to charge into your grotto-heaven blessed land?<br/><br/>No one is that stupid!<br/><br/>“Today, I will kill you!”<br/><br/>The chief of Bai Cheng also understood that Wang Xian wouldn’t come over. He moved his body and flew toward Wang Xian instantly.<br/><br/>A staff appeared in his hand. On the staff, there was a blood-red eye inlaid!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
