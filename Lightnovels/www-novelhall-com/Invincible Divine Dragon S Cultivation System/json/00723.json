Who would have thought that the dragon palace would actually do that, at least five or six high-level races were exterminated by the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>“This time, the Dragon Palace sent out over 200 divine dragons. You guys didn’t see the 200 over jumping divine dragons flying in the sky at the same time, it was simply too shocking. Over 200 true dragons, all with the strength of a universe overlord Level 3.”<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace’s strength is much stronger than we expected. Over 200 pure-blooded dragons, the strength of a universe overlord Level 3. This is only what the Dragon Palace has displayed. There should be many more pure-blooded dragons that the dragon palace hasn’t displayed!”<br/><br/>“Too strong, the Dragon Palace’s strength is too strong now. Directly eliminating over 200 universe overlord Level 3 true dragons to sweep across the universe, this strength is invincible to any high-level race in the Universe!”<br/><br/>Along with the Dragon Palace’s attack, one race after another was exterminated, the Heaven Opening Primal Continent was in an uproar!<br/><br/>The strength of the Dragon Palace, the tyranny of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>Along with the strength of over 200 purebred dragons, all the strong disciples of the races were filled with shock!<br/><br/>Especially those over 200 universe ruler level 3 purebred dragons!<br/><br/>What kind of concept was that?<br/><br/>In the past, 20 to 30 universe ruler level 3 combat strength experts were already considered top-tier existences among the high-level races!<br/><br/>And the Dragon Palace had sent over 200 purebred dragons with universe ruler level 3 combat strength this time.<br/><br/>These were only purebred dragons!<br/><br/>The various races in the universe also knew that the Dragon Palace had mutated frost dragons, powerful wizards, and terrifying thorned dragon species.<br/><br/>There was also an invincible Dragon King!<br/><br/>In addition, the Dragon King had subdued seven mad demons in the Invincible Zone!<br/><br/>Each mad demon had the strength of a level one master of the universe.<br/><br/>“The bloodline of the Dragon Palace is too noble. High-level races can only fight two levels above them, and only mutated ones can fight three levels above them. and the experts and disciples of the Dragon Palace can easily fight three levels above them, which has made the Dragon Palace terrifying.”<br/><br/>“This is the power of the peak race. The Divine Dragon Clan has risen again. The Divine Dragon clan can not be offended!”<br/><br/>Some of the top experts of the high-level races exclaimed in their hearts!<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace had already broken away from the ranks of the high-level races!<br/><br/>It was too easy for the Dragon Palace to destroy a high-level race.<br/><br/>“Pass down the order. All the disciples of the Green Sky Authentic sect are forbidden to enslave anyone who attacks the Divine Dragon Bloodline. Anyone who disobeys will be killed without mercy!”<br/><br/>“Pass down the order, all members of the Ying Mei clan are forbidden to hurt anyone with the Dragon God bloodline. Anyone who disobeys will be killed without mercy!”<br/><br/>“The dense forest clan announces that all disciples are forbidden to enslave anyone who attacks the Dragon God bloodline. Anyone who disobeys will be killed without mercy. In addition, I wish the Dragon Palace to advance to the peak of the Clan!”<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Not long after, the clan leaders, leaders, and city lords of the powerful high-level clans in the Heaven Opening Primal Continent issued orders one after another.<br/><br/>Some even directly announced on the universe AI that it was forbidden to enslave anyone who attacked the Divine Dragon Bloodline. Anyone who violated this rule would be killed without mercy!<br/><br/>Some even wished the Dragon Palace to advance to the peak of the race.<br/><br/>With the first race’s announcement, more and more races followed suit!<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace’s momentum had been established, and the invincible talent had been condensed.<br/><br/>Now that they were above the high-level races, the high-level races knew how to curry favor with them.<br/><br/>“HMM? I didn’t expect the Dragon Palace to have reached such a level, and the Dragon King has already grown to such a level!”<br/><br/>At the same time, in the spiritual demon race, the spiritual demon king looked at the information on the universal AI and was shocked!<br/><br/>“That Dragon King is indeed not simple. He must have received the inheritance of the powerful Dragon King of the Divine Dragon Clan. It’s very likely that he received the inheritance of a few top-tier dragon kings. Moreover, it’s the inheritance of a few top-tier dragon kings. His strength is much stronger than a ruler at the first stage.”<br/><br/>Beside him, Spirit Demon King’s father-in-law, black vulture king, was sitting on the skeleton throne. His eyes were shining. “Perhaps his current strength is not much weaker than mine.”<br/><br/>“Oh? Father-in-law, it can’t be. After all, the Dragon King has not broken through to the ruler of the universe. How can he compare with you, father-in-law?”<br/><br/>Spirit demon king was slightly surprised and said!<br/><br/>“I know a little about the power of the Mad Demons in the Invincible Zone. They all have the power to kill A Level One universe dominator, and the Dragon King can kill a mad demon in an instant. His combat power is no weaker than an ordinary level two universe dominator.”<br/><br/>The Flames in the black vulture King’s eyes jumped as he said!<br/><br/>“The Dragon King is already so strong?”<br/><br/>Spirit Demon King’s face was filled with shock.<br/><br/>“Hehe, the Dragon King is very strong. Our Red Bone is also very strong. The inheritance that red bone obtained is very terrifying.”<br/><br/>Black vulture king smiled and looked ahead.<br/><br/>There, the spirit red bone floated in the air. Waves of blood red energy burned with flames, completely enveloping it.<br/><br/>It made it seem as if it was undergoing a Nirvana!<br/><br/>The spirit red bone was indeed going through a nirvana, in less than 1,000 years, he would be able to break through to the universe ruler realm.<br/><br/>The most important thing was the inheritance of the spirit red bone.<br/><br/>Her inheritance, even black vulture emperor felt extremely terrifying!<br/><br/>Even though black vulture emperor’s strength wasn’t at the peak amongst the universe rulers, but he still had the vision!<br/><br/>To be able to make him feel terrifying inheritance, to be able to make the peak race skeleton race’s experts feel terrifying inheritance, one could imagine.<br/><br/>Just as the high-level races of the heaven opening primal continent were trying to curry favor with the Dragon Palace on the universe ai.<br/><br/>On the side of the surrounding Lu Xing Kong, some of the races knew deep down that they were courting death!<br/><br/>In the surrounding Lu Xing Kong, a level 5 or 6 universe Knight was already considered a top-tier battle!<br/><br/>And this time, they had to face a pure-blooded dragon with the combat strength of A Level 3 universe master!<br/><br/>“No, no, no, we are a race that encircles the starry sky. Your Dragon Palace is a race from the heaven opening primal continent. You Can’t Kill Us, or you’ll be punished!”<br/><br/>A starry sky domain that surrounded the starry sky!<br/><br/>More than ten planets gathered together.<br/><br/>But at this moment, all the great disciples on the planets were lying on the ground, their eyes filled with fear and despair!<br/><br/>“The divine dragon can not be offended, the dragon’s might can not be touched, die!”<br/><br/>A fire god Dragon stared at them coldly, slowly raising its dragon claws!<br/><br/>Under his dragon’s might, all the powerful disciples on the planet could not move at all!<br/><br/>The powerful dragon’s might could even crush them to death!<br/><br/>“Boom Boom Boom!”<br/><br/>The fire god Dragon raised its dragon claws, directly grabbing towards the planets!<br/><br/>In an instant, the sound of explosions rang out. The planets were like balloons as their claws were crushed.<br/><br/>A race that had wantonly nurtured and enslaved the Asian Dragons had been destroyed.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
