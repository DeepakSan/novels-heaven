The Treasures of the Righteous God race were taken by the powerful forces of the Open Sky Primal Continent?”<br/><br/>“The Great Beings of the Lich Kingdom in the Open Sky Primal Continent took the treasures of the Righteous God Race? This… this…”<br/><br/>“No Way, it really was taken by the Lich Kingdom? That Dragon Palace lost too much this time!”<br/><br/>“This is the god country of over 10,000 knights, and all the treasures of the Righteous God race, it’s actually occupied by the Lich Kingdom!”<br/><br/>“The Lich Kingdom’s strength is very strong, they have over 10 universe Knight Level 8 warriors, with the Dragon Palace’s strength, they aren’t their match at all.”<br/><br/>On the Universe AI, when someone released news about the treasures of the righteous God race, it caused a huge commotion.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace destroyed the two races and warned all the races not to touch the treasures of the two races.<br/><br/>The forces surrounding Lu Xing Kong did not dare to touch them.<br/><br/>However, they did not expect that the powerful forces of the heaven opening primal continent would dare to touch them and even completely occupy them.<br/><br/>Lu Xing Kong did not know much about the lich kingdom.<br/><br/>But they also knew that this wasn’t an ordinary force at the edge of the heaven opening primal continent.<br/><br/>It was a powerful existence.<br/><br/>Through the universe AI, they could find out some basic information about the lich kingdom.<br/><br/>Not to mention other things, just the dozen or so universe knight level 8 Great Beings weren’t something Wei Lu Xing Kong’s forces could compare to.<br/><br/>Even the Dragon Palace wasn’t a match for the Lich Kingdom.<br/><br/>Furthermore, now that an expert had been revealed, even if the Dragon King rushed over, he would only be able to escape with his tail between his legs.<br/><br/>If the treasure of the Righteous God race was obtained by someone else, it would definitely be a huge loss to the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the Dragon Palace was still unable to do anything to the other party.<br/><br/>This caused the experts of the surrounding Lu Xingkong to discuss in astonishment.<br/><br/>This was not a small blow to the prestige of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the information on the universe’s AI, and his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>“Hehe, if I’m not mistaken, it was that guy who escaped that exposed it.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled.<br/><br/>They had already occupied the treasure, so there was no need to anger the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>After all, even though the dragon palace was not as strong as them, there were still experts who were on par with them in terms of peak combat strength.<br/><br/>That meant that he had killed more than a dozen experts.<br/><br/>One of those people had escaped with the help of a powerful life-saving treasure.<br/><br/>Looking at the messages from the same account, his eyes turned cold.<br/><br/>Not only were there the two messages from the beginning, but there were also many who said that the Dragon King was trash. Such an existence would be killed sooner or later in the heaven-opening primal continent.<br/><br/>They also said that the Dragon Palace should not be too arrogant. There were many powerful existences in the heaven-splitting chaotic land. If they were arrogant, they would be destroyed.<br/><br/>After sending more than a dozen messages, it could be seen that this guy had a great hatred for the Dragon King.<br/><br/>“This must be the keyboard warrior. Did he really think that he couldn’t do anything to you just because you escaped with your life?”<br/><br/>The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly, and a cold look appeared in his eyes.<br/><br/>He had already kept the dozen or so corpses. Through the corpses, he could find out which faction the other party came from in the heaven-splitting primordial land.<br/><br/>The other party only dared to babble on in the universe’s AI. It could also prove that the strength of this race was inferior to that of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Otherwise, they wouldn’t be hiding behind the keyboard, shouting, taunting, and cursing.<br/><br/>As time passed day by day, it was gradually confirmed that the treasures of the righteous God race had been occupied by the powerhouses of the Lich Kingdom in the heaven-splitting primordial land. Furthermore, all of them had been taken away.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace had also entered the surrounding starry sky. They did not go to the righteous god race, but flew directly to the ancient sea race.<br/><br/>The Divine Kingdoms of the ancient sea race were hidden everywhere. Moreover, the treasures of the ancient sea race could not be compared to those of the righteous God race. Therefore, no forces in the heaven-opening primeval continent coveted the treasures of the ancient sea race.<br/><br/>After another ten days, the Dragon Palace arrived at the starry sky where the ancient sea race was located.<br/><br/>In the next few days, the Dragon Palace began to search for the divine kingdoms of the Great Beings of the ancient sea race.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I have made a breakthrough!”<br/><br/>Two days later, the strength of the Heaven Array had a complete breakthrough.<br/><br/>A Universe Knight Level Seven was considered pretty good on the heaven opening desolation continent.<br/><br/>“En, okay, come with me!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the heaven array and said.<br/><br/>In the twelve days, apart from gathering more information about the Lich Kingdom, he was also waiting for the Heaven Array’s strength to break through.<br/><br/>This time, he still needed the Heaven Array to investigate some things.<br/><br/>For example, the ten or so races that he had killed.<br/><br/>That guy had been clamoring on the universe’s AI for so long, and Chu Xian was prepared to go over and give them a surprise.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The sky array nodded.<br/><br/>“We’ll go over directly. You go into the mother nest and wait for orders!”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, he waved his arm and kept the sky array into the mother nest.<br/><br/>He gave Prime Minister Gui an order and flew out of the Dragon Palace to the ancient sea race’s planet’s teleportation array.<br/><br/>Currently, the Dragon Palace was receiving all the treasures and heritage of the Ancient Sea Race.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Dragon Palace was also temporarily staying in a sea area.<br/><br/>Through the two transmissions of the teleportation formation, Wang Xian’s figure appeared once again on the planet of the ancient sea race in front of the heaven-splitting chaotic land.<br/><br/>Now, this planet had been taken over by the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s figure moved and flew in the direction of the heaven-splitting chaotic land at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>After flying for half an hour, an incomparably vast land appeared in his line of sight.<br/><br/>An ancient aura that seemed to come from the chaotic land came from the land in front of him.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the indescribably huge land and felt the chaotic aura. A faint sense of respect rose in his heart.<br/><br/>Heaven-splitting chaotic land.<br/><br/>The center of the universe, the first land at the beginning of Heaven and earth.<br/><br/>The place where all living things were born.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at this boundless and vast continent and slowed down slightly.<br/><br/>As the continent got closer and closer, he could feel his insignificance.<br/><br/>Even though he had already reached the combat strength of a level eight universe knight, he still felt insignificant on this continent.<br/><br/>On the continent, there were all kinds of tall trees, all kinds of huge mountains, and all kinds of desolate beasts flying in the sky and running below.<br/><br/>“Is this the heaven opening primal continent? Even the spiritual energy is abnormally dense.”<br/><br/>When he arrived in the sky above the heaven opening primal continent, Wang Xian’s heart was slightly shaken as he swept his gaze across the surrounding grass and trees.<br/><br/>In the heaven opening primal continent, every living being had the possibility of gaining sentience.<br/><br/>Plants, mountains, and even rivers had the possibility of gaining sentience.<br/><br/>Therefore, in the heaven opening primal continent, it was best not to destroy recklessly.<br/><br/>You may be attacked by the roots and territories of a powerful being if you are not careful.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
