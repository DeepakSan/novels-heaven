The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. With a movement of his body, he disappeared instantly!<br/><br/>‘ ‘HMM?”<br/><br/>At the front, the four kings of the gods wanted to escape from the pursuit of Wang Xian and the rest.<br/><br/>All of a sudden, they sensed that the aura of Wang Xian and the rest had disappeared.<br/><br/>This caused them to be slightly stunned. Their faces were filled with astonishment.<br/><br/>“What’s going on? Did the Dragon King and the rest just leave?”<br/><br/>One of the kings of pantheon frowned and asked.<br/><br/>“Their departure doesn’t seem to be a direct return in a normal state. Instead, they disappeared in an instant. Something’s Not Right. ”<br/><br/>A king of Pantheon frowned.<br/><br/>The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had been chasing them for three days.<br/><br/>Why did they suddenly leave?<br/><br/>“It’s a bit strange. They were chasing us in vain, so they couldn’t pose much of a threat to us. But the Dragon King still chased us for three days, and now he’s suddenly disappeared. It must be premeditated! ”<br/><br/>A king of the gods said with certainty.<br/><br/>“Not good. could he have done something to the Qianjiang Beast Emperor, driving us out of a certain distance and going back to hunt the Qianjiang Beast Emperor himself! ?”<br/><br/>A king of the gods in the center said with a slight change in expression.<br/><br/>“It’s really possible. ”<br/><br/>The other three kings of the gods said with grim expressions!<br/><br/>This was the only reason.<br/><br/>“Damn it, we’ve been played by him!”<br/><br/>One of the kings of the gods said with a gloomy face!<br/><br/>“Come, let’s go. We Can’t let the Dragon King have his way!”<br/><br/>The four kings of the gods didn’t hesitate at all and flew directly to the spot they had just been at.<br/><br/>With their strength, although they would be suppressed by the Dragon King and the others, they wouldn’t be in any danger.<br/><br/>Therefore, they were not afraid that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had other plans.<br/><br/>They must not let the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace have his way.<br/><br/>Let the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace hunt down the Beast Emperor Qian Jiang.<br/><br/>They must not let him have a good time!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>However, when the four kings of Pantheon flew towards the location just now.<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian’s figure had already appeared beside the Beast Emperor Qian Jiang!<br/><br/>After Qian Jiang Beast Emperor was severely injured by Wang Xian, he immediately used his powerful innate skill to escape!<br/><br/>He was also extremely far away from where they were fighting.<br/><br/>Wang Xian used the netherworld dragon to give chase and locked onto him.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! ”<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>When Qian Jiang Beast Emperor saw Wang Xian appearing, he was instantly shocked.<br/><br/>He fled into the distance with a face full of fear.<br/><br/>Splash<br/><br/>The surrounding water currents condensed into water droplets and dispersed in all directions.<br/><br/>He used his powerful innate skill to escape.<br/><br/>The Beast Emperor Qian Jiang also knew that he was no match for the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>If he didn’t escape, he might be killed.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this scene, he moved his palm and the book of water forbidden spell floated in the air.<br/><br/>Waves of water energy were swirling towards the Qian Jiang Beast Emperor.<br/><br/>Using water energy to create water energy.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s usage of the water attribute was far superior to the Qian Jiang Beast Emperor!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s body trembled and the power of space vibrated. In an instant, he teleported to the largest body of the Qian Jiang Beast Emperor.<br/><br/>His dragon claws were clawing at his body.<br/><br/>“Awoo! Awoo!”<br/><br/>A blood-curdling scream was heard. A huge piece of flesh and blood of the Qian Jiang Beast Emperor was directly grabbed out by Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Dragon Tomb, Burial! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian let out a low growl as nine types of energy circulated around his body. The nine-colored light slowly turned earthy yellow.<br/><br/>A huge dragon tomb was directly buried toward the Qian Jiang Beast Emperor.<br/><br/>When the Qian Jiang Beast Emperor saw this scene, he let out a terrified roar.<br/><br/>Splash! ”<br/><br/>The long river around him was divided into dozens of sections!<br/><br/>Each section of the river was escaping in a frenzy.<br/><br/>Among them, half of the river was spinning and forming a whirlpool.<br/><br/>Slowly, the river water seemed to sink into the river and disappeared! When Wang Xian saw this scene, his expression changed slightly.<br/><br/>“Divine Dragon Chains! ”<br/><br/>With a low growl, numerous gigantic chains appeared around him.<br/><br/>The gigantic chains entwined with the river flows.<br/><br/>Inside these river flows, there were some bodies of the river-moving beast emperor.<br/><br/>These bodies were all alive and could even unleash a powerful attack.<br/><br/>Wang Xian destroyed the vitality of more than ten parts of the body of the river-moving Beast Emperor and continued to pursue it according to the power of the wind and thunder to lock down the enemy!<br/><br/>This time, the Beast Emperor was still very far away.<br/><br/>Wang Xian, who had just used the chasing power of the Netherworld Dragon, could not continue to use it in such a short period of time.<br/><br/>However, his speed was still very terrifying.<br/><br/>The flight of his body coupled with the teleportation power of space.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s speed was about ten times that of the Beast Emperor.<br/><br/>However, according to Wang Xian’s senses, the Beast Emperor did not merge the more than ten parts of his body.<br/><br/>Instead, they were fleeing in different directions rapidly.<br/><br/>Two hours later, Wang Xian caught up with the first part of the body.<br/><br/>After he easily suppressed and killed it, Wang Xian continued his pursuit.<br/><br/>In the next ten days, Wang Xian continued his pursuit.<br/><br/>“The last one!”<br/><br/>More than ten days later, Wang Xian stared at the last part of the body of the Qian Jiang Beast Emperor. His eyes were glowing.<br/><br/>He flew over and waved his arm.<br/><br/>The severely injured Beast Emperor was easily caught by Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Wang Xian held it in his hand and smiled.<br/><br/>He did not destroy all the vitality of the beast emperor.<br/><br/>Once the Beast Emperor was completely destroyed, there would be an additional spot in the starry universe.<br/><br/>However, Xiao Lan had yet to reach the stage where she could make a breakthrough!<br/><br/>Therefore, he was prepared to preserve the vitality of the Beast Emperor Qian Jiang.<br/><br/>“However, before that, I can first check if the Beast Emperor Qian Jiang has been completely captured and destroyed! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s mind stirred. He cast soul capture on the piece of flesh of the Beast Emperor Qian Jiang that was still alive.<br/><br/>A stream of information was transmitted into Wang Xian’s mind very quickly.<br/><br/>“HMM? He’s still alive. ”<br/><br/>Very soon, from this piece of flesh, Wang Xian discovered that apart from this piece of flesh, there were other forms of energy and life force.<br/><br/>In other words, even if Wang Xian destroyed this piece of flesh, the Beast Emperor would not die completely.<br/><br/>“As expected of a space beast.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sighed slightly. It must have been when Beast Emperor Qian Jiang was escaping that some of his flesh escaped and left behind his life.<br/><br/>This life had the foundation of the Heaven’s origin realm and could recover very quickly.<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head. Although it was a pity that he did not get this heaven’s origin realm quota in the universe, it was still a huge profit to obtain the flesh and blood of a space beast!<br/><br/>This was a huge amount of resources.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was prepared to stay for the time being.. He wanted to start storing resources for his breakthrough!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
