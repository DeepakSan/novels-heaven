Go<br/><br/>Translator: 549690339<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved his body and entered the area where light and darkness intersected.<br/><br/>The interior of the Elemental God, who was at the level of Great Dao, was completely enveloped by the energy radiance.<br/><br/>Even quicksand could not enter it.<br/><br/>The radiance emitted by the two attributes was close to the center. These two types of energy seemed to be corporeal!<br/><br/>The light and darkness energy kept colliding and intersecting in the interior of the two elemental gods, forming a terrifying scene!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian entered the interior, he immediately felt an extremely terrifying energy invading him.<br/><br/>Not only was it the light energy, even the dark energy was attacking him directly!<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. The energy in his body began to change immediately.<br/><br/>Yin-yang reversal!<br/><br/>The coexistence of yin and yang.<br/><br/>Under such circumstances, Wang Xian was able to avoid the erosion of darkness and light!<br/><br/>Entering the interior of the two elemental gods, Wang Xian scanned his surroundings.<br/><br/>The surrounding energy seemed to be corporeal. Wang Xian’s vision and perception were greatly obstructed.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this area wasn’t too big.<br/><br/>Even if Wang Xian’s perception was obstructed, he could still search through everything within a dozen hours!<br/><br/>With this thought in mind, Wang Xian began to survey his surroundings.<br/><br/>There were no rumbling sounds around him. Everything was like a strange black and white pattern!<br/><br/>The space was extremely strange!<br/><br/>Wang Xian surveyed his surroundings and began to search for treasures.<br/><br/>“Let’s not talk about anything else. If I were to cultivate here, my speed would be more than a thousand times faster than the tree of Chaos!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed the power of light and darkness.<br/><br/>If he could cultivate here, one day would be equivalent to a thousand days at the tree of Chaos!<br/><br/>For a ruler realm disciple, that was even more so!<br/><br/>Of course, it was also very difficult for a ruler realm disciple to cultivate here!<br/><br/>He needed to dilute the power here.<br/><br/>This also made him think of Saint Saint Saint Saint Saint Saint Saint Saint and the others using the god of elements fragments to attract the energy in the chaotic area and then let the disciple cultivate.<br/><br/>A ruler realm disciple cultivating in this situation was probably dozens of times better than the tree of Chaos!<br/><br/>After all, the energy contained in the god of elements fragments of Saint Shan Tian and the rest was extremely powerful!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian saw a special glowing substance in front of him.<br/><br/>Yes, it was a substance and not just pure energy.<br/><br/>This substance was like a mirror!<br/><br/>It contained a special type of light energy.<br/><br/>The power of light had many different states.<br/><br/>The powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin creation with the light attribute could use the power of light to form a passage to escape.<br/><br/>They could use the power of light to form a defense or a special attack method.<br/><br/>Naturally, the material formed by the power of light also had special methods and abilities.<br/><br/>Wang Xian focused his gaze and immediately grabbed at the special mirror of light!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Wang Xian grabbed the mirror and held it tightly as he looked at it with joy.<br/><br/>A surge of energy was injected into it. In the next instant, the mirror emitted a kind of light.<br/><br/>Following that, the power of the light merged into the surrounding area. It could not be seen or touched and completely merged into the surrounding space.<br/><br/>However, the mirror could show the surrounding scene!<br/><br/>“This is? A powerful treasure for scouting? This mirror is definitely a treasure. It is much more powerful than the scouting treasure forged by the twelve ancestral warlocks!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the mirror and was delighted.<br/><br/>He did not expect to encounter a treasure not long after he entered this place.<br/><br/>This kind of scouting treasure was rare, regardless of whether it was used by him or placed in the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>Wang Xian was pleasantly surprised. He immediately put it away and continued to scan his surroundings!<br/><br/>“That is the fragment of the god of elements!”<br/><br/>Every twenty minutes, Wang Xian was moving slowly inside. He was attracted by a black stone!<br/><br/>The fragment of the God of darkness, which was the size of a human head, contained a powerful energy.<br/><br/>This was like the flesh and blood that fell from the corpse of a Great Dao master. It was also extremely beneficial to a master who had just entered the Heavenly Yuan blessed realm.<br/><br/>The energy of the god of elements fragment in front of him was comparable to the energy of the two pieces of God of elements fragment from Saint Shan Tian!<br/><br/>Very good!<br/><br/>Wang Xian was pleasantly surprised. He continued to search inside continuously!<br/><br/>Very soon, he found more pieces of God of elements fragments than he did.<br/><br/>In a short three hours, he found six pieces!<br/><br/>The value of these six pieces of God of elements fragments had already far surpassed the eight pieces of Saint Shan Tian and the rest.<br/><br/>“TSK TSK, this treasure is practically free for me to pick up. Other Great Dao level experts can not enter this place at all, but I can easily roam around here, so I can easily obtain the fragments of the Elemental God Here!”<br/><br/>One was a great dao level darkness elemental god, and the other was a great dao level light elemental god.<br/><br/>Two unconscious creatures were engaged in a life-and-death battle here. Only the existence of the sound of Great Dao would be able to enter this place safely.<br/><br/>Otherwise, if an ordinary great dao-level creature entered this place, they would be forcefully exhausted to death by the two elemental gods!<br/><br/>With three or four great dao-level creatures working together, it might be safe to enter this place.<br/><br/>However, if the two elemental gods were to riot here, it might break the balance of the surroundings.<br/><br/>At that time, other accidents might happen.<br/><br/>Therefore, Great Dao level experts didn’t want to take too big a risk for these treasures.<br/><br/>After all, even if there were many treasures here, even if there were no accidents, the treasures here would still need Great Dao level experts to split them equally.<br/><br/>It wasn’t worth the risk!<br/><br/>Looks like I’ll have to look for more places like this in the future. I can enter it safely<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself as a smile appeared on his face!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>However, just as Wang Xian was feeling happy, perhaps he was gloating over someone else’s misfortune, a surge of energy suddenly rushed towards him!<br/><br/>This made Wang Xian’s expression change. He quickly dodged to the side!<br/><br/>“HMM? I’m getting closer to the side of the god of light elements!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian quickly looked over and saw a ball of light in front of him.<br/><br/>Looking at this ball of light energy, Wang Xian retreated a little!<br/><br/>All the energy here burst out from the bodies of the two god of elements!<br/><br/>If he were to get close to them, their attacks would be indistinguishable.<br/><br/>It would cover everything in front of him.<br/><br/>Even if Wang Xian was able to convert yin and yang, it would be useless!<br/><br/>Therefore, he had to stay further away from the Elemental God. Otherwise, it might cause the elemental god to riot and attack him!<br/><br/>“Eh? There seems to be a treasure near the elemental god of light!”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian noticed that there was a treasure that looked like a sharp sword beside the elemental god of light.<br/><br/>It looked like a sword without a hilt. It was filled with terrifying and palpitating energy!<br/><br/>“This is a very powerful treasure. At the very least, it has the offensive power of someone who has just entered the Heaven’s origin Creation Stage!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself!<br/><br/>Chapter 4296: 4295 treasure hunt!
