Our senior brother of the Thunder Ray race is really invincible!”<br/><br/>“Strong, one against seven peak-stage universe knights, Hahaha!”<br/><br/>When the leader of the Thunder Ray race and the rest heard Wang Xian’s words, they were excited.<br/><br/>They did not expect Wang Xian to be so invincible.<br/><br/>After killing two peak universe knights, one of them could still fight against seven.<br/><br/>This was too strong!<br/><br/>Now, after Wang Xian helped them to fend off seven peak universe knights, they only had to face eight peak universe knights.<br/><br/>Seven against eight. Under such circumstances, the four forces of the Great Thunderclap Academy could forget about defeating the Thunder Ray tribe.<br/><br/>This time, the crisis of the Thunder Ray tribe could be overcome.<br/><br/>Next, it was time for them to take revenge!<br/><br/>“Kill! Our eldest senior brother killed two experts at the peak, and he’s not at a disadvantage against seven. Kill them, kill them!”<br/><br/>The members of the Lightning Race’s army and all the disciples heard the words of the Great Thunderclap Academy’s expert, and all of them revealed extremely excited expressions.<br/><br/>With their morale soaring, their battle strength also soared.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the armies and disciples of the Great Thunderclap Academy, Divine Thunder City, Purple City, and Liuyan City, the four major forces, looked extremely embarrassed.<br/><br/>Their fighting spirit had been completely crushed.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s appearance had directly killed millions of disciples. Now, he had displayed such terrifying strength.<br/><br/>The disciples also understood in their hearts that they had lost this time!<br/><br/>This was especially so for the disciples from the Divine Thunder City, Purple City, and Liuyan City. It was already very difficult for them to win this battle. They were afraid that they would have to suffer the revenge of the Thunder Ray tribe.<br/><br/>This was undoubtedly a nightmare for them.<br/><br/>“Headmaster of the Great Thunderclap Academy, what should we do now? We can’t break through the defensive line of the Lightning race at all!”<br/><br/>The city lord of Purple City had a gloomy expression as he transmitted his voice to the headmaster of the Great Thunderclap Academy.<br/><br/>The headmaster of the Great Thunderclap Academy’s expression was also constantly changing. He felt the wild and violent attacks of the Lightning Race’s clan head and the others in front of him. His expression was gloomy and uncertain.<br/><br/>Eight against seven. Although they had the advantage, if they really fought to the end, at least half of them would die.<br/><br/>If they killed a thousand enemies, they would lose eight hundred. They also couldn’t bear the consequences.<br/><br/>“Hu hu!”<br/><br/>The Great Thunderclap Academy’s headmaster scanned the surroundings. The battle on the disciples’side wasn’t one-sided.<br/><br/>After all, this was the Thunder Race’s territory. The Thunder race had the geographical advantage. If they killed three thunder race’s disciples, they would also lose two on their side.<br/><br/>It was not worth it at all!<br/><br/>“Damn it, we can’t win at all now. Let’s retreat first. We’ll discuss it in detail after we retreat!”<br/><br/>The headmaster of the Great Thunderclap Academy gritted his teeth and made a decision with a gloomy face.<br/><br/>The bodies of the experts from Liuyan City, Purple City, and divine thunder city trembled and nodded with a dark face.<br/><br/>Especially for Divine Thunder City, the losses this time were too great.<br/><br/>Even the city Lord had died here.<br/><br/>“All the disciples of the Great Thunderclap Academy retreat, all the disciple Corps retreat!”<br/><br/>The Great Thunderclap Academy’s Headmaster roared loudly, his voice filled with unwillingness.<br/><br/>It was not easy to rope in a few large factions, and it was not easy to find such an opportunity, but because of a big senior brother of the Thunder Ray race, he suffered a crushing defeat.<br/><br/>He was unwilling!<br/><br/>But he was helpless!<br/><br/>“Retreat, all the disciples of Divine Thunder City Retreat!”<br/><br/>“All the disciples of Purple City Retreat!”<br/><br/>“All the disciples of Liuyan City Retreat!”<br/><br/>Orders rang out on the battlefield. From the start of the battle until now, it had been less than five minutes.<br/><br/>To retreat at such a time was also their last resort.<br/><br/>It was impossible to obtain a great victory, and there was no need to continue fighting.<br/><br/>Now, they would retreat and discuss their next plan.<br/><br/>“Retreat, quickly retreat!”<br/><br/>“HU, damn it. This time, we have no way to deal with the Lightning race. They will definitely take revenge on us next!”<br/><br/>“How can the Lightning race’s eldest senior brother be so strong? How can he fight against seven by himself?”<br/><br/>“Our Divine Thunder City’s City Lord was killed by the Lightning race’s eldest senior brother. He is too terrifying!”<br/><br/>The disciples of the army retreated, and they growled in a low voice, looking extremely embarrassed.<br/><br/>The death of two Pinnacle Universe Knights was already a great loss to them.<br/><br/>In addition, there was also the eldest senior brother and the disciples of the Great Thunder Sound Academy.<br/><br/>They had lost too much in this battle.<br/><br/>Next, they had to face the revenge of the Thunder race.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, a bunch of trash, continue to besiege us!”<br/><br/>“Zi City, Liuyan City, Divine Thunder City, all of your disciples, wait for me. In the future, I will kill every single one of you!”<br/><br/>“Today’s Revenge, our lightning race will come back one by one. Just you wait!”<br/><br/>All of the Lightning race’s powerful disciples shouted at them excitedly.<br/><br/>Especially the strong disciples of the three cities, they were prepared to take revenge.<br/><br/>“Thunder Ray race, don’t be too arrogant. If you can escape today, you can not escape tomorrow!”<br/><br/>The headmaster of the Great Thunderclap Academy and the rest roared indignantly and quickly got rid of the leader of the Thunder Ray race and the rest.<br/><br/>“Retreat!”<br/><br/>At the same time, the seven peak universe knights who were fighting with Wang Xian heard the order and heaved a sigh of relief.<br/><br/>The seven of them immediately flew together and stared at Wang Xian vigilantly. They kept retreating.<br/><br/>It was too depressing to fight with the eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray race.<br/><br/>The opponent’s speed was not something they could match. The opponent could fight whenever he wanted, sneak attack whenever he wanted, and retreat whenever he wanted.<br/><br/>There was nothing they could do at all.<br/><br/>“There’s no need to chase after them. We, the Thunder Ray race, will make them pay ten times or even a hundred times for what they did today!”<br/><br/>The leader of the Thunder Ray tribe shouted softly and ordered his disciples not to chase after them.<br/><br/>Seeing that the seven of them were retreating, Wang Xian did not chase after them.<br/><br/>It would be extremely difficult for him to hunt them down.<br/><br/>The Cloud and mist dragon disappeared. Wang Xian transformed into his human form and floated in the air. He looked at the four major forces that were retreating.<br/><br/>His gaze swept behind him. With a move of his body, he flew directly towards the position of the leader of the Thunder Ray tribe and the rest.<br/><br/>“Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>“Eldest senior brother!”<br/><br/>The leader of the Lightning race and the grand elder shouted when they saw Wang Xian flying over.<br/><br/>The group of elders also flew over and greeted him as eldest senior brother.<br/><br/>There was joy, shock, and even more disbelief in their eyes.<br/><br/>At the same time, they also suspected that the eldest senior brother of the Lightning race was not that simple.<br/><br/>With such strength, he would be considered a powerhouse in the ancestral dragon tribe.<br/><br/>Why did he come to the Thunder Ray Tribe?<br/><br/>With all their guesses, they looked at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Tribe leader, Elder!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew over and smiled at them.<br/><br/>“Let’s talk in the main hall. Thank you for this battle. If it weren’t for you, our thunder ray tribe might not have been able to survive this crisis!”<br/><br/>The leader of the Thunder Ray tribe patted Wang Xian’s shoulder with a smile and said.<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head.<br/><br/>Since his strength had been exposed, there was nothing left to hide.<br/><br/>Moreover, he had returned the favor this time!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
