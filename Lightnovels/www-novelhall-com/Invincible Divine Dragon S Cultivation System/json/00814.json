There was almost a hundred percent chance of friction and even a huge battle.<br/><br/>Everyone wanted to seize more resources. They could even kill the other party and snatch their resources.<br/><br/>This was the rule between the universe and the universe.<br/><br/>Competition!<br/><br/>Slaughter!<br/><br/>One year later, Wang Xian was getting closer and closer to the passage. He lowered his flying speed and kept the five elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Disc.<br/><br/>This was his trump card and his greatest reliance.<br/><br/>After the improvement of the Tai Chi Dragon Disc and the five elements millstone, Wang Xian could even fight against Xiao Lan and the others with these two trump cards.<br/><br/>He would not expose himself unless it was absolutely necessary.<br/><br/>After putting away the Tai Chi Dragon Disc and the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, Wang Xian continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>A huge world passage slowly appeared. There were also some experts flying over from the surrounding areas.<br/><br/>The experts from the peak races sensed Wang Xian and looked over with flickering eyes. There was a hint of awe in their eyes.<br/><br/>All the experts from all the races knew Wang Xian’s current strength very well.<br/><br/>He could easily kill an existence at level seven of the Overlord realm.<br/><br/>At level seven of the Overlord realm, he was an invincible existence.<br/><br/>Even if he had a powerful supreme treasure, he could not kill the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>This was because his speed was too fast and terrifying!<br/><br/>This was the first time Wang Xian flew out of the world passage.<br/><br/>In the past, due to the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan, Wang Xian had ordered an lie to teleport him.<br/><br/>This was the first time he flew over openly.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, over here!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian flew out, a noble elf from the Elf clan waved at him with a smile on his face.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the big elf and felt the terrifying aura from him. He smiled.<br/><br/>“Hello, Queen Elf!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew over and greeted her respectfully.<br/><br/>He would never forget the gratitude of the Elves!<br/><br/>“The last time you came to the elves, I sensed you. After not seeing you for a while, the Dragon King has actually grown to such an extent. I’m afraid it won’t be long before he can be on par with me!”<br/><br/>The Queen Elf Smiled at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>It was obvious that she treated him as a powerhouse of the same level.<br/><br/>It was not that the elven queen did this on purpose to gain Wang Xian’s favor. Instead, the elven queen was certain that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was able to reach her level.<br/><br/>After all, the last time Wang Xian entered the elf tribe, he only had the strength of a supremacy.<br/><br/>It had only been a million years and he had already reached such a level, forcing the Angel tribe and the Phoenix tribe to lower their heads.<br/><br/>In the future, he would almost certainly be able to step into the peak of the Overlord realm.<br/><br/>Moreover, the Dragon King who had reached the peak of the Overlord Realm, the elven queen was certain that she was no match for him.<br/><br/>This was because she knew how many attributes Wang Xian possessed.<br/><br/>When he reached the peak of the Overlord realm, he would probably possess an invincible strength under the Heaven’s origin!<br/><br/>“Elven Queen, you are so amazing. I’m afraid there is still a long way to go before I can reach your level.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head politely!<br/><br/>“Hehe, that might not be the case!”<br/><br/>The Elven queen smiled.<br/><br/>“Dragon King!”<br/><br/>At the side, the rest of the great elves also smiled at Wang Xian and greeted him.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and chatted with them briefly.<br/><br/>“Dragon King!”<br/><br/>“Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>Not long after, Wang Xian heard a voice.<br/><br/>He looked over and revealed a smile.<br/><br/>Three figures flew over. The leader was a red-robed spiritual red bone.<br/><br/>Beside him was his grandfather, the black vulture king, as well as another overlord of the skeleton race.<br/><br/>“Red Bone, black vulture king, you guys are here too!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze across them and smiled. “Hong Gu, I didn’t expect you to improve so quickly after not seeing each other for more than a million years!”<br/><br/>“How can I be considered fast? Compared to you, I’m already very slow, alright?”<br/><br/>Ling Hong Gu was a little speechless when he heard Wang Xian’s words.<br/><br/>Ling Hong Gu’s current strength had already broken through to the fourth stage of the Dominator realm. The speed of his improvement was extremely heaven-defying even among the peak races.<br/><br/>However, the difference between him and Wang Xian was too great!<br/><br/>Of course, the main reason was that Wang Xian was able to surpass many levels. His current realm was only at the second stage of the Dominator realm.<br/><br/>“Hello, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The skeleton clan’s experts bowed to Wang Xian and greeted him respectfully.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, this is the nether bone king, my boss!”<br/><br/>The black vulture king introduced him.<br/><br/>“Oh? Hello, King Netherbone King!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard that, he immediately nodded.<br/><br/>The Netherbone King was the king of the black vulture king. However, the strength of the spirit red bone king had improved by leaps and bounds. Furthermore, they knew Wang Xian. Hence, the Netherbone King was very polite to the black vulture king and the rest. He did not treat them as his subordinates at all.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I’ve heard so much about you!”<br/><br/>The Netherbone king immediately smiled and said.<br/><br/>Wang Xian exchanged a few pleasantries with him before looking at Ling Honggu. “How are things in the Starry Universe? Judging from how fast you’ve improved, you must have obtained many opportunities, right?”<br/><br/>“It’s alright. The main thing is that there aren’t any restrictions on my current improvement.”<br/><br/>Ling Honggu and Wang Xian had not seen each other for a long time. The two of them began to chat.<br/><br/>Not long after, some of the experts from the skeleton clan also came over and began to chat with Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Now that the Dragon Palace had reconciled with the Angel clan, the Phoenix clan, and the Dragon Palace possessed invincible power in the starry universe, many peak races were very willing to befriend Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Soon, a king from the skeleton clan, who was at the peak of dominance, came over and exchanged a few pleasantries with him!<br/><br/>“Oh right, Skeleton King, Elven queen, do you guys know about the belief universe?”<br/><br/>After chatting for a long time, Wang Xian asked.<br/><br/>“We skeleton race don’t know much. We were born after the last calamity, but I’m sure the elven queen must know a lot about it. I’m also a little curious.”<br/><br/>The Skeleton King, who was at the peak of the Dominator realm, smiled and looked at the elven queen.<br/><br/>The peak of the race had never been involved in a large-scale war, so their relationship with each other was pretty good.<br/><br/>“Believe in the universe. This is a very powerful universe. Everyone should know that other than our universe, there are many other universes. Each universe has a different cultivation system.”<br/><br/>The Elven queen looked at them and started to introduce!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
