They heard the screams and immediately looked over with their eyes wide open.<br/><br/>As far as their eyes could see, they saw the willow leaves swiftly piercing through the universe Knight Level 2 warriors.<br/><br/>Under the terrifying attack of the willow leaves, the universe knight level 2 warriors couldn’t resist at all.<br/><br/>What kind of terrifying attack was this?<br/><br/>“Universe Knight Level 4, Dragon Palace has another universe knight at Level 4!”<br/><br/>Their bodies started to tremble, and their hearts were filled with despair.<br/><br/>How could they defend against two universe knights at Level 4?<br/><br/>“No, no, it’s only been three years, how can dragon palace improve at such a terrifying speed?”<br/><br/>The ancient art sect leader roared in disbelief.<br/><br/>“Bang, Bang, Bang!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the shadows of the Holy Dragon, which had only been slightly blocked, completely landed on the ground.<br/><br/>Their bodies trembled violently as they fell towards the ground.<br/><br/>Although they didn’t die, they were still severely injured.<br/><br/>“Dragon Tomb, you can die now!”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian came to the sky above them and waved his dragon claws gently.<br/><br/>A pitch-black divine dragon that was emitting Earth and darkness attributes appeared and coiled around them.<br/><br/>At the moment of the entanglement, it took the shape of a coffin and suppressed them inside.<br/><br/>“No, no, no, don’t kill us. We are willing to submit, submit!”<br/><br/>A desperate voice came out of the Heavenly Dragon Duke’s mouth. His body trembled as he begged for mercy.<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>However, at this moment, the coffin slowly closed. What awaited them was destruction.<br/><br/>“Not good, not good. Our sect master and the others have been killed!”<br/><br/>When the sect master and the others’life force disappeared, a terrified voice came from the side.<br/><br/>Hearing this voice, everyone from the ancient art sect panicked.<br/><br/>The surroundings were covered in clouds and mist. They couldn’t see far at all.<br/><br/>Now, they could only feel that the powerful warriors of the Dragon Palace were slaughtering the venerables of their ancient art sect.<br/><br/>The screams were incessant.<br/><br/>Until now, they still couldn’t understand why the Dragon Palace suddenly erupted with such terrifying strength.<br/><br/>Why did the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace suddenly appear.<br/><br/>Wasn’t he killed by the Sky Dragon King?<br/><br/>“Leave no disciple of the two races alive!”<br/><br/>The seven universe knights were suppressed by Wang Xian. With a wave of his arm, the clouds dispersed and he shouted coldly.<br/><br/>“Kill!”<br/><br/>When the clouds dispersed completely, all the disciples of the Sky Dragon Clan of the ancient painting sect saw the scene around them.<br/><br/>In the middle, a huge coffin stood in the sky.<br/><br/>The sect leader of the ancient painting sect, the Sky Dragon Mother and the other universe knights had disappeared.<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, the level 2 universe knights from the two powers had all been killed.<br/><br/>There were less than 50 Level 1 universe Knight Disciples.<br/><br/>When the disciples from the two powers saw this scene, their eyes revealed a look of extreme fear.<br/><br/>“This… how is this possible!”<br/><br/>One of the disciples roared in disbelief.<br/><br/>In such a short period of time, almost all of their great beings had been killed. How could it be so terrifying.<br/><br/>“Leave no one alive. Keke, Keke, little ones, kill everyone from the two large factions for me.”<br/><br/>Ba Qi’s body was covered in blood as he roared with a ghastly face.<br/><br/>He had injured himself in the previous battle. This time, he wanted to let everyone from the two large factions know what fear was.<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>His entire body emitted a might. The terrifying dragon might caused the heaven dragon clan’s disciples to tremble. Their faces were filled with panic.<br/><br/>They widened their eyes and were filled with shock.<br/><br/>Some of the Heavenly Dragon clan members who were below level five Emperor God realm did not even have the strength to resist under this terrifying pressure.<br/><br/>“Kill!”<br/><br/>The disciples of the Dragon Palace were filled with killing intent as they charged toward the disciples of the ancient painting sect, the Heavenly Dragon Clan.<br/><br/>“Don’t Kill Us, don’t Kill Us!”<br/><br/>When the disciples of the two forces saw that more than half of their knights had been killed, their faces were filled with terror and despair. They wanted to submit.<br/><br/>Hong<br/><br/>However, at this time, all the disciples of the Dragon Palace, including dozens of knights, had already charged over.<br/><br/>Surrender?<br/><br/>If they could win, they wanted to destroy the Dragon Palace. If they couldn’t win, they wanted to surrender.<br/><br/>How could there be such a good thing in this world.<br/><br/>Waves of terrifying energy engulfed them. Following that, a one-sided massacre began.<br/><br/>If people didn’t invade the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace would never invade others.<br/><br/>Since they came to destroy the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace would destroy them too.<br/><br/>This was war.<br/><br/>“Hiss, this, this…”<br/><br/>At this moment, the warriors who were observing the situation in the surrounding void space were shocked when they saw this scene.<br/><br/>What was going on? Such a huge change happened in such a short time.<br/><br/>In such a short period of time, more than 100 universe knights were massacred.<br/><br/>Hiss!<br/><br/>This…<br/><br/>After the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace returned, he was actually so terrifying that he turned the tide of the battle in an instant.<br/><br/>Looking at the disciples and powerhouses of the ancient painting sect and the Heavenly Dragon clan being massacred so quickly, their bodies trembled.<br/><br/>From the time Wang Xian and the rest came out to the time when the powerhouses of the two major forces were killed, it had only been a few minutes.<br/><br/>This was a huge suppression of their strength.<br/><br/>Wang Xian didn’t need to make a move in the upcoming battle.<br/><br/>He hovered in the sky above the Dragon Palace and looked at them coldly.<br/><br/>With the willow deity around, the venerables from the two major forces had no room to resist.<br/><br/>The disciples from the two major forces were being slaughtered rapidly.<br/><br/>They were fleeing in a state of collapse, but how could they escape the pursuit of the experts from the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The following battle was one-sided.<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and the two ancient paintings and the golden dragon bead flew towards his hands.<br/><br/>His eyes were sparkling as he looked at the two ancient paintings.<br/><br/>A powerful spiritual treasure with Earth attribute.<br/><br/>It was an extremely powerful existence among acquired spiritual treasures.<br/><br/>He waved his arm and the five elements millstone appeared in his hand. He then started to devour the ancient paintings.<br/><br/>He sized up the two golden dragon beads in his hand and hesitated for a moment. He did not absorb the five elements millstone.<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, there were postnatal numinous treasures beside the corpses of some venerables.<br/><br/>There weren’t many of them, but there were more than twenty of them.<br/><br/>Most of them had five elements attributes.<br/><br/>They could completely make the five elements millstone swallow them.<br/><br/>In addition to these two extremely powerful ancient paintings, the five elements millstone should be able to make a breakthrough.<br/><br/>On the battlefield, the disciples of the two big forces were quickly slaughtered. Ten minutes later, all the disciples of the ancient painting sect and the Heavenly Dragon Clan were killed.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, all of them have been dealt with!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui flew over. His eyes were sparkling.<br/><br/>“Bring half of the Dragon Palace’s venerable level people with you. We will make a trip to the ancient painting sect and the Heavenly Dragon Clan’s Lair!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said faintly.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
