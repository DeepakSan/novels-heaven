If the experts from the Alliance of 100 cities want to exterminate the Dragon Palace, it might take a few months.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled and continued to help the great mill of five elements and the Yin-yang dragon plate absorb the treasures to improve themselves.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Two days later, an Lie’s figure returned to the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian opened his eyes and disappeared under an Lie’s coverage.<br/><br/>When they reappeared, they had already arrived at the river of eternity.<br/><br/>Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and immediately flew toward the center of the river of eternity.<br/><br/>His speed was very fast. After dozens of hours, they arrived at the center.<br/><br/>This place was the center of the battle between the Water Touch King and the Baili Archangel not long ago.<br/><br/>That battle had also shocked Wang Xian.<br/><br/>It was a strange innate treasure with a terrifying destructive power!<br/><br/>“It’s at the bottom of the center. There’s an entrance there. The entrance is blocked and there’s no way to enter.”<br/><br/>The king of water touch pointed to a location and said to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and flew away immediately.<br/><br/>The previous battle did not cause much change in the river of eternity.<br/><br/>The water in the sky continued to fall.<br/><br/>The only difference was that there seemed to be fewer dire beasts in the surroundings. They should have fled into the distance.<br/><br/>Or they might have been killed by the angel race.<br/><br/>Wang Xian came to the lowest position. Under the command of the King of water touch, he saw an entrance with a diameter of 10,000 meters.<br/><br/>The entrance was filled with blue light. It was as if one could enter another world.<br/><br/>“An lie, you go in. Be careful.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian instructed an lie.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>An lie nodded. He looked at the entrance and his figure disappeared.<br/><br/>When the king of water tentacles saw an lie disappear, he was deep in thought.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Two seconds later, an Lie’s figure returned.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, it’s dead silent inside. There are only some skeletons on the ground.”<br/><br/>An lie reported to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Bring me in.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded. The next moment, he entered the interior of the grotto-heaven blessed land under the guidance of an lie.<br/><br/>A stream of water energy that was more majestic than the outside world was transmitted over. Wang Xian took a look inside.<br/><br/>At this moment, there were many ancient buildings in the interior. The buildings were somewhat dilapidated.<br/><br/>It was obvious that there were signs of battle.<br/><br/>There were many corpses on the ground. Only bones were left behind. It was as though they had been dead for a very long time.<br/><br/>The interior of this paradise was not very big. It was about the size of three to four dragon palaces.<br/><br/>However, such a place was still too small for a race.<br/><br/>“It could be that living in this narrow space for a long time has triggered an internal conflict among the race.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled and made a guess.<br/><br/>If it was any other powerhouse who lived in such a narrow space for a long period of time, they would also be driven crazy.<br/><br/>The same was true for the Tianshui race. They were squeezed here and could not see the sun, which triggered an internal conflict.<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head and flew around the surroundings. A satisfied expression appeared on his face.<br/><br/>“System, establish a Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>With a thought in his mind, one resource after another flew forward. A small dragon palace that was weaker than the main dragon palace was built very quickly.<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and entered the Dragon Palace directly.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace had a teleportation formation. However, in this sealed paradise, the teleportation formation would be blocked.<br/><br/>In other words, teleportation could not be carried out.<br/><br/>However, there was still an lie.<br/><br/>The demon spirit altar could ignore such rules.<br/><br/>After setting up a demon spirit altar, an lie brought Wang Xian back to the main dragon palace immediately.<br/><br/>“Very good. Even if the real main dragon palace is in danger, it can teleport instantly.”<br/><br/>A smile appeared on his face. The current Dragon Palace could be said to be 100% safe.<br/><br/>“With that powerful grotto-heaven blessed land, the Dragon Palace has the qualifications to fight against the Hundred Cities Alliance.”<br/><br/>His eyes flickered slightly and revealed a sinister look.<br/><br/>“First, I will completely upgrade the Tai Chi Dragon Plate of the great mill of the five elements.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian muttered to himself.<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. The appearance of the Dragon Palace was still in an uproar within the mainland.<br/><br/>Countless disciples of the Hundred Cities Alliance said that the Dragon Palace was simply courting death and would definitely be destroyed by them.<br/><br/>Regarding this, the disciples of the other races also silently agreed.<br/><br/>During this period of time, everything about the dragon palace had been dug out.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace might have improved very quickly, with the Dragon King and the other experts, but the hundred cities alliance was even stronger.<br/><br/>It was so strong that even the ancestral dragon lineage had to care about the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>The Hundred Cities Alliance had already given the order to kill, so the Dragon Palace was most likely doomed.<br/><br/>In the ocean in the mountains and seas, 23 terrifying figures stood quietly on the body of a desolate beast.<br/><br/>This was a desolate beast that was like a sharp sword.<br/><br/>Its body was flat, its wings were extremely sharp, and its head and mouth were flat and sharp.<br/><br/>The entire desolate beast gave off a terrifying blade aura. Golden and green light surrounded its surroundings, and its speed was abnormally terrifying.<br/><br/>This was the universe ruler level two desolate beast, Jin Fengxi. This was the name of the desolate beast.<br/><br/>Its name was very special, but it was a terrifying existence.<br/><br/>Twenty-three powerful figures stood on it and shuttled across the sky above the ocean.<br/><br/>Before some seabirds could sense them, they flew over directly.<br/><br/>“Phew, the Five Elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate have finally improved!”<br/><br/>A month and a half later, in the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian smiled when he saw that the two treasures had been upgraded.<br/><br/>The Five Elements Millstone was about the same level of strength as Wang Xian himself, but the Tai Chi Dragon Disc was still one realm lower.<br/><br/>He took out the universal AI and searched for some information.<br/><br/>He couldn’t help but smile when he saw the discussions within the mainland and the comments from some of the strong disciples of the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>Everything had just begun.<br/><br/>“Eight-limbed demonic fiend!”<br/><br/>He shouted softly and his voice entered the ears of the eight-limbed millstone.<br/><br/>At this moment, after more than a month, the eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest had already received an upgrade.<br/><br/>This time, they had obtained five level one battle-power corpses of universe overlords, and three members of the poisonous horned dragon species had been upgraded to level one battle-power of universe overlords.<br/><br/>Two of the thorned dragon species had been upgraded to level one battle-power of universe overlords.<br/><br/>“I’m Here!”<br/><br/>Soon, they flew over and bowed to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Get an lie to bring you to the Dragon Palace in the river of eternity. Then, lock onto the target and invade the Hundred Cities Alliance.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he gave the order.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King. I promise to complete the mission.”<br/><br/>The eight-limbed demonic fiend licked his lips and revealed an excited expression.<br/><br/>The last time, their venom horned dragon species was able to cause the fall of the four cities without any improvement. Now, it was even easier for them.<br/><br/>They could even rely on their venom horned dragons to occupy the cities bit by bit.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
