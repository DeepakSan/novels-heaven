His life force had completely disappeared.<br/><br/>“You won’t let me off? Just You Wait? What do you mean? Are you still confident that you can survive?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the demonic dragon Emperor’s corpse. His eyes were sparkling.<br/><br/>He waved his arm and kept the demonic dragon emperor’s corpse.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, Dragon King killed that Devil Dragon, we won, we won!”<br/><br/>“Dragon King is invincible, he even killed that universe knight level seven Devil Dragon.”<br/><br/>“We won, we won, that’s Great!”<br/><br/>Excited voices came from all the strong disciples of the Water Dragon Palace below. When they saw Dragon King killing Devil Dragon Emperor, their eyes were filled with excitement.<br/><br/>A great victory!<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>The Heaven Formation Water Dragon King and the rest moved and immediately came to the sky. They looked at Wang Xian with excitement.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, Are You Alright?”<br/><br/>The Water Dragon King and the rest asked with concern.<br/><br/>“I’m fine. It’s totally worth it to be able to kill the Demonic Dragon Emperor.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled.<br/><br/>Although he was severely injured this time, this injury was nothing compared to his gains.<br/><br/>However, this battle was indeed the most serious injury Wang Xian suffered.<br/><br/>He was almost half-dead.<br/><br/>If he were to rely solely on absorbing spiritual energy to recover, it would probably take tens of thousands of years.<br/><br/>It would also take a lot of energy to recover with spiritual herbs and pills.<br/><br/>“This time, it’s all thanks to the Dragon Palace. If it weren’t for the Dragon King, Our Water Dragon Palace would have been destroyed.”<br/><br/>The Water Dragon King said respectfully.<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, the three fellows from the Dragon Palace have been taken care of.”<br/><br/>At this moment, an Lie’s figure appeared at the side and reported.<br/><br/>“HMM, bring me into the dark world of the Devil Dragon. The Devil Dragon Emperor shouldn’t have been completely destroyed.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head in satisfaction and said to him.<br/><br/>“HMM? The Devil Dragon Emperor hasn’t been destroyed?”<br/><br/>When the Water Dragon King heard Wang Xian’s words, he revealed a look of surprise.<br/><br/>“I’m just guessing. The words of the Devil Dragon Emperor before his death mean that he might have some supreme treasure to resurrect himself.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian guessed.<br/><br/>An Lie’s figure disappeared and soon returned.<br/><br/>“Dragon King!”<br/><br/>“Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>An lie and Wang Xian disappeared in an instant.<br/><br/>The next moment, they entered the dark world of the Demon Dragon.<br/><br/>Outside, the Heaven Formation Water Dragon King and the rest began to clean up the battle.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, this form of Dragon Palace is really strange.”<br/><br/>An lie and Wang Xian entered the dark world of the Demon Dragon.<br/><br/>An lie scanned the surroundings and said with a face full of curiosity.<br/><br/>The Dark World of the demonic dragon had some similarities, but they were completely different.<br/><br/>This space was similar to Xiao Lan’s Kun’s domain, which was a separate space.<br/><br/>There were also some buildings in the Dragon Palace, such as the Dragon Field and the power of the Dragon’s lair.<br/><br/>However, the entrance to the Dark World of the demonic dragon was located below. The higher they went, the more they were at the center of the Dark World of the demonic dragon.<br/><br/>“The lineage of the demonic dragon has subdued and destroyed the three great dragon palaces. There should be quite a number of treasures inside. Let’s go to the deepest part of the palace to investigate first.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian transformed into his human form and moved. The five elements grinding mill surrounded him and he immediately flew towards the sky.<br/><br/>Gulp, Gulp<br/><br/>At this moment, there was a huge pool located at the back of the Dragon King’s Palace in the Demonic Dragon Dark World.<br/><br/>In the middle of the pool, there was an extremely deep black energy liquid.<br/><br/>At this moment, bubbles emerged from the pool and a young demonic dragon emerged from it.<br/><br/>“Roar Roar, damn it, damn it. Fortunately, I have this ancient Devil Pool and can revive. Dragon Palace Dragon King, just you wait.”<br/><br/>The young Devil Dragon’s expression was extremely ferocious as he roared sternly.<br/><br/>This devil dragon was naturally the Devil Dragon Emperor that had been revived. At this moment, he was extremely weak and could only sense the might of a godly king.<br/><br/>This time, the Devil Dragon Emperor’s losses were too great. If he wanted to return to his peak, it would take at least a few hundred million years, or even more.<br/><br/>“As expected, Devil Dragon Emperor, you have been resurrected.”<br/><br/>However, just as Devil Dragon Emperor’s expression changed drastically as he was pondering over the next situation, a voice was suddenly heard.<br/><br/>Devil Dragon Emperor’s expression changed drastically as his eyes revealed a look of fear.<br/><br/>“How did you guys get in? How did you guys get in?”<br/><br/>He looked over hurriedly as his gaze was fixed on Wang Xian and an lie. He was on the verge of collapse as he roared.<br/><br/>The Dark World of the Devil Dragon was not a place that one could enter just because they wanted to.<br/><br/>“Hehe!”<br/><br/>“Soul capture!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian ignored the desperate emperor of the Devil Dragon. With a wave of his arm, he cast soul capture.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>A large amount of information entered Wang Xian’s mind, causing him to slowly close his eyes.<br/><br/>Time passed little by little. He slowly opened his eyes, and there was a burning look in his eyes.<br/><br/>“The ancient demon pool is the treasure of the Master of the Dark World of the demonic dragon. It is an innate spiritual treasure that can bring a person back from the dead. It can only be used once. After using it, the ancient demon pool will no longer have any effect on it. However, it will still have an effect on others.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the ancient demon pool in front of him and muttered to himself based on the memories in his mind.<br/><br/>Treasures were divided into the postnatal realm and the postnatal realm corresponded to the level of a universe knight. The postnatal realm was then divided into the postnatal spiritual treasure and the postnatal supreme treasure.<br/><br/>Some of the branches on the ancestral tree were regulated by the universe knight level. Because of the existence of the ancestral tree, the pre-sky spirit treasure level could also be upgraded to the pre-sky true treasure level.<br/><br/>Therefore, it was not divided by the pre-sky upper sky.<br/><br/>And the pre-sky was corresponded to the universe master level.<br/><br/>A single pre-sky spirit treasure could allow a universe master level one to easily defeat an opponent of the same level without a pre-sky spirit treasure.<br/><br/>Every innate numinous treasure possessed a terrifying ability.<br/><br/>This ancient Devil Pool was considered the best among the innate numinous treasures. Although it wasn’t a combat type, its ability to revive was extremely powerful.<br/><br/>“It’s a pity that it doesn’t have much of an effect on me. I have the soul-returning wood of the master level, but it does have some effect on an lie.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself.<br/><br/>If an lie were to go to a faraway place, he would be able to revive in the ancient demon pool if he were to die.<br/><br/>It would also be a huge guarantee for his life.<br/><br/>“Other than this most precious ancient demon pool, there are many other treasures in the Dark World of the Demonic Dragon.”<br/><br/>According to the memories in his mind, his body moved and he immediately flew towards the back of the ancient demon pool.<br/><br/>Over there was the Devil Dragon Emperor’s treasure house.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>After opening the treasure house, Wang Xian entered it. His eyes scanned the surroundings as his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>There were three acquired Supreme Treasures with metal attributes, one with wind attribute and one with thunder attribute.<br/><br/>All of these were obtained from the bloodline of the Red Gold War Dragon, the Wind Thunder Divine Dragon.<br/><br/>Other than that, there were two acquired Supreme Treasures with Earth attribute. These were obtained by the Devil Dragon Emperor by accident.<br/><br/>“According to my memory, there is an extremely powerful treasure in the deepest part of the Treasury. It was left behind by the Master of Devil Dragon Dark World.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued to walk deeper into the treasury.<br/><br/>There was a huge seal in the deepest part of the treasury that sealed the items inside.<br/><br/>Traces of white light were revealed.<br/><br/>The reason why it was sealed was because it was a treasure of the light attribute.<br/><br/>Wings of angels, wings of a Master of the universe.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
