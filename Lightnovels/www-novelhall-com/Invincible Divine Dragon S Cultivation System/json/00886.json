Boom! Boom<br/><br/>The fragment of the Starfield was flying forward, struggling to break free from the intercepting energy.<br/><br/>Lan Qingyue and Xiao Lan had no idea what to do with this fragment of the Starfield.<br/><br/>Moreover, the speed of the fragment of the Starfield was getting faster and faster.<br/><br/>It wouldn’t be long before it would widen the distance between them.<br/><br/>Wang Xian felt helpless when he saw this scene. He was afraid that he wouldn ‘t be able to get his hands on this fragment of the Starfield.<br/><br/>Lan qingyue, who was at the side, also shook her head helplessly.<br/><br/>This might require an even stronger force to be able to stop it.<br/><br/>“Forget it! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head and said to Lan Qingyue.<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar! ”<br/><br/>However, as soon as he finished his sentence, an extremely terrifying energy shrouded over this area.<br/><br/>This terrifying and vast energy caused the expressions of Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue to change drastically.<br/><br/>This extremely vast energy gave people an unusually overbearing and invincible feeling.<br/><br/>Although this energy wasn’t directed at Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue, at this moment, they felt as though they were in a terrifying ocean.<br/><br/>They were like a small ship in the ocean.<br/><br/>As long as a gust of wind and waves came over, they would be crushed.<br/><br/>“Not good, Xiao Xian. There’s an extremely terrifying existence flying towards us.”<br/><br/>Lan Qingyue looked towards the depths of the boundless starry sky and said to Wang Xian with a face full of shock. “Yes, let’s go. We have to stay far away from here! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian replied immediately.<br/><br/>Xiao Lan and the rest did not need to give orders. They immediately flew in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>Crash<br/><br/>However, at this moment, an explosion came from the front.<br/><br/>In the next second, Wang Xian, Lan Qingyue, and the rest saw a figure appearing out of thin air in front of them.<br/><br/>He appeared in front of the fragment of the Starfield.<br/><br/>His enormous body covered the entire starry sky. He had an oval-shaped body that was similar to Xiao Lan and the rest.<br/><br/>The difference was that there were two enormous whiskers in front of him.<br/><br/>There was also a glowing ball on the whiskers.<br/><br/>The entire Space Beast had an invincible and vast aura of a king.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw the space beast appear out of thin air, his pupils constricted slightly.<br/><br/>“Master, Dragon King, it’s the Chaotic Space Beast, the powerful Wonton.”<br/><br/>At this moment, Xiao Lan’s voice was suddenly heard.<br/><br/>“Chaotic?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest were slightly surprised.<br/><br/>Chaos, a chaotic space beast.<br/><br/>A top-tier space beast that lived in the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>At that time, the passageway between the nine-origin universe and the starry universe was opened by him and a few other top-tier space beasts.<br/><br/>It was an absolute overlord-tier space beast in the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>It was an absolute overlord-tier existence.<br/><br/>Tens of millions of years had passed. By now, it should have eliminated the suppression of the starry universe.<br/><br/>In other words, his current strength was extremely terrifying.<br/><br/>Under the astonished gazes of Wang Xian and the rest, the two glowing spheres above his head shone with a ray of light.<br/><br/>The Ray of light enveloped the fragment of the starry universe. “What is he doing? He wants to obtain the fragment of the starry universe. ” When Wang Xian and the rest saw it, they were astonished.<br/><br/>A galactic behemoth that was at the top of the nine-origin universe and a galactic behemoth that was exceptionally powerful in the universe actually came here.<br/><br/>Furthermore, he was attacking the galactic fragment.<br/><br/>“His target is the galactic fragment. A treasure of this level is enough to attract a galactic behemoth of this level. ” Lan qingyue mumbled.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. Let’s leave this place.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian only took a glance and immediately gave an order to Xiao Lan.<br/><br/>An existence of this level was not someone they could afford to provoke.<br/><br/>Without the suppression of the starry universe, an existence at the pinnacle of dominance could easily kill them.<br/><br/>They were not on the same level at all.<br/><br/>After all, Xiao Lan and Lan Qingyue were merely at the seventh level of dominance.<br/><br/>The gap between them was too huge!<br/><br/>Such existences were the best in the starry universe.<br/><br/>Especially when they were more intelligent than the local space beasts!<br/><br/>Xiao Lan did not hesitate and escaped immediately!<br/><br/>However, the moment Wang Xian and the rest escaped, the space beast suddenly looked over!<br/><br/>He did not do anything. He looked at the fragment of the Starfield with a glint in his eyes.<br/><br/>The starfield fragment was completely restrained by his energy.<br/><br/>The powerful force of the Starfield fragment couldn’t escape at all.<br/><br/>It even flew towards Hun Dun.<br/><br/>“A fragment at the heaven origin creation level. This is a good treasure. ”<br/><br/>He mumbled. Without any movement, he suddenly turned towards the spot where Wang Xian and the rest had disappeared.<br/><br/>“It seems to be the Dragon Kinz of the Dragon Palace. He has great potential! ” Hun Dun mumbled.<br/><br/>Although he was a space beast, he was different from the space beasts in the starry universe.<br/><br/>His intelligence was the same as the living beings in the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>Even when they were in the nine-origin universe, the top-tier Space Beasts used the universe’s Al.<br/><br/>He knew about the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The main reason was that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was too famous.<br/><br/>He even knew some of his deeds in the universe!<br/><br/>A hint of contemplation appeared on his face before he disappeared in the next instant.<br/><br/>“He shouldn’t have chased after us. I wonder if he managed to get his hands on the galactic fragment. ”<br/><br/>Xiao Lan flew forward quickly. Lan qingyue glanced at the back and spoke.<br/><br/>“We should be able to get it! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian guessed.<br/><br/>They were already able to block the fragment of the Starfield.<br/><br/>With the strength of an expert at the peak of the Dominator realm, it was sufficient to block the fragment of the Starfield. “Master, that Lord is here.”<br/><br/>At this moment, Xiao Lan suddenly spoke.<br/><br/>Lan Qingyue’s gaze froze. Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly as well.<br/><br/>“The other party doesn’t seem to have any ill intentions. ” However, Wang Xian spoke very quickly.<br/><br/>In front of them, the figure of Hun Dun slowly appeared.<br/><br/>His aura was not that terrifying. He was floating in the void in front of them as he sized up Wang Xian and the rest.<br/><br/>“Greetings, senior Hun Dun. May I know what your orders are?” Upon seeing this, Wang Xian immediately bowed and cupped his hands.<br/><br/>“Greetings, Senior Hundun.”<br/><br/>Lan Qingyue and Xiao Lan also greeted him. “Hehe, Hello, Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Hundun smiled and replied to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Upon hearing his words, Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.<br/><br/>If such an existence wanted to kill him, it would be too easy.<br/><br/>“May I know what is the matter, Senior Hundun? If Our Dragon Palace can do it, we will definitely not decline. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke again.<br/><br/>(‘I heard that there is a treasure in the Dragon Palace. We would like to make a trade with you, Dragon King.”<br/><br/>Hundun’s words caused Wang Xian to reveal a stunned expression.<br/><br/>Trade?<br/><br/>A peak-level ruler, a top-notch existence among the space beasts of the nine-origin universe, wanted to make a trade with the Dragon Palace?<br/><br/>(‘I wonder what Senior Hundun wishes to make a trade with. Compared to our Dragon Palace, I believe that other peak-level races have more treasures to trade with you, right?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said with some doubts in his heart!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
