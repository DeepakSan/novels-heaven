Boom<br/><br/>The 10,000-meter-long spatial sword brought with it a terrifying might as it attacked Yi Ya.<br/><br/>Yi Ya felt the might of the huge sword, and her calm expression finally began to change drastically.<br/><br/>From the 10,000-meter-long sword, she felt a threat of death!<br/><br/>This caused her expression to freeze, and her charging figure immediately stopped. Numerous sharp swords met the 10,000-meter-long sword.<br/><br/>At the same time, her figure flashed, and she directly teleported backwards.<br/><br/>The power of the 10,000-meter-long swords losing control decreased by a lot!<br/><br/>The 10,000-meter-long sword slashed down, directly causing the 10,000-meter-long swords to collapse!<br/><br/>The 10,000-meter-long sword broke through Yi Ya’s attack, and it still attacked her at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>Yi Ya’s expression was incomparably cold when she saw this. She waved her arm, and numerous sword shadows smashed onto it.<br/><br/>The sharp sword that was 10,000 meters long started to crumble slowly.<br/><br/>“That’s it?”<br/><br/>“Kill me in one move?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at Yi Ya who was in front of him and asked indifferently. A hint of mockery appeared on his face.<br/><br/>This lady wasn’t very capable but she was rather arrogant and arrogant.<br/><br/>Kill me in one move?<br/><br/>When Yi Ya heard Wang Xian’s words and saw his mocking expression, she looked extremely embarrassed.<br/><br/>What she said just now was a blatant slap in the face.<br/><br/>“What? Goddess Yi Ya was actually suppressed? How is this possible?”<br/><br/>“No Way. That Wang Xian, who is only at level nine of the eternal swordsman realm, actually made Yi Ya Retreat?”<br/><br/>“Hiss, what’s going on? What kind of sword technique did that young man use? It seems to be very powerful! ”<br/><br/>At the same time, all the students from the Songyi Saint Academy who were watching the battle were shocked by this scene.<br/><br/>Everyone thought that this was an easy battle between goddess Yi Ya.<br/><br/>However, they didn’t expect that not only did they not suppress the other party, they were even pushed back by the other party. This was simply unbelievable!<br/><br/>The teachers from the Songyi Saint Academy looked at Wang Xian’s sword technique with astonishment on their faces.<br/><br/>It was very, very difficult for a person of the same attribute to fight against someone of a higher level.<br/><br/>Especially against someone of the same level like Yi Ya.<br/><br/>“This sword technique?”<br/><br/>The space saint, Wu Qitian, stared at him and adjusted his brows slightly.<br/><br/>“You have completely infuriated me. I want to show you my sword technique, Void Annihilation Sword! ”<br/><br/>Yi Ya stared at Wang Xian with a cold expression. Her eyes revealed a stern look.<br/><br/>He moved his palm and waved the sharp sword in his hand forward. A wave of spatial power rippled.<br/><br/>His figure disappeared instantly!<br/><br/>Wang Xian saw that he was attacking again and a serious look appeared in his eyes.<br/><br/>He stabbed towards one spot and his figure disappeared instantly.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Yi Ya teleported to one spot. The moment she appeared, she sensed an attack heading towards her. This caused her expression to freeze.<br/><br/>“You can actually sense the location of my teleportation?”<br/><br/>She was astonished as she blocked the attack with the sharp sword in her hand.<br/><br/>After blocking the attack, his gaze locked onto Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Void, spare!”<br/><br/>She let out a soft cry. The surroundings trembled as numerous sharp swords surrounded her, forming a terrifying sword storm!<br/><br/>She gripped the sharp sword in her hand tightly as the number of spatial swords around her increased!<br/><br/>Soon, a terrifying spatial sword storm that was tens of thousands of meters in size was formed!<br/><br/>The surrounding void produced strange sounds as the sword of the storm tore through it!<br/><br/>As the storm grew larger, Yi ya circled around the center of the storm. She stared at Wang Xian and flew straight towards him.<br/><br/>Her speed was extremely fast!<br/><br/>“Not bad swordsmanship!”<br/><br/>While Yi Ya was accumulating her strength, Wang Xian was brandishing the sharp sword in his hand continuously!<br/><br/>A large number of sword catacombs had gathered in the surroundings!<br/><br/>The sword catacombs were like seeds that were growing rapidly. They formed many sharp swords that pierced straight into the clouds!<br/><br/>Every sword catacomb that rose up was a terrifying sharp sword!<br/><br/>Slowly, more than ten sharp swords that pierced straight into the clouds appeared in front of Wang Xian and shielded his body.<br/><br/>“Break! ”<br/><br/>When Yi Ya saw these terrifying giant swords piercing through the clouds, her face was filled with a solemn expression.<br/><br/>She didn’t expect that this student who was only at level nine of the eternal swordsman would be able to unleash such a powerful attack.<br/><br/>The attack formed by these terrifying giant swords was already able to threaten her!<br/><br/>However, his void sword storm was also not afraid of his opponent.<br/><br/>She carried the terrifying power of the sword storm and attacked the sharp swords that pierced through the clouds.<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang<br/><br/>A loud collision sound was heard.<br/><br/>The terrifying sword storm continued to kill the giant swords one after another.<br/><br/>These giant swords were collapsing rapidly and turned into the power of space!<br/><br/>“Hehe! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian saw the speed at which the sharp swords were collapsing and a hint of a smile appeared in his eyes.<br/><br/>He waved the sharp sword in his hand rapidly and formed sword mounds.<br/><br/>Sword mounds were formed in front of him quickly.<br/><br/>This time, there were a total of 18 sword mounds formed!<br/><br/>When the 18 sword mounds were formed, the dozens of huge swords in front of him had already been broken!<br/><br/>The sword storm formed by Yi Ya was still there.<br/><br/>He floated in the middle and stared at Wang Xian from above.<br/><br/>“You have exceeded my expectations, but this is the end! ”<br/><br/>Yi Ya’s eyes revealed a cold expression. She controlled the sword storm and continued to attack Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Yes, it’s time to end this! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian watched and waved his arm. The sword catacombs in front of him disappeared quickly.<br/><br/>“Green Peak Sword Formation, Rise! ” Wang Xian shouted in a low voice.<br/><br/>Boom Boom Boom<br/><br/>In an instant, the eighteen sword mounds turned into terrifying sword blades!<br/><br/>Each of the sword blades exuded a terrifying aura!<br/><br/>Most importantly, these eighteen sword blades seemed to form a powerful sword formation!<br/><br/>Clang<br/><br/>Clang<br/><br/>The eighteen sword blades surrounded Yi Ya in the middle, accompanied by the cold sound of Sharp Swords.<br/><br/>A terrifying sharp sword condensed in the air above the eighteen sword edges!<br/><br/>The sharp sword directly attacked Yi Ya!<br/><br/>“What is this? How is this possible?”<br/><br/>The sudden sword edge and the sudden sharp sword in the air made Yi Ya reveal a trace of fear on her face!<br/><br/>He felt the power of this sharp sword, and his body trembled violently.<br/><br/>Sword Storm! ”<br/><br/>She raised the sword in her hand, and the storm spun toward the sword above her.<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>Everyone heard a violent explosion.<br/><br/>All the students’faces were filled with shock.<br/><br/>The sword fell from the sky, and the storm surged up into the sky.<br/><br/>However, the eighteen sword edges around them slowly emitted a luster, and waves of energy were injected into them.<br/><br/>The entire sword storm was slowly suppressed.<br/><br/>“Bang Bang Bang! ”<br/><br/>The sound of a sharp sword breaking was heard continuously, and the sharp sword that fell from the sky did not weaken at all. Instead, it became stronger and stronger!<br/><br/>When Yi Ya, who was inside, saw this scene, her expression changed drastically!<br/><br/>Her face was filled with unwillingness and fear.<br/><br/>Faced with this move, she actually had no way of dealing with it.. She might even be killed!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
