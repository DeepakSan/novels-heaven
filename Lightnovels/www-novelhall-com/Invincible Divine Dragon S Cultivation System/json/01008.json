One could imagine how terrifying this place was. Of course, this could be related to the plan of the two Heaven’s origin creator powerhouses in the sword and magic universe, or it could be due to some special reasons. They had yet to destroy this place!<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he listened to the words of the powerhouses in the unfettered forbidden land and flowing water forbidden land.<br/><br/>This place was indeed a good place for training!<br/><br/>There were dangers, but there were also many opportunities.<br/><br/>This place was stained with the blood of the heaven origin creator. The limbs of the heaven origin creator that had once fallen were definitely filled with many treasures at the same time as the birth of Demonic Beasts!<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s actual body had already broken through to the sixth level of the universe dominator. He was not afraid at all here!<br/><br/>Perhaps, he would be able to obtain a large amount of resources!<br/><br/>Perhaps, he would be able to improve once again!<br/><br/>“Alright, in the next few billion years, we will open up an area in Tianyuan city. It will be used for the residence, healing, trading, and sparring of all the strong disciples who are participating in the battle. We will strive to produce more strong cultivators in our sword and Magic Universe. ”<br/><br/>“All Forbidden Lands and sacred academies, Go and prepare. In ten years, prepare for War! ”<br/><br/>The medicine ancestor of the undeserved forbidden land continued to give orders!<br/><br/>The experts of the forbidden lands and sacred academies immediately replied!<br/><br/>They would not go against the orders of the two forbidden lands.<br/><br/>The reason why they were able to establish the forbidden lands and sacred academies was because of the good fortune of the two forbidden lands, allowing them to develop as they pleased.<br/><br/>If not, the universe would divide the two forbidden grounds.<br/><br/>As for the undeserved forbidden grounds and flowing water forbidden grounds, the rest of the forbidden grounds and the sacred academy were filled with respect!<br/><br/>“Little Xian, Yin Yinhao, don ‘t follow us back to the dragon roar forbidden ground for now. Stay here in Tian Yuan city and cultivate properly! ”<br/><br/>The two experts from the forbidden grounds finished their instructions.<br/><br/>The Patriarch of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground looked at Wang Xian and the rest as he spoke with a twinkle in his eyes!<br/><br/>“Oh? Patriarch, Why?”<br/><br/>Long Yinhao was slightly taken aback as he asked in astonishment.<br/><br/>“I have a few enemies. Furthermore, many experts from the forbidden grounds and Saint Academy are jealous of you. In order to prevent any accidents, all of you can stay in Tian Yuan city. Tian Yuan city is very safe. With the magic array of Lord creation of Tian Yuan, there won’t be any problems. ”<br/><br/>The forefather of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Land said, he patted long<br/><br/>Yinhao’s head and said, “Yinhao, cultivate well. The future of our dragon roar forbidden land depends on you. Hehe, Pm very happy. When I step into the Demon Beast Abyss to train, I have to be careful to prevent people from doing bad things.”<br/><br/>“Yes, forefather!”<br/><br/>Long Yinhao immediately replied!<br/><br/>“Little Xian, you too, especially you. As long as you don’t die, you will definitely be a top-notch expert in our universe in the future. You have to be careful. ”<br/><br/>The elder of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground looked at Wang Xian and said, “You have obtained a large number of treasures and opportunities. Pm afraid that some people will be envious! ”<br/><br/>“I know, I will be careful! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and said with a smile.<br/><br/>“Hehe, good, good! ”<br/><br/>The forefather of the dragon roar forbidden ground nodded with a smile.<br/><br/>Long Yinhao’s father and grandfather didn’t leave. Instead, they brought Wang Xian, Long Yinhao, and the rest to Tianyuan City for a stroll.<br/><br/>They brought them to eat some delicacies and the like!<br/><br/>Now, Long Yinhao’s father and grandfather were exceptionally passionate towards Wang Xian!<br/><br/>They also knew that Wang Xian’s identity was a little mysterious. Furthermore, he said that he would leave the dragon roar forbidden ground after the outbreak of the quantum calamity!<br/><br/>However, all of this was no longer important!<br/><br/>Since Wang Xian was able to give such a terrifying opportunity to the dragon roar, what more could they ask for?<br/><br/>This opportunity could not be exchanged even if they sold the entire Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground!<br/><br/>Wang Xian was unusually courteous to the Dragon Roar’s elders.<br/><br/>In the following period of time, he completely relaxed!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the entire sword and magic universe was preparing to clean up the abyss of Demonic Beasts!<br/><br/>In the Void Dragon Forbidden Ground, Wang Xian didn’t allow them to show themselves because they had been attacked by some experts previously.<br/><br/>However, this time around, Wang Xian was prepared to let some disciples of the Dragon Palace participate in the matter of eliminating the abyss of demonic beasts so that they could undergo a trial.<br/><br/>In addition, the demonic beasts he hunted could also be considered as an opportunity!<br/><br/>In addition, he also wanted to see which sacred ground and sacred academy were the ones who had secretly attacked the Void Dragon Forbidden Ground! If they continued to attack, Wang Xian would definitely make them pay a price!<br/><br/>The current void Dragon forbidden ground was not weak.<br/><br/>Ao Jian and the rest had also received considerable improvements after such a long period of time.<br/><br/>This was especially so for Ao Jian. After absorbing the corpses of the powerhouses in the demon pillar, coupled with his heart of faith, his breakthrough speed was also very fast.<br/><br/>It might not be long before he reached the universe ruler Level 5!<br/><br/>The rest of the Dragon Guards were all at the universe ruler level 3 or 4! Other than the dragon guards, the strongest ones at the moment were ao crab and the others.<br/><br/>Ao crab was still in the universe ruins, devouring the Divine Kingdom of a peak universe ruler!<br/><br/>After devouring for nearly 100 million years, ao Crab’s strength had already reached the level eight of the Universe Dominator!<br/><br/>Of course, because Ao crab belonged to the devouring dragon, although he was at the level eight of the universe dominator, his combat strength was only on par with the level seven of the Universe Dominator!<br/><br/>However, the strongest point of the devouring dragon was the Sea of people tactic!<br/><br/>The Divine Kingdom of the peak of the universe dominator would be able to give birth to more than ten universe Dominators at the level nine of the universe dominator. It would not be a problem!<br/><br/>Ten years passed very quickly!<br/><br/>On this day, the Patriarch of the dragon roar forbidden ground called Wang Xian and the other two and flew towards a direction in Tian Yuan city.<br/><br/>Tian Yuan city was very big. During these ten years, the unfettered forbidden ground, flowing water forbidden ground, had opened up a territory in Tian Yuan city. It was used to clean up the cultivation grounds of the abyss of Demonic Beasts.<br/><br/>Moreover, the teleportation formations leading to the abyss of Magical Beasts had also been built there!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
