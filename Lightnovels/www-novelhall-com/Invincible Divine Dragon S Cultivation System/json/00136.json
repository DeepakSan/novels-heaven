Its entire body was covered in dragon scales, and it was full of majesty.<br/><br/>There was a hint of unwillingness in its eyes.<br/><br/>It wasn’t an ordinary sky halberd dragon.<br/><br/>It had the noble bloodline of a divine dragon. Its ancestor was a peak powerhouse in the universe and a powerful dragon that had fought for the pure-blooded divine dragon.<br/><br/>However, it was given to others as a gift by other dragon species and used as a mount.<br/><br/>The island quickly flew towards the volcano region.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>The volcano region, the land of the main Dragon Palace. After the Dragon Palace was transferred here and announced on the Milky Way, the members of the Dragon Palace began to modify the area around the volcano region.<br/><br/>First of all, as the base of the Dragon Palace for the next period of time, it couldn’t be so chaotic. It had to be full of grandeur and majesty.<br/><br/>The leaders of the Dragon Palace, who were at the level of venerables, moved the volcanoes and created majestic and vast domains.<br/><br/>Prime Minister Turtle even ordered the Warriors of the Dragon Palace to condense the volcanoes into the shape of dragons.<br/><br/>The Flaming Mountains of the Dragons looked magnificent from afar.<br/><br/>The sky array started to set up large arrays in the surroundings. Now that the sky array had the strength of a level 2 knight, it set up all kinds of powerful arrays in the surroundings of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Even if a level 2 knight came here to cause trouble, the array could kill him instantly.<br/><br/>After all, after breaking through the sky array, he could fight at least three beings of the same level.<br/><br/>If he set up the array in his own territory, he could unleash even more terrifying power.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace had more than 20 universe knights, and it was very easy to change the volcano region.<br/><br/>However, it would take some time to set up the array in the sky array.<br/><br/>It would take at least a few months to complete it.<br/><br/>All the members in the Dragon Palace were excited.<br/><br/>With the power of the Dragon Palace, they would have more confidence.<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace should be down there.”<br/><br/>On an island floating above the volcano region of the Milky Way, Lou Shan Knight looked down and said.<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>A group of middle-aged men looked at it from the side. With his strength, he couldn’t sense it at all.<br/><br/>“Hua La!”<br/><br/>Venerable Lou Shan waved his arm, and the entire island fell into the Milky Way and flew down quickly.<br/><br/>“HMM? What a magnificent Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>When they quickly approached the bottom of the Milky Way, the people on the island looked around.<br/><br/>The divine dragons that stretched for tens of thousands of miles, that majestic aura.<br/><br/>And that Majestic Dragon Palace, it made them full of surprise.<br/><br/>“It’s rumored that the divine dragons like treasures, I don’t know if it’s true or not, but the domain of the Heavenly Dragon Race is also very imposing, even more imposing than here.”<br/><br/>A middle-aged man said with a smile.<br/><br/>“More and more Asian dragons returning to their ancestors and establishing the divine dragon lineage, maybe the divine dragon lineage can return to the peak of the universe.”<br/><br/>An old man holding a strange ancient zither said with a smile.<br/><br/>“It’s basically impossible to return to the pinnacle of the universe. The current pinnacle races of the universe, which one of them hasn’t experienced many tribulations? There are already many tribulations that haven’t given birth to a pinnacle race of the universe.”<br/><br/>Lou Shan Knight said slowly.<br/><br/>The people beside him immediately listened respectfully.<br/><br/>“The current Dragon God lineage can only be called the Asian dragon lineage.”<br/><br/>As venerable Lou Shan spoke, his gaze swept forward.<br/><br/>“Who are you?”<br/><br/>At this moment, the two sea patrolling yakshas noticed them and immediately flew over, asking them.<br/><br/>“Third level divine emperor, quite weak.”<br/><br/>The youth riding on the Heavenly Halberd Dragon horse swept past the two sea patrolling yakshas and said indifferently.<br/><br/>The few middle-aged elders beside him nodded in agreement.<br/><br/>They were indeed a little weak, only at the third level of Emperor God realm.<br/><br/>“We are from the ancient painting sect, we are here to pay a visit to the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Lou Shan Knight said lightly.<br/><br/>“You guys wait here, we will go report.”<br/><br/>One of the Yakshas said, his body moved and immediately flew towards the Dragon Palace behind.<br/><br/>“The people from the Dragon Palace are a little lacking in manners. Our deputy sect leader is a universe knight, not only did he not show any respect to a universe knight, he even made us wait here.”<br/><br/>The old man holding the zither frowned and transmitted his voice with displeasure.<br/><br/>“I heard that they have just advanced to the universe primary race. I think they were just lucky to obtain the treasure of Crescent Knight.”<br/><br/>A middle-aged man replied.<br/><br/>Lou Shan Knight stood on the island and looked at the Dragon Palace without saying anything.<br/><br/>However, looking at the Dragon Palace in front of him, his eyes revealed a trace of contempt.<br/><br/>According to his senses, he could easily break through the defense of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The current Dragon Palace had not been upgraded. It could only withstand attacks from those below the venerable one. It had no resistance against the venerable one.<br/><br/>In his heart, venerable Lou Shan had already made a basic judgment of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“HMM? Why are the experts from the ancient painting sect here?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly when he received the report from the members of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>He moved his body and walked out immediately.<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui was also at the side.<br/><br/>“Everyone from the ancient art sect has arrived. Sorry for not welcoming you.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew out of the Dragon Palace and looked at the group of people who had arrived. His gaze landed on venerable Lou Shan as he greeted them with a smile.<br/><br/>“This is?”<br/><br/>Venerable Lou Shan looked at Wang Xian with curiosity in his eyes.<br/><br/>“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian cupped his hands and said, “Venerable Lou Shan, right? This way please.”<br/><br/>He made a welcoming gesture and led them to a seat at the side.<br/><br/>In front of the Dragon Palace, they had specially set up a palace to receive guests.<br/><br/>“This Dragon King of the Dragon Palace seems to be the person wanted by the dragon race.”<br/><br/>At this moment, the young man riding on the Heavenly Halberd Dragon horse at the back suddenly transmitted his voice.<br/><br/>“Yes, it’s true. It seems that the Dragon Palace has a grudge with the dragon-descendant race here in the Milky Way.”<br/><br/>The other middle-aged elders nodded slightly.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, you guys are really amazing. You actually obtained Venerable Crescent Moon’s treasure. Haha, we paid a huge price to compete for that battle Angel.”<br/><br/>Venerable Lou Shan walked beside Wang Xian and said politely.<br/><br/>“I’m just lucky. May I know why you guys are here in the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled. He entered the palace and gestured to them to sit down.<br/><br/>“It’s nothing much. We rushed over to the Milky Way and were planning to stay here for a few days. We happened to see the Dragon Palace announcing that they are of the divine dragon lineage. We were curious and came over to take a look.”<br/><br/>“Our ancient painting sect has a good relationship with the Divine Dragon Clan, so we were curious and wanted to see for ourselves.”<br/><br/>Venerable Lou Shan said with a smile.<br/><br/>He wanted to be polite and say that he wanted to make friends with them, but he changed his story when he heard Tian Zi’s voice transmission.<br/><br/>He didn’t come here to participate in the fight in the Milky Way.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
