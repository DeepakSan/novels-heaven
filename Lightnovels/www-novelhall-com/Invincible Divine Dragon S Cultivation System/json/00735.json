Whoosh! Whoosh!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was flying rapidly above the ocean.<br/><br/>The depths of the ocean in the land of mountains and seas could be said to be one of the most dangerous places in the universe.<br/><br/>This place was a paradise for the space beasts and the terrifying desolate beasts. There were a large number of terrifying existences here.<br/><br/>It could be said that the number of terrifying desolate beasts and space beasts in the land of mountains and seas was comparable to the number of peak species.<br/><br/>This was a forbidden area for other powerhouses.<br/><br/>It was a paradise for space behemoths and desolate beasts.<br/><br/>However, at this moment, there were not many powerful sea creatures in the surroundings. One could not even see the shadow of space behemoths.<br/><br/>Initially, the interior of the mountain and sea region would give people a feeling of fear. However, it had completely disappeared now.<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew towards the interior. Occasionally, he could see some powerhouses’disciples from other races flying towards the depths.<br/><br/>There were groups of them. Clearly, there were still many strong people who wanted to go and take a look.<br/><br/>After flying for a few days, Wang Xian suddenly felt a change in the aura in front of him.<br/><br/>A group of empty and barbaric auras came charging at him.<br/><br/>This aura was different from the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and continued flying forward. After flying for another day, towering mountains appeared one after another.<br/><br/>Each mountain stood in the middle of the ocean with a strong pressure.<br/><br/>The mountains were covered with trees and looked very ancient!<br/><br/>“That is!”<br/><br/>At this moment, he looked ahead with a shocked expression.<br/><br/>What he saw was a very shocking and strange place.<br/><br/>The space contained space, as if two worlds overlapped.<br/><br/>A huge void suddenly appeared from within, and the area was extremely huge.<br/><br/>And in the surrounding area, there were already countless experts’disciples gathered.<br/><br/>Flying Phoenixes.<br/><br/>The dark race shrouded in darkness.<br/><br/>The Majestic Divine Tiger.<br/><br/>The bamboo hat shrouded the mysterious wizard.<br/><br/>The angel flapping its wings.<br/><br/>The immortal nation in the illusory palace above.<br/><br/>The saint’s disciple stepping on the clouds, holding a feather fan and a book.<br/><br/>The black tortoise with a thick black shell.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Groups of powerhouses from the peak races gathered at the entrance of this world.<br/><br/>And around the entrance, there were many powerhouses’disciples from the high-level races from the Heaven Opening and Primal Continent.<br/><br/>They looked at this scene with shock on their faces.<br/><br/>Besides them, there was another eye-catching race in the center.<br/><br/>Below that race, there was an extremely huge space battleship. The entire space battleship was the size of a few stars.<br/><br/>Countless flying machines flew towards the unknown world.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked over. His eyes were sparkling. His body moved and he approached the entrance.<br/><br/>“The passageway between our universe and the space universe has just opened. Even the experts from the peak races do not dare to enter recklessly.”<br/><br/>“The Starry Universe is the birthplace of the space beasts. If one were to encounter a terrifying space beast suddenly after entering, one would not even know how they died!”<br/><br/>“The scientists from the technological world are analyzing the characteristics of the starry universe. The peak races are also waiting for their data.”<br/><br/>“Let’s not talk about other things. Some of the high-tech technologies in the technological world are indeed very powerful in terms of exploration. It is much safer than using disciples to explore.”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian approached, he heard a group of strong disciples conversing.<br/><br/>He swept his gaze around and sized up his surroundings. He did not enter or get too close.<br/><br/>Everyone was waiting and stood there quietly. The strong disciples around them were discussing non-stop.<br/><br/>On the side of the peak races, they seemed to be waiting for some news as well.<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. Five days later, a figure wearing a mech flew out from the battleship in the middle.<br/><br/>“My Lords, our technology world’s flying machine has already penetrated tens of thousands of light years into the starry universe. According to our analysis, in the starry universe, the metal, wood, water, fire, Earth, wind, thunder, light, and darkness attributes are 20% less than in our 9-origin universe.”<br/><br/>“The starry universe has a very strong repulsive force towards the living beings of our 9-origin universe, suppressing them by at least three levels. Other than that, we can already confirm that we can sense our god country from there, but we can’t instantly return to the god country.”<br/><br/>“Also, we didn’t find any danger in the surroundings. The universe’s AI can not be used. The starry universe contains energy that our 9-origin universe doesn’t have. Our robots have found some fruits. After our analysis, many of the fruits have extremely useful effects on the physical body. The special energy has great benefits for the living beings of our 9-origin universe.”<br/><br/>“In addition, the resources there are indeed more abundant. Many of the divine fruits with attributes have not been devoured by the space beasts in the starry universe. It might not be to their liking.”<br/><br/>The mech from the technological world reported to a group of experts from the peak races.<br/><br/>The voice spread throughout the surroundings, and all the powerful disciples in the surroundings could hear it clearly.<br/><br/>“Suppressing three levels, this suppression is too strong. Even the experts of the peak races can not fight beyond their levels. When our high-level races enter, their combat strength will be suppressed by one level.”<br/><br/>“We can’t return to our own divine kingdom in an instant. The danger will increase greatly, and the death rate will be very high.”<br/><br/>“But the scientists in the technological world also said that there are very rich resources there. They can improve the physical body, and there are even many fruits of various attributes.”<br/><br/>The powerful disciples of the high-ranked races were discussing in shock.<br/><br/>Some of the powerful ones were somewhat apprehensive and afraid.<br/><br/>They could not return to their own divine kingdoms. The danger was too great!<br/><br/>“Disciples of the Magus lineage, explore new worlds and come into contact with new knowledge. We will not give in!”<br/><br/>Over at the Magus lineage, an old man with an extremely pale face and dressed in black magus attire spoke indifferently. His figure moved and disappeared in an instant.<br/><br/>At the position behind him, the Wizards stepped into the starry sky without any hesitation.<br/><br/>There were tens of thousands of wizards from the Wizards’side who stepped into the starry sky.<br/><br/>The number of wizards from the Wizard’s side was very small to begin with. It was already very high for tens of thousands of wizards to enter.<br/><br/>Wang Xian could vaguely sense that the first wizard who stepped into the starry sky should be at the third or fourth level of the Universe Dominator.<br/><br/>At present, the information of the starry universe was still unclear. Clearly, the powerhouses who entered first were not too strong.<br/><br/>“Celestial Nation’s Celestial Buddha, let’s Go!”<br/><br/>At the Celestial Nation’s branch, a bald old man with a huge Buddha statue on his head shouted softly and flew in as well.<br/><br/>The celestial nation’s branch had more than 100,000 strong disciples who entered.<br/><br/>One by one, the peak races entered. However, there were some powerhouses at the entrance of each peak race.<br/><br/>They floated there as if they were waiting for the return of their clansmen. It was also as if they were waiting for the transmission of information.<br/><br/>“Hehe, I can feel the aura of the Divine Dragon. Hehe.”<br/><br/>At this moment, a handsome twelve-winged angel stood at the front of the angel race. He slowly looked towards Wang Xian’s position.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
