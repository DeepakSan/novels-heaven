Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>The Violent Thundermale Ape attacked Wang Xian with all its might.<br/><br/>Its entire body was drenched in blood. Its eyes were filled with madness as its ferocity was unleashed.<br/><br/>Unlike the Purple Thundersnake King’s pleas for mercy, its entire body seemed to be boiling as it fought with all its might!<br/><br/>“Die!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian let out a low roar as his dragon claws landed heavily on its body. The destructive force caused its body to tremble violently as it slowly fell to the ground.<br/><br/>The Five Elements Millstone followed closely and suppressed its body, completely destroying it.<br/><br/>A thunder male ape at the peak of the Universe Knight realm was not even a match for the Purple Thunder Snake King in a one-on-one fight, let alone Wang Xian and the rest.<br/><br/>This was because the Thunder Male Ape’s nest was here. It could not escape and was easily killed.<br/><br/>In less than five minutes.<br/><br/>“Let’s go to its nest and take a look!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian scanned the Thunder Male Ape’s corpse and kept it with a wave of his arm. Then, he moved and entered the Thunder Male Ape’s nest.<br/><br/>“Eh, its nest has quite a number of treasures. There are also a few acquired treasures!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes glowed as he entered.<br/><br/>There were some eighth or ninth level universe knight fruits, three acquired treasures with lightning attributes, and more than a dozen acquired spiritual treasures.<br/><br/>There were many more acquired spiritual treasures in the old dynasty than the Purple Thunder Snake King.<br/><br/>“Not bad, not bad. The harvest this time is not bad.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian had a satisfied look on his face. The Thunder Male Ape’s corpse could increase the strength of the Heaven Array.<br/><br/>These divine fruits could also increase Wang Xian’s strength by a lot.<br/><br/>Moreover, these acquired treasures could be sold in exchange for a lot of resources.<br/><br/>“It’s been almost a year since I came out. I have to go back!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian packed up the treasures and stood at the top of the mountain peak. He looked at the time and muttered with a smile.<br/><br/>He had gained a lot in a year’s time.<br/><br/>Buzz Buzz<br/><br/>At this moment, his universe intelligence brain trembled. He opened it and saw that it was a message from Lei Zhengyun, Lei Yunzi and the rest.<br/><br/>The celebration of the eldest senior brother of the Thunder race would be held soon.<br/><br/>This celebration was a major event for the disciples of the Thunder race.<br/><br/>There were no special circumstances during the celebration of the eldest senior brother of the Thunder race. All the disciples had to be present. At that time, the elders and deacons of the race would also rush over.<br/><br/>“Let’s go back!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the Purple Thunder Snake King beside him and waved his arm.<br/><br/>“Hiss! Hiss!”<br/><br/>The Purple Lightning Snake King let out a cry and entered the mother nest.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s body moved and flew in the direction of the Lightning race.<br/><br/>As he flew in the thunderclouds, Wang Xian’s flight was somewhat unrestrained.<br/><br/>The clan leader, Supreme Elder, and the rest of the lightning race might not dare to fly in such an unrestrained manner.<br/><br/>Ten days later, Wang Xian arrived in front of the territory of the Lightning race. He lowered his speed to conceal his other attributes.<br/><br/>He reverted back to his status as the eldest senior brother.<br/><br/>However, how would the disciples of the Thunder Ray race know that their eldest senior brother went out this time and subdued a desolate beast at the peak of the universe knight level, killing a desolate beast at the peak of the Universe Knight Level?<br/><br/>If this was known by the Thunder Ray race, the entire race would be in an uproar.<br/><br/>Thinking of this, he smiled and continued to fly in.<br/><br/>When he arrived at the teleportation formation, he teleported directly to the mountain peak where the disciples of the Lightning race lived.<br/><br/>When he returned to the palace, Wang Xian informed Lei Zhengyun, Lei Yunzi, and the other girls about his return.<br/><br/>In the Lightning race, he was considered to have a better relationship with these girls. Of course, this was only limited to the few times he interacted with them.<br/><br/>“Three more days!”<br/><br/>He looked at the time of the celebration banquet and laid on the bed to rest.<br/><br/>This time, he went out for nearly a year without a day of rest. He habitually slept for a while.<br/><br/>“Eldest senior brother!”<br/><br/>Ten hours later, the sound of shouting came from outside.<br/><br/>Wang Xian opened his eyes and stretched.<br/><br/>“Come in!”<br/><br/>He said and walked into the main hall to prepare some tea.<br/><br/>“Eldest senior brother, you are really hardworking in your cultivation. You are already so strong, yet you still cultivate in seclusion every day!”<br/><br/>Outside, fourth senior sister, Lei Zhengyun, Lei Yunzi, and a few other girls came in. They were all smiling as they spoke to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“No, I went to the Thunderclouds to train. I just came back. Have a seat!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian glanced at them and smiled faintly.<br/><br/>“Eldest senior brother, your celebration banquet is about to begin. We have helped you arrange it. If there’s anything you need, we can help you settle it!”<br/><br/>Fourth senior sister spoke to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>In the thunderlight race, the eldest senior brother of each generation would have many disciples who worshipped and followed him.<br/><br/>In addition, he had the authority to command the other disciples. The disciples would help him settle the basic matters.<br/><br/>“There’s no need for that. You guys can just do as you see fit.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said nonchalantly. He didn’t have much of a change in his identity as the eldest senior brother of the Lightning race.<br/><br/>“Oh right, do you need me to do anything for the celebration banquet?”<br/><br/>He asked.<br/><br/>“Under normal circumstances, the eldest senior brother would give some pointers to the disciples and impart some cultivation tips. There’s nothing else.”<br/><br/>Fourth senior sister replied.<br/><br/>“Alright, Alright!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head slightly and looked at the eight female disciples of the Lightning race in front of him.<br/><br/>“Your Luck is pretty good this time. I’ve caught a few Thundercloud vultures. I’ll give one to each of you!”<br/><br/>As he spoke, he waved his arm and eight Thundercloud vultures appeared in front of him.<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>“Thundercloud Vultures? Eldest senior brother, this…”<br/><br/>Lei Zheng, Lei Yun Zi and the other girls were stunned and looked at the Thundercloud vultures in shock.<br/><br/>The eight Thundercloud vultures corresponded to their current levels of cultivation.<br/><br/>There was even a universe knight level 7 Thundercloud Vulture.<br/><br/>They lay there motionless, obviously completely suppressed.<br/><br/>They only needed to spend time or ask the elders to help them subdue them.<br/><br/>In the heaven opening primal continent, there was no need for a Special Beast Tamer to tame war pets.<br/><br/>That was because they could use their powerful bloodlines and physiques to suppress the beasts.<br/><br/>In the past, the reason why Wang Xian could easily tame dire beasts was also due to the Divine Dragon bloodline.<br/><br/>“The Thunder Cloud Vulture with the combat strength of a universe knight at level seven. Eldest senior brother, you… You can actually suppress a beast of such a level. That’s Amazing!”<br/><br/>Fourth senior sister looked at the Thunder Cloud Vulture with a face full of shock. She felt a little incredulous.<br/><br/>To capture a level 7 thunder cloud vulture of a universe knight, one would need at least the strength of a Level 9 universe knight.<br/><br/>However, eldest senior brother was actually able to suppress it. Eldest senior brother’s strength had become amazing again?<br/><br/>“Wow, this thunder cloud vulture and my strength are just right. Eldest senior brother, you’re too good, too good!”<br/><br/>Lei Zhengyun cheered excitedly.<br/><br/>The Thundercloud Vulture was the mount that she yearned for a long time ago. She didn’t expect Wang Xian to give it to her.<br/><br/>“Thank you, eldest senior brother! Thank you, eldest senior brother!”<br/><br/>Lei Yunzi and the other girls also thanked him excitedly.<br/><br/>The Thundercloud Vulture Mount!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
