Sir, sir…”<br/><br/>Below, when the first elder of the flowing water forbidden land heard this, their bodies trembled violently.<br/><br/>Their faces were filled with despair and fear!<br/><br/>They shouted at Liu Lan with faces full of Panic!<br/><br/>Their faces were filled with begging.<br/><br/>Their hearts were filled with fear!<br/><br/>“Don’t make me say it again. I built the flowing water forbidden land to protect the entire universe. If the sword and the magic universe suffered heavy losses because of you, then the flowing water forbidden land would no longer have a need to exist! ”<br/><br/>Liu Lan gritted her teeth!<br/><br/>This matter was originally handled poorly by the experts of the flowing water forbidden ground!<br/><br/>At this time, if the entire sword and magic universe faced the danger of extinction because of some of the higher-ups and experts of the flowing water forbidden ground!<br/><br/>Then the entire flowing water forbidden ground would be a sinner!<br/><br/>Then what was the need for the flowing water forbidden ground that she built?<br/><br/>Liu Lan’s expression was incomparably cold as her gaze swept over all the strong disciples of the Flowing Water Forbidden Ground! “Why? How could this be? How could this be?”<br/><br/>At the side, Liu Shui Hao Lian was completely stunned!<br/><br/>He couldn’t believe what he saw, he couldn’t believe his own ending!<br/><br/>He never would have thought that just because he led people to attack long Yinhao,.<br/><br/>He had actually caused the destruction of the entire forbidden space. He had also caused his grandfather, the master of the flowing water forbidden ground, to face death!<br/><br/>This was something he had never expected!<br/><br/>This made him feel shocked!<br/><br/>He felt terrified!<br/><br/>“Sir, we are sinners, we are sinners! ”<br/><br/>At a side seat, the second elder of the flowing water forbidden ground heard Liu Lan’s words, and his face was filled with bitterness!<br/><br/>He slapped his body with his palm and his life force dissipated rapidly!<br/><br/>Second Elder! ”<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, an expert from the flowing water forbidden ground shouted in a low voice!<br/><br/>The second elder of the flowing water forbidden ground had committed suicide!<br/><br/>When everyone saw this scene, they were shocked!<br/><br/>However, everything that happened today was too shocking!<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s terrifying strength!<br/><br/>The sudden appearance of the Asgard Heavenly Demon God!<br/><br/>Especially the Asgard Heavenly Demon God. He was the mortal enemy of their sword and Magic Universe!<br/><br/>Next, their sword and magic universe would probably face a disaster!<br/><br/>Now, the death of the second elder of the flowing water forbidden ground was actually insignificant!<br/><br/>“You brought this upon yourself. You can bully others if you are strong, but once others have a stronger background, you will be the one to die. It’s very fair!<br/><br/>A peak universe ruler expert from the unfettered forbidden land said!<br/><br/>If you’re strong, you can kill without being held responsible!<br/><br/>However, if others were strong, then if they dared to kill, then the price they would have to pay would be very heavy!<br/><br/>This was something that everyone understood!<br/><br/>The death of the second elder of the flowing water forbidden land was something that they had no choice but to do!<br/><br/>This was because the other party was very strong!<br/><br/>“Hehehe, hopeless sky, flowing blue, my revenge is about to begin! hehehe! ”<br/><br/>At this moment, in front of them, the Asgard Heavenly Demon God roared with an unbridled expression!<br/><br/>He flapped his wings and violent bone spikes floated behind him!<br/><br/>They attacked them indiscriminately!<br/><br/>They attacked directly!<br/><br/>This agar heavenly demon god did not hesitate at all.<br/><br/>He attacked with a killing move!<br/><br/>He was naturally no match for hopeless sky and Liu Lan alone.<br/><br/>However, his goal was not to kill Hopeless Sky and Liu Lan.<br/><br/>Instead, it was to kill the experts and living beings in the sword and magic universe.<br/><br/>He wanted the sword and magic universe to be plunged into misery, and blood would flow like a river!<br/><br/>He was also confident that the chances of Liu Lan and hopeless sky wanting to keep him and kill him were very, very small!<br/><br/>When it came to the Heavenly Yuan creation, killing one of the two would require a suppression in strength.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it would be too difficult to kill a heavenly yuan creation.<br/><br/>“Damn it, agartian, this time, I’m going to kill you completely! ”<br/><br/>When Hopeless Heaven saw Agartian’s attack, his eyes turned blood-red.<br/><br/>He raised the golden battle axe in his hand and slashed at him.<br/><br/>Golden light enveloped the entire world.<br/><br/>It slashed directly at agar!<br/><br/>When Liu Lan saw this scene, his expression changed slightly.<br/><br/>With a move of his hand, a staff appeared in his hand.<br/><br/>He waved the staff forward and a water curtain enveloped everyone!<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, all the powerful disciples instantly felt the pressure relax!<br/><br/>They breathed heavily.<br/><br/>In a battle of this level, even if there was the slightest ripple, they would die instantly.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Heaven’s fate was too terrifying.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I hope that we can forget about what happened between us. To express my apologies, after this battle, I will gift you the Heaven’s fate fragment, a part of the book of Water Forbidden Spell! ”<br/><br/>Liu Lan looked at Wang Xian. With a wave of her arm, a book of water forbidden spell appeared in front of her. “I will definitely believe what I say!”<br/><br/>She said to Wang Xian with a serious face!<br/><br/>“Alright, as long as you give me a satisfactory answer, I will not take action.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian replied!<br/><br/>He looked at the location in front of him!<br/><br/>The Heaven’s origin creation in the unfettered forbidden land had no hope of striking towards the Asgard Heavenly Demon God!<br/><br/>However, the Asgard Heavenly Demon God did not confront him head-on. Instead, he kept dodging.<br/><br/>He continued to unleash long-range attacks!<br/><br/>Streams of energy swept over in this direction!<br/><br/>If not for flowing Blue’s defense, this place would have been reduced to ruins!<br/><br/>Of all the people here, only the level 9 universe ruler and peak ruler realm experts would be able to survive!<br/><br/>Hopeless Sky’s strength was extremely terrifying.<br/><br/>The golden battle axe slashed forward, and the golden light directly split open the void, forming a terrifying galaxy!<br/><br/>“Agartian, if you have the guts, Let’s face it head-on! ”<br/><br/>Wangtian saw Agartian constantly dodging, and his eyes were cold as he shouted loudly!<br/><br/>“Keke, Wangtian, do you think I would be as stupid as you? Next, I, Agartian, will become the nightmare of your sword and Magic Universe. I will continue to attack, Hunt, and suck the flesh and blood of your sword and Magic Universe!”<br/><br/>“Kekeke, from now on, I Will Destroy Your Sword and Magic Universe! ”<br/><br/>He roared with a ghastly face and laughed maniacally!<br/><br/>There was no chance for him to fight with Wangtian head-on.<br/><br/>He would not let Liu Lan and Wangtian completely surround and entangle him!<br/><br/>When Wangtian and Liu Lan heard his words, their bodies trembled violently.<br/><br/>Their expressions were unusually grave and awkward!<br/><br/>Even their breathing was somewhat hurried!<br/><br/>The two of them had the confidence to suppress the Asgardian demon god, but they did not have the confidence to kill him completely. Once he continued to flee and wreak havoc in their universe.<br/><br/>They had no way out either!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
