The words ‘Heavenly Dragon Peak’were carved on it, and it contained an endless pressure.<br/><br/>The rise of the entire Heavenly Dragon tribe was very short. It was all thanks to the Heavenly Dragon King that they were able to reach their current stage.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest were floating in the sky above the Heavenly Dragon Peak. Their eyes were sparkling.<br/><br/>“I wonder what is the current situation of that fellow, the Heavenly Dragon King. Is He Dead or has he escaped? What a pity that the leader of a primary race in the universe is just a chess piece.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled to himself. His body moved and he immediately flew towards the area below.<br/><br/>“All of you go and check the surroundings to prevent the Heavenly Dragon tribe from taking away the treasures here.”<br/><br/>“Also, Sky Formation, go and check the divine kingdom here and find the divine kingdom of the experts of the Heavenly Dragon Tribe.”<br/><br/>He ordered them one by one.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The members of the Dragon Palace nodded.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s body moved and landed in the ocean below.<br/><br/>There was a dragon palace located below. This was the Dragon Palace of the Heavenly Dragon tribe.<br/><br/>The appearance of the Heavenly Dragon Palace was almost identical to that of the Heavenly Sea Dragon Palace. He moved his body and forcefully barged in.<br/><br/>“Who is it that barged into the Dragon Palace without permission? You are courting death!”<br/><br/>Just as he entered the Dragon Palace, a cold voice was heard.<br/><br/>More than ten figures flew over immediately.<br/><br/>The leader was a Level 1 universe knight.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked over and waved his arm. Other than that universe knight, everyone else was killed.<br/><br/>“Soul Catcher!”<br/><br/>He stared at the Universe Knight of the Heavenly Dragon Clan who had his eyes wide open. He waved his arm and performed soul catcher.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>A stream of information was transmitted into Wang Xian’s mind. After seeing this information, a smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>He flew straight ahead.<br/><br/>The layout of the entire dragon palace was almost identical to that of the Heavenly Sea Dragon Palace. However, compared to the Heavenly Sea Dragon Palace, it was much weaker.<br/><br/>After flying all the way to the Dragon King Palace, he arrived at the back of the Dragon Throne.<br/><br/>Over there was the treasure vault of the Heavenly Dragon Clan.<br/><br/>“As expected of the treasure vault of the Heavenly Dragon Clan!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian entered and immediately felt a majestic energy impact. This caused his eyes to light up and he revealed a fiery expression.<br/><br/>Although the Heavenly Dragon Clan did not have a very deep foundation, there were several primary races in the universe that they had destroyed during the billions of years of their rise.<br/><br/>In addition, the Heavenly Dragon Clan was fond of collecting treasures.<br/><br/>The treasures in the Heavenly Dragon Clan were huge.<br/><br/>There were all kinds of pills, weapons, and treasures.<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and kept them all in his bag.<br/><br/>After emptying the entire treasury, he went to the back.<br/><br/>It was located at the back and was also a dragon tomb. However, there were not many dragon tombs, only seven or eight of them.<br/><br/>However, those who could be buried here were all universe knights.<br/><br/>“Other than some pills and weapons, the entire Dragon Palace is also a huge resource.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian kept the dragon bones of the Heavenly Dragons in the Dragon Tomb and muttered.<br/><br/>“Eh? This Is?”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian looked at the mountain peak in the deepest part of the mountain.<br/><br/>There was an entrance there. There was a huge forbidden word written on the top of the entrance.<br/><br/>“Forbidden?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. After hesitating for a moment, he came to the front of the entrance.<br/><br/>The entrance was not big. It was only about four meters. There was a stone door. It was obvious that he did not want anyone to enter.<br/><br/>He looked inside and revealed a hesitant expression.<br/><br/>He walked to the front of the stone door and pushed it forcefully.<br/><br/>The strong resistance caused a look of surprise to appear in his eyes.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s arm turned into a dragon claw and forcefully opened a huge hole.<br/><br/>Just as he opened the hole, a terrifying and strange force came from inside.<br/><br/>One of the forces was familiar to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Heaven Pilfering Meridian Exchange? A forbidden technique? An ancient technique?”<br/><br/>He mumbled as he looked inside.<br/><br/>The hole was not very big. There were two stone tables inside.<br/><br/>One of the tables was empty while the other table had a box on it. The box was about one meter long.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the box and hesitated for a moment before opening it.<br/><br/>Crack! Crack<br/><br/>When the box was opened, there was a sculpture inside.<br/><br/>When he saw the sculpture inside, he was slightly stunned.<br/><br/>The upper body of the sculpture was that of a woman while the lower body was that of a divine dragon.<br/><br/>The hair on her head was not hair, but venomous snakes that looked extremely cold.<br/><br/>The eyes of the sculpture were blood-red, as though they possessed a mysterious energy.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Just as Wang Xian was staring at the sculpture, a strange energy suddenly surged into his mind.<br/><br/>He felt that he was surrounded by a large number of beautiful women with human bodies and dragon bodies and venomous snakes on their heads.<br/><br/>They stuck out their tongues and revealed their ghastly mouths. Then, they started to devour him.<br/><br/>Wang Xian could feel that his body was being devoured bit by bit.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>At this moment, a ray of clarity came from his chest, causing him to cleanse himself.<br/><br/>He hurriedly opened his eyes to get rid of this strange illusion.<br/><br/>“What’s going on?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at the statue in shock. His eyes widened slightly.<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>At this moment, he suddenly let out a cry of surprise and stared at his body in disbelief.<br/><br/>Feeling the intense pain from his body, his expression changed slightly.<br/><br/>At this moment, one-third of his body was actually missing.<br/><br/>The flesh and blood inside was exposed.<br/><br/>“Could it be this strange statue? When I was sizing her up, it attacked me? Was My hallucination not an illusion?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s face was filled with astonishment.<br/><br/>Snap<br/><br/>He immediately closed the box with a grave expression on his face.<br/><br/>“No wonder the Heaven Dragon King placed this thing here so solemnly. It’s really strange.”<br/><br/>He mumbled as his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>He kept it in his interspatial ring and prepared to return to the Dragon Palace to study it in front of the ancestral tree.<br/><br/>Otherwise, if not for the power of the ancestral tree, he would have been devoured unknowingly.<br/><br/>After leaving the stone room, he flew out of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Dragon King!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace flew over.<br/><br/>“How is it?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them and asked.<br/><br/>“The Heaven Array is still searching for the Divine Kingdoms of the Universe Knights. Some of the other powerhouses of the Heaven Dragon Clan have been killed by us.”<br/><br/>“The Sky Dragon Clan has been completely exterminated.”<br/><br/>Lei Ming and the rest said.<br/><br/>“The Sky Dragon King is not dead yet. We don’t know where he is now.”<br/><br/>“Let the sky array search here first. We will head to the ancient painting sect.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian pondered for a moment and said.<br/><br/>In order to prevent the treasures of the ancient painting sect from being taken away by the surviving disciples, they had to rush over in advance.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Everyone nodded.<br/><br/>They moved and immediately rushed towards the headquarters of the ancient painting sect.<br/><br/>The ancient painting sect had tens of thousands of huge planets and countless disciples.<br/><br/>The number of their sects was very terrifying.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
