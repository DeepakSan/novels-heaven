This was the most difficult battle since the beginning of the Dragon Palace’s battle.<br/><br/>If not for the appearance of Lei Ming, the Dragon Palace would have been defeated.<br/><br/>Even so, it was still very difficult to face the combined attacks of the three major races.<br/><br/>They could only be evenly matched.<br/><br/>The foundation of the skeleton clan and the bloodthirsty clan was too terrifying.<br/><br/>“The experts of our sect will only arrive in half a month.”<br/><br/>The two venerables of the ancient painting sect, who were located near the battlefield, looked at the information on the AI and said with a gloomy face.<br/><br/>They didn’t expect the strength of the Dragon Palace to be so strong that the combined attacks of the three great races couldn’t destroy it.<br/><br/>They were especially shocked by the Dragon Palace’s strength and the number of venerables.<br/><br/>Their strength and the number of venerables weren’t much weaker than their ancient art sect.<br/><br/>Even the ancient art sect couldn’t completely destroy the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“The sect master said that we can help the skeleton clan and see if we can destroy the Dragon Palace this time.”<br/><br/>“If we can destroy it, that’s great. If we can’t, then our ancient art sect can join forces with them.”<br/><br/>An old man from the ancient art sect said lightly.<br/><br/>“Let’s do it. Hehe, right now, the Dragon Palace and the skeleton race are maintaining a balance. Once we do it, the balance will be broken, and then the Dragon Palace will definitely not be their match.”<br/><br/>The eyes of the universe knights from the ancient art sect flashed. They looked at each other and moved their palms.<br/><br/>A pagoda appeared above the head of the old man on the left. A spiritual treasure that looked like a mace appeared in the hands of the other old man.<br/><br/>The two of them stared ahead with killing intent in their eyes.<br/><br/>“Skeleton race, bloodthirsty race, nine swords race, our ancient art sect is here to help you destroy the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>The two universe knights from the ancient art sect moved and attacked Wang Xian and the rest.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>“What? Why are the two universe knights from the ancient art sect suddenly helping the skeleton race?”<br/><br/>“What’s going on? The ancient art sect wants to destroy the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>“Hiss…”<br/><br/>The sudden attack of the two from the ancient art sect shocked many people.<br/><br/>“Did the knights from the ancient painting sect make a move? They are both Level 2 universe knights, the Dragon Palace will be in trouble.”<br/><br/>Some universe knights looked over and muttered.<br/><br/>They came earlier and understood the grudge between the ancient painting sect and the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>However, those who didn’t understand were shocked.<br/><br/>They didn’t understand why the two knights from the ancient painting sect would help the skeleton clan.<br/><br/>“The ancient painting sect’s Lou Shan venerate was killed by the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>At this time, a universe Knight said indifferently.<br/><br/>“What? Lou Shan venerate was killed by the Dragon Palace? This…”<br/><br/>“No Wonder, no wonder the two venerables of the ancient painting sect wanted to make a move.”<br/><br/>“The two venerables of the ancient painting sect are level 2. Once they make a move, the balance will definitely be broken. This time, the Dragon Palace will be in trouble.”<br/><br/>Everyone was discussing among themselves as they watched in shock.<br/><br/>No one expected that the Dragon Palace would actually kill Venerable Lou Shan and the others of the ancient painting sect, as well as the Vice Sect Master of the ancient painting sect.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace would probably be destroyed.<br/><br/>Some people thought to themselves.<br/><br/>Even if the Dragon Palace was not destroyed this time, they would probably have to face the alliance of the four major forces.<br/><br/>There were also powerful existences like the ancient painting sect among them.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>“Not good!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly when he saw the two universe knights from the ancient art sect who suddenly attacked.<br/><br/>The sudden addition of two universe knights at level two would increase the pressure on the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>It would even cause a large number of members of the Dragon Palace to be injured.<br/><br/>His expression changed as he waved his arm.<br/><br/>“Ancient art sect, sooner or later, my Dragon Palace will destroy you.”<br/><br/>The Five Elements Millstone attacked the two of them and shouted coldly.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, destroy our ancient painting sect? Our Ancient Painting Sect Will Destroy Your Dragon Palace first.”<br/><br/>A Universe Knight from the Ancient Painting sect roared with killing intent.<br/><br/>“Hong Hong Hong!”<br/><br/>As he spoke, the pagoda in his hand rose, and a hurricane blew out from within, attacking the five elements millstone.<br/><br/>“Humph!”<br/><br/>Another expert from the ancient art sect waved his arm, and the mace in his hand smashed toward the five elements millstone.<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>The enormous force caused the five elements millstone to fly backward.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>The Five Divine Dragons raised their heads and roared furiously on the five elements millstone.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, Kill, kill all the people from the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>“Thank you to the ancient painting sect. Let’s join hands and destroy the Dragon Palace. Leave No one alive. Leave No one alive!”<br/><br/>The Golden Skeleton Patriarch and the nine sword clan patriarch roared ferociously.<br/><br/>“Good, good, leave no one alive in the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>The Universe Knights from the ancient painting sect replied with a grim expression.<br/><br/>They would definitely destroy the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Oh no, the Dragon Palace is going to be in trouble.”<br/><br/>The surrounding disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect had a slight change in expression when they saw this situation.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was once a disciple of the willow deity Daoist sect. Furthermore, he had given them many treasures. Naturally, they hoped that the Dragon Palace could win.<br/><br/>However, the current situation was disadvantageous to the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Should we make a move?”<br/><br/>Not far away from the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect, the woman who was leaning on the willow tree had a hesitant look on her face.<br/><br/>She looked at the passive Earth Dragon Palace and slowly clenched her fist.<br/><br/>“Ha ha, it’s already very difficult for me to continue my cultivation. If it weren’t for the treasures given by the Dragon King, I wouldn’t have been able to break through.”<br/><br/>As the woman spoke, she slightly narrowed her eyes.<br/><br/>Her figure moved and instantly disappeared.<br/><br/>“Kill!”<br/><br/>“Kill!”<br/><br/>In front of them, the dragon skeleton and the Patriarch of the blood violence clan saw the two venerables at the second level of the ancient painting sect attack. When they saw that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had no choice but to deal with the experts of the ancient painting sect, bloodthirsty and excited expressions blossomed in their eyes.<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>A powerful energy swept over, forcing the members of the Dragon Palace to retreat and Dodge. Their faces were filled with a solemn expression.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, die!”<br/><br/>The clan leader of the Blood Evil clan roared. The blood column in the sky condensed into the shape of a blood dragon and charged toward Lei Ming.<br/><br/>“Weeping willows in the Milky Way reflect the mountains and rivers!”<br/><br/>Suddenly, a voice resounded through the entire void. The voice was filled with indifference.<br/><br/>In the sky above the Milky Way, willow branches slowly drooped down.<br/><br/>The willow branches were incomparably lush and swaying.<br/><br/>Under the rain, the willow branches looked somewhat beautiful.<br/><br/>However, within this beauty, there was a great terror.<br/><br/>The countless willow branches directly swept towards the blood dragon formed from the blood pillar.<br/><br/>“PA, PA, PA!”<br/><br/>Like the sound of countless raindrops falling on the Milky Way, the willow branches struck the blood dragon, instantly crushing it.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I’ll help you.”<br/><br/>A voice sounded, and a woman holding willow trees appeared below the countless willow branches.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
