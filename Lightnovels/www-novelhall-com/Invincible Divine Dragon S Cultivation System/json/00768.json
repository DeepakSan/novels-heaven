Lin Wenluo stood beside his simulated space beast and greeted him respectfully.<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and glanced at Wu Sha. He looked surprised. “You’ve made a breakthrough?”<br/><br/>“Yes, Dragon King. My strength has already reached the peak of the first stage of the Dominator realm. I just made a breakthrough not too long ago.”<br/><br/>Wu Sha said with a smile.<br/><br/>“Not bad, not bad!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian revealed a look of satisfaction. “How many metallic meteorites have you obtained over a hundred thousand years ago?”<br/><br/>“Dragon King, all of them are here!”<br/><br/>Wu Sha waved her arm and an interspatial ring flew towards him.<br/><br/>Wang Xian took it and sensed it for a moment. His eyes shone brightly.<br/><br/>Over a hundred thousand years, Wu Sha and the rest had obtained a large number of metal meteorites.<br/><br/>“TSK TSK, these meteorites from the starry sky can elevate the five elements millstone to the sixth level of the Universe Dominator. However, I’m afraid it will be difficult to elevate the Taiji Dragon Plate!”<br/><br/>He mumbled.<br/><br/>The five elements Millstone had already swallowed the piece of frost metal. Now that he was close to a breakthrough, he only needed a little of the five elements metal.<br/><br/>As for the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, he needed a lot more!<br/><br/>At most, he could advance to the level five of the Dominator!<br/><br/>“Next, I’ll upgrade the Tai Chi Dragon Disc and the five elements millstone here. With my help, the speed of absorbing the metal can be reduced by a hundred times!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled.<br/><br/>His current strength had reached the level of a dominator at level six. He could help the five elements millstone absorb metal energy quickly.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian still had one more thing to do.<br/><br/>He entered the interior of a space beast simulated by Lin Wenluo. With a wave of his arm, he laid down another energy.<br/><br/>From the mother nest, he sensed the corpses of the fire phoenixes and took out their spatial treasures.<br/><br/>There were 201 ruler-level corpses of the fire phoenixes. One of them was at the sixth level, three were at the fifth level, and the rest were all at the first level to the fourth level!<br/><br/>In addition, there was the corpse of sky fire ancestor!<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>When he saw the large number of sky fire ancestor’s corpses, he was slightly stunned. There was no space treasure on the corpse of Sky Fire ancestor.<br/><br/>There was also no fortuitous treasure.<br/><br/>“This is a little strange. Could it be that the Skyfire Patriarch is still alive and survived through the life-saving treasure? This is very possible. After all, he is known as the first person to obtain a great opportunity in the starry universe.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian guessed in his heart.<br/><br/>However, the corpse of the Skyfire Patriarch could bring 100 disciples at the peak of the supremacy realm to the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>He continued to search for the other fire phoenixes’spatial treasures.<br/><br/>As they couldn’t sense their divine kingdoms in the starry universe, their treasures had to be placed in the spatial treasures.<br/><br/>Soon, a large amount of resources and treasures appeared in his sight.<br/><br/>“The Phoenix race is similar to the Divine Dragon Race. They don’t use weapons much and they are the strongest items. That’s why they only have five innate supreme treasures.”<br/><br/>“This is the divine parasol tree. It has such powerful fire energy. This divine parasol tree can absorb it, but the dragon palace has its branches.”<br/><br/>“This is a very dense fire stone. It seems to be condensed from the energy in the center of the heart of the fire treasure ground. Are they condensing the fire energy into something tangible in one way?”? “Absorbing this fire stone should be equivalent to a hundred years of cultivation in the heart of the fire treasure ground.”<br/><br/>“This is the feather of a Phoenix. It is the feather of a phoenix that is in the fifth stage and can be forged into a powerful treasure.”<br/><br/>“What kind of divine stone is this? It actually contains a terrifying life force. A treasure that can increase life force after absorption? This should be a powerful treasure!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sized up the 201 treasures of the Fire Phoenix. His eyes were glowing.<br/><br/>The powerful Phoenix Feathers and 20 fire energy stones were already a divine stone that could increase one’s lifespan.<br/><br/>Even if this divine stone was placed on one’s body, it could greatly increase one’s self-recovery ability.<br/><br/>If it was absorbed, it could also increase one’s lifespan.<br/><br/>If it was absorbed when one was severely injured, it could also heal one’s injuries.<br/><br/>In short, it was a very powerful treasure. To the Phoenix clan, it was an even rarer item.<br/><br/>Other than these special treasures, the rest were resources.<br/><br/>The resources that the fire phoenixes obtained from the various life planets.<br/><br/>If it was more than a hundred thousand years ago, these resources would have allowed Wang Xian to break through easily.<br/><br/>However, it was insufficient now!<br/><br/>However, it could also increase his dragon energy by quite a bit.<br/><br/>After tidying up all the treasures, Wang Xian revealed a smile.<br/><br/>Many of the treasures could give the fire element disciples of the Dragon Palace a huge boost.<br/><br/>In addition, other than these treasures, the biggest reward was naturally the 201 corpses.<br/><br/>A corpse of a ruler in the first stage could increase the number of supremacies in the Dragon Palace by 10.<br/><br/>An increase of 100 in the second stage.<br/><br/>An increase of 1,000 in the third stage.<br/><br/>An increase of 10,000 in the fourth stage.<br/><br/>An increase of 100,000 in the fifth stage.<br/><br/>1,000,000 for the sixth stage.<br/><br/>Yes, that was how terrifying it was!<br/><br/>A master of the sixth stage had absorbed so much energy and consumed so many resources.<br/><br/>To a Master of the sixth stage, a peak venerable was like an ant!<br/><br/>A million peak venerables were no match for a Master of the sixth stage.<br/><br/>A master at the level six realm could increase the number of peak of the venerable realm in the Dragon Palace by a million.<br/><br/>That was how terrifying it was.<br/><br/>There were many disciples at the peak of the venerable realm in the peak races. However, the peak races did not care much about disciples at this level.<br/><br/>Take the disciples of the peak races in the invincible zone as an example. Even if they died, the peak races would not care at all.<br/><br/>Just like the last time when Wang Xian killed hundreds of phoenixes, the Phoenixes acted as if nothing had happened.<br/><br/>They didn’t care.<br/><br/>This was because as long as they took out the resources, they would be able to produce a large number of disciples at the peak of the supremacy realm.<br/><br/>However, they didn’t do so because the resources were limited.<br/><br/>The resources were limited. It was better to give them to the disciples at the supremacy realm than to give them to the experts at the Dominator realm.<br/><br/>If one did not reach the supremacy level, they would still be in the calamity. They would only be cannon fodder.<br/><br/>Although the masters of the peak races did not care, Wang Xian cared very much.<br/><br/>Compared to the foundation of the peak races, the current Dragon Palace could not be compared.<br/><br/>Without him, any peak race would be able to destroy the Dragon Palace if they sent out a master at level four or five.<br/><br/>Just like the sky fire sect, the sky fire patriarch wasn’t bad. He had reached the level two sovereign realm and made the entire sect reach the level of a peak race. However, after he was killed, the entire sky fire sect became a high-level race again.<br/><br/>This was the problem of the foundation.<br/><br/>The foundation of the Dragon Palace was still very, very poor!<br/><br/>Now, with these resources, the foundation of the Dragon Palace would increase by a large margin!<br/><br/>Of course, it would only be a huge improvement. It would not be able to catch up to the peak races.<br/><br/>There was still a huge gap between them.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian believed that the Dragon Palace could rise up against the trend!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
