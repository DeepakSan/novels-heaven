Is this a mutated divine dragon?”<br/><br/>“Hahaha, I didn’t expect that after billions of years, this day would finally come! Finally!”<br/><br/>In the Dragon King Palace of the Sky Sea Dragon Palace, an illusory shadow stood in front of the dragon throne. He looked at the scene in front of him with excitement in his eyes.<br/><br/>At this moment, his awe-inspiring face showed how terrifying he was.<br/><br/>“Well done, well done. I was planning to host your body, but I didn’t expect you to give me such a big surprise. hahaha!”<br/><br/>He looked at the figure in front of him, which made his illusory figure tremble with excitement.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“I must succeed, I must succeed. As long as I succeed in the heaven pilfered bloodline changing, I will have a powerful divine dragon bloodline, and I will no longer be an ordinary dragon bloodline<br/><br/>“As long as I succeed in the heaven pilfering change, I will be able to inherit the Sky Sea Dragon Palace and lead the Sky Dragon clan to the peak.”<br/><br/>At the same time, at the Herb Garden of the Sky Sea Dragon Palace, he came to a herb garden through powerful nomological restrictions.<br/><br/>In this herb garden, there were many divine herbs growing.<br/><br/>Every divine herb had the image of a divine dragon flashing around it from time to time, and it looked abnormally mystical.<br/><br/>This was dragon blood grass, a very precious dragon blood grass to the Asian dragons.<br/><br/>The reason why their Heavenly Dragon Clan was able to rise so quickly was largely due to this dragon blood grass.<br/><br/>Not everyone was able to enter the medicinal garden of the Tianhai Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Up until now, only he had been able to enter that powerful forbidden area.<br/><br/>The Heavenly Dragon King stared at the ancient black box in his hand with a burning face as he slowly opened it.<br/><br/>“Buzz!”<br/><br/>A terrifying energy came from inside.<br/><br/>There was a black liquid inside. The liquid was squirming and giving off a strong smell of blood.<br/><br/>It seemed to be the blood of a creature.<br/><br/>The Heavenly Dragon King slowly walked to the center and buried the black liquid in the soil according to certain rules.<br/><br/>He carefully dealt with it. He walked to the place where the liquid was buried and lay in the soil as well.<br/><br/>His palm moved slightly, and blood flowed out of his wrist, completely merging with the black liquid.<br/><br/>The life force of the Heaven Dragon King slowly disappeared until all of his life force disappeared.<br/><br/>However, his eyes were fixed on the entrance of the herbal garden.<br/><br/>He waited quietly, waiting for his powerful opportunity.<br/><br/>He was waiting for the transformation this time.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, this Dragon Palace is a little strange.”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian and the willow deity, who were in the Tianhai Dragon Palace, were observing their surroundings.<br/><br/>The willow deity frowned slightly and couldn’t help but speak.<br/><br/>“Yes, it’s a little strange. This place is filled with vitality. It doesn’t look like the Dragon Palace of a fallen Dragon King.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded. His face was also filled with doubt.<br/><br/>The Dragon Field and dragon lair seemed to be functioning normally.<br/><br/>It didn’t look like the Dragon Palace of a fallen Dragon King.<br/><br/>“It’s a little strange.”<br/><br/>This time, Wang Xian didn’t speak directly. Instead, he transmitted his voice, “Be careful. Let’s go and take a look at the front.”<br/><br/>As he spoke, he continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>After flying for a few minutes, they could see waves of powerful nomological powers at the front.<br/><br/>Through these powers of laws, they could vaguely see a medicinal garden in front of them.<br/><br/>There were quite a number of demonic beasts searching carefully in front of them, wanting to enter.<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze across them. There were more than ten great demons in this group of people.<br/><br/>He narrowed his eyes slightly and swept his dragon eyes forward.<br/><br/>“If it were the Dragon Palace, it would be difficult for the entire Dragon Palace to continue operating after my death, not to mention these powers of laws.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian muttered to himself and transmitted his voice to the willow deity.<br/><br/>He had obtained the complete inheritance of the Divine Dragon Clan, so he was very clear about the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace was equivalent to the Divine Kingdom of the Divine Dragon. Once this divine dragon died, the Dragon Palace would gradually decline.<br/><br/>As for the Tianhai Dragon Palace, it actually had rules and the power of laws.<br/><br/>There was only one possibility, and that was that the Tianhai Dragon King did not die.<br/><br/>“There are two possibilities. He was severely injured and fell into a deep sleep. The second possibility is that he was trapped somewhere.”<br/><br/>The willow deity muttered.<br/><br/>“That’s not right. If he was in a deep sleep or trapped, the Dragon Palace shouldn’t have opened itself. The skysea Dragon King is inside.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head. His eyes were filled with vigilance.<br/><br/>A Dragon King who hadn’t died yet opened his own dragon palace every ten thousand years. What was he scheming?<br/><br/>What was the reason?<br/><br/>He pondered in his heart and was filled with wariness towards the Tianhai Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Although they were both divine dragons, there were conflicts between divine dragons.<br/><br/>Just like humans, there were no 100% harmonious races.<br/><br/>In the universe, there was competition everywhere.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. I have a feeling that the laws in front of us don’t have much effect on the dragons with higher purity bloodlines.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian scanned the powers of the laws in front of the herb garden and said.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The willow deity nodded and a hint of wariness appeared in her eyes.<br/><br/>However, since they were already here, it was impossible for them to go back directly.<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew to the front and extended his arm into the laws in front of him.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>As expected, he didn’t encounter much resistance and was able to enter directly.<br/><br/>He took a glance at the willow deity and the two of them walked straight in.<br/><br/>“Eh? They actually entered the herb garden!”<br/><br/>“What? They found a way to enter the herb garden!”<br/><br/>“Hiss, they seem to be the second to enter the herb garden apart from the Heaven Dragon King.”<br/><br/>At this moment, the surrounding great demons were shocked when they saw Wang Xian and the rest entering the herb garden easily.<br/><br/>They flew over in a hurry with envious looks on their faces.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest ignored them and walked straight ahead.<br/><br/>When they entered the herb garden, they immediately felt waves of majestic spiritual energy.<br/><br/>However, there wasn’t any godly herb in this herb garden. It must have been taken away by someone.<br/><br/>“What a powerful divine dragon bloodline. Hahaha, it seems like I need to guide him. The probability of success is too low with just that fellow.”<br/><br/>“Also, the bloodline of that lady is not low either. I can sense that she is very strong. It seems like I need to lure her to a side. I Can’t let her ruin the ceremony.”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian and the rest entered the herb garden, the illusory figure in the Dragon King Hall of the skysea Dragon Palace was murmuring. He was filled with excitement and excitement.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>At the same time, Wang Xian and the rest entered the herb garden. They immediately discovered that there were many divine herbs in another herb garden in front of them.<br/><br/>They were stunned for a moment before rushing over immediately.<br/><br/>Similarly, they needed to pass through another law energy. Their eyes lit up when they entered the herb garden.<br/><br/>All of them were godly herbs at the level of universe knights. There were more than 100 of them.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
