The horrifying tentacle made the light giant, who was a level three universe master, look terrified!<br/><br/>Frost Dragon Northfrost’s attack and the water-tentacle King’s attack. Faced with their attacks, the moment the light giant was bound by the frost, he was completely entangled by the water-tentacle King’s tentacles!<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>A miserable scream came out from his mouth. He roared furiously with a face full of shock and anger!<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the light giant who was supported by him and attacked by Wang Xian also let out a miserable scream and a voice full of despair!<br/><br/>“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, all of you deserve to die!”<br/><br/>At the side, the chief of the giant of light saw this scene and his heart pounded violently. He roared in a stern voice!<br/><br/>However, he was also resisting the attacks of the other experts of the dragon palace at this moment. There was no chance for him to rescue them at all!<br/><br/>“Bang Bang!”<br/><br/>The two giant of light let out miserable screams one after another. Under the attacks of Wang Xian and the king of water touch, their life force vanished!<br/><br/>Their huge corpses slowly fell to the ground!<br/><br/>“Spread out and run. Immediately contact the god Herder tribe and the others. Contact the Angel Tribe!”<br/><br/>When the clan leader of the light sound bug tribe saw this scene, his expression changed drastically as he shouted in shock!<br/><br/>The strength of the Dragon Palace was too terrifying!<br/><br/>They believed that they were the strongest among the level three masters of the universe. They believed that they had a powerful trump card and a powerful innate supreme treasure!<br/><br/>However, facing Dragon Palace Dragon King and the others, they felt that they were very weak!<br/><br/>Whether it was Dragon Palace Dragon King, the red-clothed woman, or the war pet, they all posed a threat to their lives!<br/><br/>As a subsidiary race of the Angel Race, as a top-tier high-level race, weren’t they strong?<br/><br/>They were also very strong!<br/><br/>But why were there so many freaks in Dragon Palace?<br/><br/>“Peng Peng!”<br/><br/>Below, two huge giants fell to the ground, making heavy sounds!<br/><br/>“Hiss, this… The Holy Dragon Bloodline, the light giant race, and the light sound bug race are not their match at all, the Dragon Palace is so strong!”<br/><br/>“This godly dragon giant fell, and those who were killed were all universe ruler level 3 warriors. My God, the power of the Dragon Palace is too terrifying, the number of warriors in the Dragon Palace is not much more than the three races!”<br/><br/>“It’s because the Dragon King and that red-clothed figure are too strong. Those of the same level are easily killed!”<br/><br/>“My God, is this the strength of the Dragon Palace? How can the six races of the sacred dragon lineage destroy the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>In Sky City, all the disciples of the experts were stunned as they watched the battle. Their faces were filled with shock.<br/><br/>The three races of the sacred dragon lineage were actually chased by the Dragon Palace. Moreover, since the beginning of the war, several Dragon Gods and Giants had fallen!<br/><br/>In their eyes, these experts were already at the peak of their abilities!<br/><br/>However, they had fallen right before their eyes!<br/><br/>The strength of the Dragon Palace had shocked them!<br/><br/>“Continue, kill!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian killed the second giant of light. His gaze was locked onto a third-level universe dominator of the light sound bug race. He flapped his incipient sacred wings and chased after them!<br/><br/>With Wang Xian’s speed, there was no room for him to escape!<br/><br/>He was already being attacked by the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace. Now that he saw Wang Xian charging at him, his heart tightened and he revealed a panicked expression!<br/><br/>“Insect God, support me!”<br/><br/>He quickly called for help!<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>At the next moment, at the center of the Lightsong Zerg, the gigantic Zerg that was more than 10,000 kilometers in size suddenly opened its eyes!<br/><br/>The number of eyes was countless!<br/><br/>All eyes were fixed on Wang Xian as they released a dazzling laser beam!<br/><br/>The light beam covered a large area behind them. More than a dozen experts from the Dragon Palace were also completely covered!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>A Ray of Aurora charged directly at Wang Xian!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s body trembled. The tai chi dragon coiled around his body and charged directly at the Aurora!<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>Crack! Crack<br/><br/>The Aurora struck the Taiji dragon coiled around his body. Cracks slowly appeared on the Taiji dragon coiled around his body!<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw this. The attack of this gigantic bug was rather powerful!<br/><br/>In a one-on-one battle, this bug should be able to kill a level three master of the universe!<br/><br/>CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP<br/><br/>However, when the Bug’s attack collided with the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, a terrifying backlash surged toward them!<br/><br/>The Tai Chi Dragon Disc was made from Wang Xian’s light and dark clones, as well as a huge amount of energy and treasures!<br/><br/>It also absorbed the energy of the curse.<br/><br/>Any attack that landed on the Tai Chi Dragon Disc would suffer a backlash!<br/><br/>Other than the fact that the opponent was very strong and could easily defeat the Tai Chi Dragon Disc!<br/><br/>Otherwise, the power of the backlash was even stronger than his attack!<br/><br/>In the middle of the glowing insects in front of him, there were countless bugs gathered together on the gigantic bugs. Their pupils were covered in blood and screams came from their mouths. Under the backlash, a large number of bugs.., died immediately!<br/><br/>“Giant of Light, suppress it for me!”<br/><br/>A roar came from the side!<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked over. The eight giants of light, together with the leader of the Giants of light, were holding up the giant of light. The terrifying power of light was injected into it, causing the sky above the giant of light to condense into the image of a desolate beast!<br/><br/>They smashed the giant of light towards Ling Honggu!<br/><br/>When Ling Honggu saw this attack, she revealed a serious expression!<br/><br/>“Crimson, illusion!”<br/><br/>Her red dress trembled slightly, and thousands of identical figures appeared around her instantly!<br/><br/>Each figure extended their palms, and blood-red energy was condensed on them!<br/><br/>“Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang!”<br/><br/>Each figure charged towards the light mountain, and their palms landed heavily on it!<br/><br/>Following the collision, the figures collapsed and dissipated!<br/><br/>As for the desolate beast figures condensed on the Light Mountain, they began to dim bit by bit!<br/><br/>Over a thousand figures came one after another. The light mountain slowly stopped in the void and was completely blocked!<br/><br/>And out of over a thousand figures, there were only a few left!<br/><br/>“How is this possible!”<br/><br/>The light giant patriarch roared in disbelief.<br/><br/>How… How was this possible?<br/><br/>This was an attack by him leading eight universe masters with level-three Combat Power!<br/><br/>This was an attack by the enormous and terrifying light giant mountain!<br/><br/>And it was actually blocked?<br/><br/>A true universe master level great being was only so-so, right?<br/><br/>“We can’t fight, run with all our might!”<br/><br/>The light giant leader roared loudly!<br/><br/>This wasn’t a battle of the same level!<br/><br/>This opponent seemed to have a true universe master, too strong!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
