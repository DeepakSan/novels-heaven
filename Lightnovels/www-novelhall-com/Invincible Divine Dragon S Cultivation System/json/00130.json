The weakest was also a god Emperor Level 6, and the strongest was a peak God Emperor.<br/><br/>These were the items that the immortal palace’s Battle Pets were auctioning off.<br/><br/>Once these battle angels were announced, the nine swords race would definitely know that he had obtained the treasure of the Crescent Mystic Realm.<br/><br/>They would also target him.<br/><br/>If he auctioned it with his identity or the identity of the Dragon Palace, he would definitely be besieged by the nine swords race and the Dragon Race.<br/><br/>That was why he went through so much trouble to build a powerful and mysterious immortal palace battle pet.<br/><br/>At least, before everyone knew the details of the immortal palace battle pet, they would not dare to cause trouble or even snatch it.<br/><br/>As long as this auction was successfully completed, then the Immortal Palace’s War Pet would disappear without a trace.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace would walk to the front.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Mi Xin Lu nodded and immediately hung the information of the battle angel and more than a thousand divine artifacts on the cosmic AI.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, we have classified all the books in the Crescent God Country. This is the information you wanted about the primary races in the Milky Way.”<br/><br/>At this moment, a civil official walked over and brought the books over respectfully.<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and placed the books aside, he looked at the civil official and said, “Tell Prime Minister Gui to make an announcement in the name of the Dragon Palace after the information from the Divine Palace’s War Pets is announced. He knows the content clearly.”<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The civil official of the Dragon Palace nodded respectfully.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and picked up the books at the side. Through these books, he could gain a detailed understanding of the various races in the Milky Way.<br/><br/>Just as Wang Xian was reading the books of the various races, a storm swept across the entire Milky Way.<br/><br/>“There are more than 10,000 Battle Angels, Universe knight-level battle angels, at least level six divine emperors, and nine peak divine emperors. Is… is this divine palace’s battle pets going to Heaven?”<br/><br/>“Is this F * cking real or fake? How can this auction be so terrifying? Universe Knight Level Battle Angels? This…”<br/><br/>“F * CK, F * CK, F * ck, I can’t fucking believe this. Is this an auction for a universe primary race?”<br/><br/>“Hiss… am I seeing things? What the Hell Is Going On? Where did the immortal palace battle pet get so many Battle Angels?”<br/><br/>The first time the Immortal Palace Battle Pet announced an auction, it directly dropped a universe knight level battle pet. Everyone felt that it was awesome.<br/><br/>Ten days ago, it announced the addition of seven peak God Emperor level battle pets. Everyone cried out in unison, “Awesome!”!<br/><br/>Today, looking at the additional auction items, everyone swallowed a mouthful of saliva.<br/><br/>Was this an auction for a low-level universe race?<br/><br/>Everyone was in disbelief and felt that it was unbelievable.<br/><br/>A universe primary race could have over a million divine emperor level disciples. How many divine emperor level and above could there be?<br/><br/>20,000 or 30,000?<br/><br/>However, this time, the Immortal Palace Battle Pets sold more than 14,000 divine emperor level and above combat strength.<br/><br/>This… was too terrifying.<br/><br/>Soon after, another piece of news spread out.<br/><br/>The news came from the Dragon Palace. Everyone was filled with curiosity towards the word ‘Dragon Palace’.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace had released a piece of news.<br/><br/>The primary race of the Dragon Palace universe would officially enter the Milky Way. This time, they would cooperate with the divine palace battle pets and obtain some treasures from the auction.<br/><br/>Upon seeing this information, everyone’s faces were filled with shock.<br/><br/>Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>Those battle angels were actually obtained by the Dragon Palace?<br/><br/>Where did the Dragon Palace come from?<br/><br/>How could they produce so many treasures?<br/><br/>For a moment, the entire Milky Way was in turmoil.<br/><br/>The sudden appearance of a primary race in the universe would have a huge impact on the entire Milky Way.<br/><br/>Especially since the Dragon Palace didn’t seem to be weak.<br/><br/>After all, the treasures they were selling were too powerful.<br/><br/>“Dragon Palace, Wang Xian, Willow deity Daoist sect!”<br/><br/>At this moment, in the nine swords race, more than ten elders were sitting in a large hall. They looked at the information on the AI and let out a cold voice.<br/><br/>When they saw the more than ten thousand battle angels and even the battle angels at the supremacy level, their eyes revealed an extremely heated expression.<br/><br/>Back then, the eight elders of nine swords had also entered. If they had not been killed, all the treasures would have belonged to the nine swords race.<br/><br/>This treasure was too big, so big that even the universe knights were envious.<br/><br/>“That Wang Xian is definitely someone from the Dragon Palace. If not for this fellow, all the treasures would have been ours.”<br/><br/>An old man couldn’t help but growl in a low voice.<br/><br/>The treasures were too abundant.<br/><br/>“It’s too late to say anything now. Investigate all the information about the Dragon Palace immediately. If there’s a chance, destroy it.”<br/><br/>In the middle, an old man said with a grim expression.<br/><br/>“It’s the clan leader, the clan leader. That Wang Xian is currently wanted by the dragon-descendant race. Furthermore, we found out that the dragon-faced venerable of the dragon-descendant race seems to have perished.”<br/><br/>An elder holding a huge sword at the side said faintly.<br/><br/>“Oh? The dragon-faced venerable of the dragon-descendant race has fallen?”<br/><br/>Some of the elders around were slightly shocked. Their faces revealed a look of shock.<br/><br/>“There shouldn’t be a mistake. Furthermore, the dragon-descendant race has exhausted all their information departments and is currently searching for information on the Dragon Palace. I think we can communicate with the people of the dragon-descendant race.”<br/><br/>The elder of the nine swords race narrowed his eyes and said.<br/><br/>“Yes, the enemy of the enemy is a friend. You have to pay the price for taking away our nine swords’Opportunity.”<br/><br/>The clan leader of the nine swords race said coldly.<br/><br/>“I just don’t know the background of the Immortal Palace’s War Pet and what it has to do with the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>An elder frowned and said.<br/><br/>The venerable level war pet that the Celestial Palace’s War Pet sold was a real one. This required a powerful force to suppress it.<br/><br/>Mysterious and powerful!<br/><br/>Currently, the Dragon Palace had no relationship with it. However, the relationship between the ninth-grade parties was better.<br/><br/>In that case, they had no choice but to be cautious.<br/><br/>“If the Celestial Palace’s War Pet is a pure merchant, they will not participate in the fights between the various forces.”<br/><br/>The elder with the giant sword pondered for a moment and made a guess.<br/><br/>“I hope so. Wang Xian, Dragon Palace, HMPH!”<br/><br/>The experts of the nine-sword race snorted coldly. Their eyes were flashing with a sharp killing intent.<br/><br/>“Get Ready. There are so many treasures this time. We have to fight for them too. We have to get that battle angel or War Pet of the venerable level.”<br/><br/>The leader of the nine-sword race in the middle said faintly.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
