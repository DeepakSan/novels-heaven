A terrifying power covered the entire forbidden space’s domain!<br/><br/>That overwhelming aura and the terrifying aura of demonic beasts enveloped the entire lair of the forbidden space!<br/><br/>On their side, they could also hear his violent roar!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw it, he smiled faintly and used his energy to support the black hole passage. He watched on with an expressionless face!<br/><br/>“A powerful enemy has invaded! ”<br/><br/>“Oh no, what level of demonic beast is this? Prepare all the experts of the forbidden space!”<br/><br/>“Call the Master of the forbidden space to beat us up, call us the forefathers of the Forbidden Space!<br/><br/>The shocked and furious roars of the experts of the forbidden space rang out in the black hole!<br/><br/>“This? ? ?<br/><br/>At this moment, all the powerful disciples of the forbidden space and the Sacred Academy were dumbfounded!<br/><br/>Their faces were filled with shock and astonishment.<br/><br/>They were all filled with disbelief!<br/><br/>Especially when they looked at the black hole.<br/><br/>The bodies of all the powerful ones could not help but tremble!<br/><br/>This place was very, very far from the base of the forbidden space.<br/><br/>Then, that Sage Wang Xian!<br/><br/>No, that Wang Xian, who was known as the Dragon King, actually opened up a passageway!<br/><br/>What shocked them the most was that.<br/><br/>That magical beast that could speak human language.<br/><br/>It was impossible to tell how it attacked, but it killed all the experts in the forbidden space in an instant.<br/><br/>One had to know that among them, there was an expert who was at the level of a ruler at level nine!<br/><br/>This expert who was at the level of a ruler of the universe at level nine could be comparable to the first elder, second elder, and Granny Yuan in the Flowing Water Forbidden Space!<br/><br/>Such a terrifying master was instantly killed by that demonic beast!<br/><br/>What level was that demonic beast at?<br/><br/>Even if it wasn’t a Heavenly Yuan creation-level demonic beast, it was probably not something that a master at the peak of the universe could compare to!<br/><br/>In fact, it might even be able to destroy the forbidden space!<br/><br/>Then, such a terrifying existence was just the Dragon King, the Mount of that Sage Wang Xian?<br/><br/>Then, what level of existence was this one?<br/><br/>A terrifying thought suddenly appeared in their minds!<br/><br/>Could it be?<br/><br/>Could it be an existence above the ruler realm?<br/><br/>Could it be the Heavenly Yuan Destiny Realm?<br/><br/>At the Flowing Water Forbidden Ground!<br/><br/>Granny Yuan, the first elder of the flowing water forbidden ground, and the second elder!<br/><br/>As well as the other forbidden grounds and sacred academies, the peak-stage ruler realm experts who had rushed over also looked at this scene in shock!<br/><br/>The strength of the Linniu was so powerful that it caused them to feel fear and astonishment!<br/><br/>“Although the strength of that demonic beast has not reached the Tianyuan blessed realm, its combat strength is still able to kill any peak-stage ruler-level powerhouse in an instant!”<br/><br/>A peak-stage ruler-level powerhouse from the undeserved forbidden land muttered in astonishment!<br/><br/>He then looked at Wang Xian who was floating in the air.<br/><br/>He was stunned, completely stunned!<br/><br/>What kind of existence was this person?<br/><br/>When did such a terrifying expert appear in the sword and Magic Universe.<br/><br/>Such a terrifying expert!<br/><br/>Was He in the Heaven’s origin destiny realm?<br/><br/>He felt that there was at least a 50% chance!<br/><br/>That was because if he was not in the Heaven’s origin destiny realm, how could he make such a terrifying demonic beast as his mount?<br/><br/>Shocking!<br/><br/>Shocking!<br/><br/>At this moment, flowing Water Haolian, Flowing Water Qingming, and a few other powerful disciples of flowing water forbidden ground were all stunned.<br/><br/>As well as Xu fangxue, Qi Jiangping, Qi Xiaohe, and all the powerful disciples of the surrounding forbidden ground were all stunned! All of them had participated in killing long Yinhao.<br/><br/>At this moment, they were all stunned!<br/><br/>Especially the powerful disciples from the surrounding forbidden space!<br/><br/>There were thousands of powerful disciples from the forbidden space around them!<br/><br/>Just now, Lin Niu had only killed a few of them!<br/><br/>Many powerful disciples from the forbidden space were still gathered in the surroundings.<br/><br/>In the end, that terrifying demonic beast had already charged towards the nest of their forbidden space.<br/><br/>It was going to destroy their forbidden space!<br/><br/>The young man in front of them was even more unfathomable!<br/><br/>In fact, he seemed to be an existence at that realm!<br/><br/>This? ?<br/><br/>“Damn, brother-in-law, you… You? ? ?”<br/><br/>Long Yinhao stood there in a daze with his eyes wide open.<br/><br/>At this moment, he was in a daze and similarly, he couldn’t believe it!<br/><br/>This? ?<br/><br/>This brother-in-law of his?<br/><br/>What kind of existence was he?<br/><br/>“Brother Wang Xian, which one is you?”<br/><br/>Long yinyin couldn’t help but ask again. Her small face was filled with shock!<br/><br/>“Both of them are me. There’s no difference!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s real body looked at long yinyin and said with a smile.<br/><br/>The body of the Void Divine Dragon at the side slowly disappeared!<br/><br/>“Brother-in-law, brother Wang Xian, is that your clone? Is that your clone?” Long Yinhao asked in a daze!<br/><br/>“Yes, it can be considered as such. Due to an unexpected opportunity, I obtained a clone. Hence, it allowed me to cultivate the attributes of the controls. In essence, there is no difference! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and replied again!<br/><br/>“Then… then, brother… are you an existence from the Heaven’s origin?” Long Yinhao widened his eyes and continued to ask!<br/><br/>His question made the hearts of everyone in the surroundings tighten. Their eyes were fixed on him!<br/><br/>They looked at Wang Xian in fear and waited for his answer!<br/><br/>This was especially so for the great elder and the rest of the people in the flowing water forbidden ground. They clenched their fists tightly.<br/><br/>It was very important to them whether it was the heaven’s origin creation or not!<br/><br/>That was because the signal that Wang Xian had just expressed.<br/><br/>Was not friendly to them!<br/><br/>Furthermore, the actions that they had just displayed had also provoked this existence.<br/><br/>“He has not reached the realm yet! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not hide anything and answered directly!<br/><br/>His words made many people in the area heave a sigh of relief!<br/><br/>However, the next sentence made everyone’s eyes widen!<br/><br/>“As for his combat strength, I will only be able to confirm it when I have a clash with the Heaven’s origin creation! ”<br/><br/>This was Wang Xian’s second sentence!<br/><br/>Yes, he was going to have a duel with the Heaven’s origin creation!<br/><br/>The Heaven’s origin creation powerhouses from the sword and Magic Universe would definitely have a duel with Wang Xian!<br/><br/>This was because after Wang Xian had dealt with the space forbidden ground.<br/><br/>He would have to deal with the matters of the flowing water forbidden ground! Some of the powerhouses in the flowing water forbidden ground would have to die!<br/><br/>“This? Brother, brother-in-law, I will be your brother-in-law from now on. From now on, you will be my biggest thigh. ”<br/><br/>When Long Yinhao heard this sentence, his face was full of excitement as he roared!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
