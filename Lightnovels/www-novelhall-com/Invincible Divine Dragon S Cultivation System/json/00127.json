Take this crescent moon Illumination Numinous Treasure First and capture some peak-stage godly monarch-level desolate beasts.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian instructed the sky array.<br/><br/>It would take at least a month to tame a universe knight-level first-stage desolate beast. During this period, he could let the sky array capture some peak-stage godly monarch-level desolate beasts first. This would save a lot of time.<br/><br/>With the crescent moon shining on this numinous treasure, capturing the desolate beasts was a piece of cake.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The Heaven Array nodded.<br/><br/>Next, Wang Xian began to tame the venerable level turtle-winged beast. The Heaven Array went to capture some desolate beasts at the peak of the divine emperor realm in the water to prepare for the following matters.<br/><br/>“Damn it, what exactly happened to the Dragon’s face? The life token broke and there’s no trace of it!”<br/><br/>Just as Wang Xian was taming the blazing turtle winged beast, the entire hall was filled with a depressing atmosphere.<br/><br/>Five old men sat in the middle. Below them, more than twenty old men were kneeling with cold sweat on their faces.<br/><br/>Something Big had happened!<br/><br/>The Venerable Dragon Mask had fallen!<br/><br/>The death of a venerable was a huge matter for the dragon race.<br/><br/>“The strength of the dragon face is considered top-notch among the level one venerables. He even has the Thunder Dragon Bone on him. It will be difficult to kill him unless a level two universe venerable makes a move.”<br/><br/>“That Wang Xian is a level two universe venerable? That’s impossible. Do you think it was venerable willow deity who made the move?”<br/><br/>“It shouldn’t be. Venerable Willow deity is a neutral venerable. She has her own principles. Even if she makes a move, she wouldn’t kill us, the Dragon Face Venerable.”<br/><br/>The five of them sat there, their expressions extremely solemn as they spoke.<br/><br/>This was the first universe knight that had fallen in the hundreds of millions of years of their dragon race.<br/><br/>Other than the fallen dragon face, there was also the Thunder Dragon Bone of the Knight level.<br/><br/>This was equivalent to them losing two knights.<br/><br/>How many knights were there in the entire Dragon Race?<br/><br/>This kind of loss was already extremely painful.<br/><br/>“There’s another possibility. That guy who tipped us off was lying to us. They had already set up an ambush and killed the dragon-faced man.”<br/><br/>An old man said faintly.<br/><br/>“Investigate, we must investigate thoroughly. Find the enemy and use the power of the entire dragon-descendant race.”<br/><br/>The dragon-descendant leader in the middle said in a deep voice.<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>The group of people kneeling in front immediately responded.<br/><br/>They had to investigate the death of the dragon-faced venerable.<br/><br/>They also understood that this was definitely related to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“With the strength of the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect, it’s impossible for them to destroy the elders of our nine swords tribe.”<br/><br/>“Investigate, find out who entered the Crescent Mystic Realm again. Find out who killed them and avenge the elders!”<br/><br/>Just as the dragon-descendant race was furious and searching for information about the death of dragon-faced knight, the Universe Knight level great being of the nine-blade race also gave an order with a face full of anger.<br/><br/>The death of eight elders was a huge loss to the nine-blade race.<br/><br/>They had to find out who did it, and make them pay the price.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>As the days went by, the entire Milky Way seemed to be in a state of turmoil.<br/><br/>Some other forces noticed the abnormality of the dragon race and the nine-sword race and revealed astonished expressions.<br/><br/>The two primary races of the Milky Way universe used all their strength to search for some information at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>However, when their race was in operation, information was quickly transmitted to their race.<br/><br/>The first piece of news was about Wang Xian breaking through to the level of a universe knight.<br/><br/>All the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect knew about this, so they were the quickest to investigate.<br/><br/>When they received this news, the nine swords race had basically determined the murderer of their Race’s elder.<br/><br/>As for the dragon-descendant race, they could basically confirm that the death of the dragon-faced venerable was probably the work of that Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Following that, the two great races activated all their powers to search for information about Wang Xian.<br/><br/>However, it was not so easy this time.<br/><br/>Senior Brother Junzi and the rest stayed in seclusion in the willow deity Daoist sect.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was now powerful and possessed the eight luminaries dragon scale. They could not lock onto him at all.<br/><br/>This made the two great races like headless flies.<br/><br/>“Phew!”<br/><br/>At the same time, a month passed very quickly. Wang Xian took a deep breath and looked at the turtle-winged beast that was completely tamed. A smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>Taming the turtle-winged beast in a month was already very fast.<br/><br/>“Buzz!”<br/><br/>After contacting the Heaven Formation, he quickly received a reply.<br/><br/>“Have you captured six peak celestial emperor level aquatic dire beasts in a month’s time?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and revealed a satisfied expression.<br/><br/>He immediately informed Mi Xin Lu and posted the information of the Celestial Palace’s war pets selling six peak celestial emperor level war pets on the AI.<br/><br/>When Mi Xin Lu received the order, she immediately posted the information on the AI.<br/><br/>Soon, a piece of information regarding the Celestial Palace’s war pets was sent out from the universe’s AI.<br/><br/>The Immortal Palace’s War Pets would be sold with six peak god-emperor level war pets and a large number of other war pets.<br/><br/>This time, the method of selling the war pets was not the same as before. Instead, they would be bought on the spot.<br/><br/>They would be sold by drawing lots.<br/><br/>The reason why they would be sold in this way was that Wang Xian wanted to gather all the forces in the Milky Way and announce something.<br/><br/>He wanted to prepare for the following matters.<br/><br/>When the information about the Immortal Palace War Pets was released, it immediately caused a huge commotion.<br/><br/>Peak-stage Celestial Emperor War Pets, and they were also peak-stage Celestial Emperor War Pets. Furthermore, there were six of them.<br/><br/>“Hiss, this immortal palace war pets are so awesome. This time, they actually sold six peak-stage Celestial Emperor War Pets. This is too crazy!”<br/><br/>“What kind of force are these immortal palace war pets from? They are definitely a powerful primary race in the universe.”<br/><br/>“There must be a universe knight behind this Immortal Palace War Pet. A few pinnacle god Emperor War Pets are sold, this is too fierce!”<br/><br/>“This is probably another grand gathering, it will definitely be fought over by all the major powers!”<br/><br/>In the Milky Way, countless people looked at this news, their faces full of shock and discussion.<br/><br/>When the various races saw this news, they immediately got ready.<br/><br/>Even among the primary races in the universe, a battle pet at the peak of the divine emperor realm was considered to have the highest combat strength.<br/><br/>Not to mention its importance to the domain-level races.<br/><br/>Looking at the information that was bubbling up in the universe’s AI, Wang Xian revealed a smile.<br/><br/>Little did they know that this was just the appetizer.<br/><br/>The next highlight was the auction of the Immortal Palace’s Battle Pets.<br/><br/>“I need to change to another ship. I can’t be as shabby as before. Also, I Need the Heaven Formation to show its strength this time around to create a powerful and mysterious feeling.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled to himself as he made a plan in his heart.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
