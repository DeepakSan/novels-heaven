The strongest warrior of the Dragon God’s bloodline is probably the Dragon King of the Devil Dragon’s bloodline. He’s probably only a level 6 universe knight. Our Saint Wen Clan isn’t afraid at all.”<br/><br/>The elder of the Saint Wen Clan said calmly.<br/><br/>In the surrounding starry sky, according to the power displayed by the Dragon God’s bloodline, the strongest warrior was at level 5 universe knights.<br/><br/>Even though they had many treasures, the holy prose clan was not afraid of the Dragon bloodline at all.<br/><br/>Even though the dragon bloodline might give birth to a level 6 universe knight, they were not afraid at all.<br/><br/>“It’s the clan leader!”<br/><br/>The holy prose clan nodded, and the light lotus continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>“HM?”<br/><br/>When the holy prose clan arrived, it immediately attracted the attention of all the members of the Water Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Feeling the power coming from them, all the members of the Water Dragon Palace felt a chill in their hearts.<br/><br/>“What’s going on? What are they doing here?”<br/><br/>“What’s going on?”<br/><br/>The members of the Water Dragon King were slightly surprised.<br/><br/>“Clan leader, they’re from the holy prose clan.”<br/><br/>An expert of the Water Dragon Palace said from the side.<br/><br/>“Let’s go and take a look.”<br/><br/>The Water Dragon King looked puzzled and immediately flew out.<br/><br/>Hearing this name, Tian Chen’s eyes sparkled as he followed closely.<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>“Sir from the Dragon Palace, you can wait in the Dragon King Palace.”<br/><br/>The Water Dragon King looked at Tian Chen and said.<br/><br/>“They might be looking for our Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Sky array shook his head and squinted his eyes.<br/><br/>“Looking for the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>Water Dragon King frowned when he heard sky array.<br/><br/>“Saint Wen Clan, May I know why you are here?”<br/><br/>Water Dragon King looked at the Knights of the Saint Wen Clan and said seriously.<br/><br/>There were almost 4,000 knights of the Saint Wen Clan on the light lotus.<br/><br/>The Saint Wen clan was not weak in Lu Xingkong.<br/><br/>“We’re here to find the people from the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>The clan leader of the Saint Wen Clan on the light lotus narrowed his eyes and said, “Tell the people from the Dragon Palace to come out!”<br/><br/>“Hehe, Saint Wen Clan, why are you looking for the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>Tian Chen stared at them and said coldly.<br/><br/>“What’s the matter? was our third elder, seventh elder, killed by Your Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>The clan leader of the Holy Prose clan asked with a grim face.<br/><br/>“Who’s third elder and seventh elder? Our Dragon Palace killed a lot of people who didn’t know what was good for them. Who knows which one of them is your third elder and seventh elder?”<br/><br/>Tian Cheng glanced at them and replied coldly.<br/><br/>“Hehe, Your Dragon Palace is really arrogant. Our third elder and seventh elder of the holy prose clan died at the hands of that Space Beast of your Dragon Palace. Why? Don’t you admit it?”<br/><br/>An elder beside the clan leader of the Saint Wen Clan asked in a stern voice.<br/><br/>“Admit it? Are you saying that those two who directly attacked us over ten days ago didn’t know death?”<br/><br/>Tian Chen said coldly.<br/><br/>“Impudent!”<br/><br/>“Dragon Palace, you dare to kill an elder of our Saint Wen Clan? You must pay the price!”<br/><br/>The clan leader of the Saint Wen clan shouted with a cold face.<br/><br/>“Haha, with Just You?”<br/><br/>Sky array laughed loudly and said disdainfully.<br/><br/>“With just us.”<br/><br/>The holy prose clan leader said coldly.<br/><br/>“They are taking advantage of the situation. They know that your Dragon Palace is here to help us, and they know that the Devil Dragon Clan is going to make a move against our Water Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>On the side, Water Dragon Emperor’s expression was unusually dark when he saw this.<br/><br/>Fire Dragon Emperor had the power of a Level 6 universe knight, they were even more worried about the power of the Devil Dragon Bloodline.<br/><br/>Luckily, there were level 6 universe knights in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>But now the Saint Wen Clan was attacking the Dragon Palace, they obviously wanted to use this chance to take revenge.<br/><br/>The Saint Wen clan wasn’t weak, they were even stronger than Water Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>This was like adding insult to injury!<br/><br/>Their hope was completely destroyed by the intervention of the holy prose clan.<br/><br/>“Members of the Fire Dragon Palace, the enemy of the enemy is a friend. The Dragon Palace killed an elder of the holy prose clan. This time, the holy prose clan will make the Dragon Palace pay the price!”<br/><br/>The Patriarch of the Holy Prose clan looked at the Fire Dragon Palace and said with a smile.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, good, good, good. The enemy of the enemy is a friend. We have made a friend of the holy prose clan!”<br/><br/>The arrival of the holy prose clan in the Fire Dragon Palace had attracted the attention of the Fire Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Hearing their words, the fire dragon lord burst into laughter.<br/><br/>He flew out of the Fire Dragon Palace and looked at the holy prose clan and the Water Dragon King Sky Array. His eyes were full of coldness as he said, “When the Devil Dragon Clan arrives, we will destroy them completely.”<br/><br/>“Hehe, good, a small dragon palace, leave it to us!”<br/><br/>The leader of the Saint Wen clan laughed and replied.<br/><br/>“HM? Haha, Good, Good!”<br/><br/>Fire Dragon Master heard their words and laughed.<br/><br/>His eyes gleamed.<br/><br/>The Saint Wen Clan didn’t know that there was a level 6 universe knight in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>However, he didn’t say it out loud.<br/><br/>With the holy prose clan interfering, it would be easier for them, and they would be able to reduce the number of Ya Long’s deaths.<br/><br/>“One holy prose clan wants to destroy us? Then let’s see who’s going to destroy who!”<br/><br/>Sky Array’s eyes were cold and cold.<br/><br/>“Hu!”<br/><br/>However, Water Dragon Emperor let out a breath, his face filled with exhaustion.<br/><br/>“The Devil Dragon Clan and the holy prose clan… we… We are no match for them. Once they break through our water dragon palace, we will be finished.”<br/><br/>“We… We have to prepare some escape routes!”<br/><br/>The Water Dragon King looked at sky array and said weakly.<br/><br/>“Don’t worry, Water Dragon King. I will contact the Dragon King immediately and leave everything to our Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>The sky array’s face was also filled with coldness.<br/><br/>The sudden attack of the holy prose clan made him a little angry.<br/><br/>The two elders of the holy prose clan had attacked them when they knew that Xiao Lan had a master. It was a complete provocation.<br/><br/>After killing them, the holy prose clan still dared to come and take revenge?<br/><br/>And they dared to take advantage of the situation at this time?<br/><br/>Then they would have to see who was going to kill who!<br/><br/>“HMM? You… Your Dragon Palace has an idea?”<br/><br/>The Water Dragon King stared at the sky array with a hint of excitement in his eyes.<br/><br/>“Everything will be decided by the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The sky array replied faintly. It took out the universal AI and immediately transmitted the situation over.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the entire surrounding Lu Xingkong was paying attention to the situation at the Water Dragon Palace.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
