Hit<br/><br/>“Thousand eyes, Blood Fiend!”<br/><br/>Hundred Cities Alliance master flew towards Wang Xian. He waved the staff in his hand and the blood-red eyes on it glowed.<br/><br/>At his chest, the red eyes were also emitting a blood-red glow.<br/><br/>The blood-red glow gathered together and formed a gigantic blood eye in the sky!<br/><br/>The Blood Eye was staring at Wang Xian, emitting a strange energy.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian saw the leader of the hundred cities rushing over and felt the strange power of the blood eye in the sky ahead. He raised his eyebrows slightly.<br/><br/>He felt that the space around him seemed to be sealed. He felt as if there were countless eyes staring at him!<br/><br/>This was a very strange feeling!<br/><br/>“Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the Hundred City Alliance Master in front of him let out a wild roar, and his entire body suddenly changed!<br/><br/>His body expanded by more than 10,000 times, and on his head was an incomparably huge demonic dragon head!<br/><br/>On his chest were numerous blood-red eyes.<br/><br/>On his back was a metallic tail, emitting a strange and evil aura.<br/><br/>The leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance was like a demonic boss from a different world!<br/><br/>“HMPH!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian snorted softly. His eyes were filled with killing intent. He raised his head and roared, “Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>With a dragon’s roar, he transformed into a divine dragon.<br/><br/>The Divine Dragon was emitting a nine-colored glow in his vision. In the eyes of all the living beings in the outside world, he belonged to the Green Dragon.<br/><br/>It was a green dragon that might have mutated!<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian still didn’t know how powerful the leaf that the elf tribe had given him was.<br/><br/>He also didn’t know that it was a treasure given to him by an invincible expert in this universe.<br/><br/>Facing the leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance, Wang Xian displayed his full strength.<br/><br/>The lineage of wizards was a very strange and terrifying lineage!<br/><br/>A powerful ancestral wizard was an existence that made all the peak races very fearful.<br/><br/>“Eight-sided Dragon Pillar!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian growled and released his law projection. Numerous divine dragon phantoms blasted towards the Bai Cheng Alliance leader.<br/><br/>In the next moment, the primaless saint wings on his body flapped!<br/><br/>“All beings, your horizons!”<br/><br/>The Bai Cheng Alliance leader raised the staff in his hand which had also enlarged. Each of them had huge red eyes as they faced the eight divine dragons.<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>A terrifying collision sound was heard!<br/><br/>“Our Alliance Master is fighting with this powerhouse from the Dragon Palace. The opponent is a purebred divine dragon!”<br/><br/>“It should be a purebred divine dragon. What Pure Dragon Aura. This is the powerhouse from the Dragon Palace who destroyed Daming City.”<br/><br/>“The opponent is very strong. Will our alliance master be able to fight against him?”<br/><br/>“Our Alliance master has been breaking through to the third stage of the Universe Dominator for close to 10 billion years. The accumulation of these 10 billion years is definitely not the average third stage of the universe dominator who is weak. Furthermore, our alliance master is a wizard.”<br/><br/>The battle between Wang Xian and the Alliance Master of hundred cities erupted. At hundred cities peak, countless of strong disciples immediately flew to the sky and watched the battle.<br/><br/>They stared intently and discussed among themselves.<br/><br/>One was a purebred divine dragon, and the other was their alliance master, a powerful wizard.<br/><br/>Naturally, they hoped that their alliance master would win. However, the other party was also a divine dragon!<br/><br/>They didn’t dare to make a hasty conclusion about who would win!<br/><br/>The eight dragon pillars collided with each other with red eyes. The energy of both parties began to dissipate.<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian’s speed was pushed to the limit as he arrived at the position on his right.<br/><br/>While Wang Xian was moving, the gigantic blood eye in the sky was looking at the position where he was flying.<br/><br/>A hint of shock appeared in the eyes of the Bai Cheng Alliance Master. His golden tail immediately moved.<br/><br/>“Golden Dragon Leaf!”<br/><br/>He growled and swept towards Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Eh? He actually reacted. This is strange!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw that the other party was able to keep up with his speed, a look of shock appeared on his face.<br/><br/>It couldn’t be said that he was catching up. Instead, the other party had predicted where he would appear and retaliated directly.<br/><br/>“The divine tail plays with the Pearl!”<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian didn’t Dodge. Similarly, he used his dragon tail to sweep towards him.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>The Dragon Might and the golden tail collided.<br/><br/>Black cracks appeared in the space where the collision occurred.<br/><br/>The expression of the alliance master of Bai City changed slightly. His body couldn’t help but fly backward.<br/><br/>“Yi, Nan Jiao, Mei Gu, Shuo Fang, blood line Ember!”<br/><br/>He waved the staff in his hand and roared in a low voice.<br/><br/>In the next moment, blood-red lines appeared in front of him and attacked Wang Xian directly.<br/><br/>The blood-red lines were densely packed and covered the entire space!<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian roared in a low voice. His body was covered by a thick layer of soil. At the same time, the Tai Chi Dragon Plate appeared around him.<br/><br/>Waves of light and darkness energy were injected into the dragon plate, forming a terrifying defense.<br/><br/>With the instigation of the uninitiated holy wing mountain, his figure disappeared once again.<br/><br/>“What a fast speed!”<br/><br/>The expression of the leader of Bai Cheng changed slightly. The blood eye in the sky looked towards a direction and he quickly reacted.<br/><br/>“It’s the blood eye in the sky. It seems to be able to see through its own actions!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian saw many thin lines suddenly converging towards him. His gaze focused as he sensed the change in the blood eye in the sky. His eyes flickered!<br/><br/>“Mighty Heavenly Dragon!”<br/><br/>He waved his Dragon Claw and a divine dragon attacked the blood eye directly.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>The next moment, he moved his palm and the five elements millstone appeared in his hand. He smashed it directly at the Bai Cheng Alliance leader.<br/><br/>“Horn constellation, Kang constellation, Di constellation, room constellation, xin constellation, Wei constellation, Ji Constellation, Demonic Dragon Formation!”<br/><br/>The Bai Cheng Alliance leader looked over and his expression turned serious. He opened his dragon mouth and spat out waves of energy.<br/><br/>The power of darkness quickly formed a formation and a demonic dragon attacked Wang Xian directly.<br/><br/>“HMPH!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian saw that the inoriginator holy wings were flapped and instantly attacked the blood eye in the sky.<br/><br/>The Demonic Dragon Formation covered the mighty heavenly dragon and the five elements grinding mill, but it was unable to stop Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>The Dragon Claw swept over and Wang Xian directly attacked the blood-red eye in the sky.<br/><br/>“Crash!”<br/><br/>In the next moment, the incipient holy wings were flapped. Wang Xian’s figure disappeared as he attacked the chief of the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>The blood-red eyes on the chief of the Hundred Cities Alliance were scanning the surroundings uneasily, capturing Wang Xian’s figure.<br/><br/>“He’s too fast. How can his speed be so fast? This has quite a great restraint on wizards!”<br/><br/>When the eyes on his body caught sight of Wang Xian, the chief of the Hundred Cities Alliance’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly dodged to the side.<br/><br/>“Towering Dragon Horn!”<br/><br/>On Wang Xian’s dragon horn, a terrifying energy penetrated through alliance master Bai Cheng.<br/><br/>“Red eye world repelling!”<br/><br/>Alliance master Bai Cheng roared furiously. One Eye after another emitted a blood-red glow. The glow enveloped him. In the next moment, it was as if he was in another world.<br/><br/>The energy from the towering dragon horn penetrated through him. It did not penetrate his body. It only penetrated a red mist.<br/><br/>In the next moment, the body of Hundred Cities Alliance master seemed to appear in this universe once again.<br/><br/>However, drops of blood seeped out from the red eyes on his chest.<br/><br/>Clearly, he had paid a price!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
