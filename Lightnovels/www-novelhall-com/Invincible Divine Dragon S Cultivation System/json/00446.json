The Five Elements Millstone had already arrived above her head.<br/><br/>“You… you… you have been hiding your strength. How did it happen? How did you become so strong?”<br/><br/>Feeling her life force disappearing rapidly, the cave master of the Demoness Cave was filled with disbelief and fear.<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled faintly. His eyes were filled with disdain.<br/><br/>“It’s easy to kill you!”<br/><br/>As he spoke, the life force of the cave master disappeared rapidly.<br/><br/>Wang Xian kept the corpse and waved his arm. A surge of energy surged in the surroundings.<br/><br/>A few seconds later, his body moved and he flew towards the area below.<br/><br/>“HMM? Win?”<br/><br/>When Qing longyue saw Wang Xian flying down, she raised her eyebrows and smiled.<br/><br/>“Congratulations!”<br/><br/>He congratulated.<br/><br/>“Hehe, I will be neighbors with brother Qing longyue from now on!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and cupped his hands.<br/><br/>“As expected, it was this master who won!”<br/><br/>“Judging from the initial collision, this master is stronger!”<br/><br/>“A cave master has changed. The cave master of the demoness must have escaped!”<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, some people were discussing.<br/><br/>This was because they did not hear the screams of the cave master. Instinctively, they thought that she had already escaped back to her divine kingdom.<br/><br/>After all, it would be difficult to kill someone of the same level.<br/><br/>The prying eyes in the surrounding cave abode quickly disappeared.<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved and flew towards the cave abode of the cave master of the Female Demon Cave. The stone tablet placed at the side was shattered by his arm.<br/><br/>He entered the cave residence of the Demoness Cave and found that there was nothing inside.<br/><br/>When the battle ended just now, some of the experts in the cave residence of the demoness had already taken the items away and left.<br/><br/>The entire cave residence was over 10,000 kilometers in size and had magnificent buildings.<br/><br/>These buildings were left behind by the Lotus race.<br/><br/>It was once the residence of the strongest experts of the lotus race.<br/><br/>Wang Xian strolled around inside. The energy here was abnormally abundant, and it was very suitable for cultivation.<br/><br/>He made some arrangements and waved his arm to release the purple lightning snake to guard the entrance.<br/><br/>He entered the palace in the middle.<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>At this moment, he suddenly sensed that the water lotus he had just obtained had undergone a change.<br/><br/>He kept the third-grade water lotus immediately after he obtained it.<br/><br/>The ancestral tree absorbed it automatically.<br/><br/>However, at this moment, he realized that the third-grade water lotus had disappeared.<br/><br/>The sixth-grade water lotus beside him was a little bigger than when he had just obtained it.<br/><br/>The small water lotus had merged into the sixth-grade water lotus?<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed for a moment and confirmed the answer.<br/><br/>“I really didn’t expect that the ancestral tree could allow the water lotus to merge and improve rapidly. If I had enough water lotus, I would be able to raise the sixth-grade water lotus to the ninth-grade quickly.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. With a move of his body, he arrived at the entrance of the cave abode.<br/><br/>With a move of his palm, he left a line of words in front of the cave abode.<br/><br/>He had to pay a high price for water lotus of various grades.<br/><br/>Although the words were a little vulgar, they were definitely useful.<br/><br/>As one of the twelve cave masters of the Heavenly River Lotus Peak, he had a great reputation.<br/><br/>His status was definitely not weaker than the chiefs of some big cities and some races.<br/><br/>After all, the cave master of the lotus peak of the Heavenly River had the combat strength of A Level One universe dominator.<br/><br/>After inscribing this character, he returned to the cave abode once again and threw the corpse of the cave master of the Demoness Cave into the Dragon Palace to upgrade Shui Linglong’s father.<br/><br/>Shui Linglong’s father was water dragon. If he made a breakthrough, he would be the level one combat strength of the Universe Dominator, water dragon.<br/><br/>This might be of great use to the Heavenly River.<br/><br/>All Wang Xian sent a message to the Heaven Array, asking him to come to the river of eternity.<br/><br/>Now that the Heaven Array had completed its breakthrough, it already possessed the combat strength of a level one universe dominator.<br/><br/>Within this level, it was also an invincible existence.<br/><br/>The main reason why Wang Xian asked him to come over was to let him stay in the cave abode and set up some formations around it.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Soon, the Heaven Formation arrived and greeted him.<br/><br/>“Okay!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and instructed him.<br/><br/>This included the fact that if he were to leave, someone would come to sell the water lotus and let the Heaven Formation buy it.<br/><br/>“Alright, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The Heaven Formation nodded. This was a small matter.<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved his palm and took the ancient blueprint. It showed that there was a water lotus here.<br/><br/>This should be a water lotus that had an owner.<br/><br/>He moved his body and flew out. He decided to search for it in the surroundings.<br/><br/>If he could get his hands on some water lotus, be it to be used as a weapon or to be devoured by himself, it would be extremely beneficial to him.<br/><br/>After flying from the Lotus Peak, Wang Xian flew towards the place where the water in the sky fell.<br/><br/>According to the information from the Green Dragon Moon, there might be a ninth-grade water lotus there. There might even be a legendary twelfth-grade water lotus there.<br/><br/>However, there was a terrifying space beast there.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was not arrogant enough to think that he was a match for that Space Beast.<br/><br/>However, he was unwilling to not take a look. The main reason was that there was an ancient blueprint.<br/><br/>He had a special method!<br/><br/>He shuttled through the river of eternity at a fast speed. Occasionally, he would bump into some desolate beasts.<br/><br/>The desolate beasts here were also very powerful. If he was not careful, he would be heavily injured. He might even die from a sneak attack.<br/><br/>Wang Xian also had to be more cautious.<br/><br/>For the next month, he was traveling at a rapid speed.<br/><br/>With the ancient blueprint, he did not need to search carefully like the others.<br/><br/>The scope of the ancient blueprint was huge. It was so huge that he had to fly for dozens of minutes.<br/><br/>This allowed him to explore the water lotus abnormally fast.<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>After flying for two months, a huge rumbling sound came from the front.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked over and his eyes revealed a look of shock.<br/><br/>In the sky, waves of terrifying water currents descended. The terrifying power and sound spread far and wide.<br/><br/>This was an incomparably vast waterfall.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian’s gaze landed on the ancient blueprint.<br/><br/>Just as Green Dragon Moon had said, there were water lotuses under the water in the sky.<br/><br/>Moreover, on the ancient blueprint, the water ripples formed four to five water lotuses. This meant that there were four to five water lotuses in this area.<br/><br/>“The nearest one is also at the edge of the water in the sky. If I go over there by myself, I might be able to trigger that space behemoth!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the information on the ancient blueprint and frowned slightly.<br/><br/>Actually, he had a solution, and that was an lie.<br/><br/>An lie had the ancient oil lamp. He had accumulated a lot of vitality fluid over the past ten years. The defense of the ancient oil lamp should be able to withstand a strike from a true ruler of the universe.<br/><br/>This was also the reason why he came here to take a look.<br/><br/>“I can let an lie take the risk to pluck the water lotus at the edge. As for the depths, I’ll let an lie act according to the situation.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled and immediately contacted an lie.<br/><br/>Very soon, an Lie’s figure appeared in front of the demon spirit altar in front of him!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
