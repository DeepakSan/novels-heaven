He looked at Wang Xian with a fearful expression.<br/><br/>“Oh? Is That So?”<br/><br/>“But why did I hear you guys looking for me just now?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at them expressionlessly.<br/><br/>“Junior brother Wang Xian, we are just a little curious. We have no other intentions.”<br/><br/>A young man said hurriedly.<br/><br/>“You Want Me to Die?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them with a slightly mocking expression.<br/><br/>“No, how is that possible? We are from the same sect. Why would we want you to die?”<br/><br/>The three of them shook their heads quickly.<br/><br/>“Junior brother, is that something you guys can call him?”<br/><br/>Killing intent appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes as his figure disappeared instantly.<br/><br/>“Not good, he wants to kill us!”<br/><br/>The middle-aged man in the middle shouted sternly. A willow leaf appeared in his hand instantly.<br/><br/>“Pu!”<br/><br/>A piercing sound came from the side, followed by a sense of death.<br/><br/>A green shield appeared around him, blocking the attack that could kill him.<br/><br/>“Pu!”<br/><br/>But at this time, a piercing sound came from the other side.<br/><br/>He opened his eyes wide and felt the life force of the two junior brothers on both sides quickly disappear.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>In the next moment, his figure disappeared.<br/><br/>“You’re courting death.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian glanced at the middle-aged man who had escaped and looked at the two corpses beside him.<br/><br/>These two people were only at the first level and second level of celestial thearch. Yet, they dared to have designs on him. It was obvious that they didn’t know their own fate.<br/><br/>The two of them didn’t even have the time to take out the fallen leaves to return to their destination.<br/><br/>They were too close to Wang Xian. They couldn’t even see the end of Wang Xian’s attack.<br/><br/>Only the middle-aged man who was at level six of the celestial thearch reacted in an instant. He was saved by the fallen leaves on their way back.<br/><br/>However, that was all. The next time there was no fallen leaves on their way back, he would still die.<br/><br/>“Wang Xian, you actually dared to kill your fellow disciples here. You will die a horrible death!”<br/><br/>At this moment, an extremely angry voice sounded in the sky above the willow deity Daoist sect.<br/><br/>Suddenly, a roar filled with anger and fear alarmed everyone in the willow deity Daoist rite temple.<br/><br/>“What happened?”<br/><br/>“What happened? Wang Xian? He killed his fellow disciples?”<br/><br/>“Who is the one who is standing up for the icy mountains and rivers?”<br/><br/>In the Willow deity Daoist rite temple, all the disciples were slightly shocked. They immediately flew to the sky and looked towards the source of the voice.<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>When they saw the middle-aged man floating there, they were slightly surprised and flew over curiously.<br/><br/>“Die a horrible death? You Dare to follow me? You are courting death. This time, the fallen leaves have saved your life. I would like to see who can save you next time.”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard the middle-aged man’s fierce roar, he stared at him coldly.<br/><br/>Sensing his gaze, the middle-aged man felt a chill in his heart and his forehead was filled with cold sweat.<br/><br/>The other party had the ability to kill him in an instant. This time, he was able to survive because of venerable willow deity’s return journey. He would not be so lucky next time.<br/><br/>He swallowed a mouthful of saliva and did not dare to be arrogant anymore.<br/><br/>He was really afraid that Wang Xian would lock onto him. His unbridled manner made the middle-aged man fearful.<br/><br/>He actually dared to attack them at the entrance of the Willow deity Daoist sect and even killed two of his junior brothers.<br/><br/>This was… Crazy!<br/><br/>“Junior Brother Zhuge? What Happened?”<br/><br/>In the sky above the willow deity Daoist sect, the disciples flew to the side of the middle-aged man and asked with a frown.<br/><br/>Senior Brother Junzi also flew over with a frown. He looked at Wang Xian who was in front of him.<br/><br/>“Senior brother Yu Yuetian, that Wang Xian…”. “That Wang Xian just killed San Shui, Qing, and junior brothers. He attacked us directly. I reacted quickly and escaped with my life through the fallen leaves. However, San Shui, Qing, and junior brothers are all dead.”<br/><br/>“Senior brother Yu Yuetian, you must stand up for your two Junior Brothers!”<br/><br/>The middle-aged man clenched his fists tightly and said with a face full of fear.<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>“San Shui, Qing, and junior brother were killed by that Wang Xian? He killed two more junior brothers?”<br/><br/>“He attacked you guys directly in front of the entrance of our Divine Willow Daoist sect and killed two of them? This is too unscrupulous!”<br/><br/>“What is he trying to do? In just a few months, he has killed five disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect. Is he here to kill the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect on purpose?”<br/><br/>Angry Voices came out from the mouths of the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect.<br/><br/>A few of the elders also frowned. Their expressions were somewhat unsightly.<br/><br/>“HMPH, if you want to kill me and dare to plot against me, you must be prepared to die. It’s the same for everyone.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian heard the voices in the Divine Willow Daoist sect and warned them coldly.<br/><br/>After he finished speaking, his body moved and entered the ocean below. He brought along Mi Xin Lu, who was on the great mill of the five elements, and left immediately.<br/><br/>“Arrogant, he’s simply too arrogant. He killed his fellow disciples in front of the Divine Willow Daoist sect. In just a few months, five of his disciples died at his hands. How did such a cruel person enter our Divine Willow Daoist sect?”<br/><br/>A middle-aged man shouted angrily.<br/><br/>“Hey, why are you following junior brother Wang Xian?”<br/><br/>At the side, senior brother Junzi shook his head and looked at the middle-aged man helplessly.<br/><br/>“Senior brother Junzi, even if we were to follow him, it wouldn’t be to the extent of killing two junior brothers, right?”<br/><br/>A woman asked with an embarrassed expression.<br/><br/>“Junior brother Wang Xian’s Dao is different from ours. He is decisive in his killing. If he has no enmity with junior brother Wang Xian, don’t have any bad thoughts towards him. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have any scruples.”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Junzi reminded him helplessly.<br/><br/>“Does he really think he can kill whoever he wants? His strength is at most at the ninth level of the divine emperor realm. With such strength, he doesn’t have the right to be unscrupulous.”<br/><br/>An old man said coldly.<br/><br/>“We don’t know what method this fellow used to enter the willow deity Daoist sect. We should report to Venerable Willow Deity and expel him.”<br/><br/>A middle-aged man said in a deep voice.<br/><br/>The others shook their heads when they heard his words.<br/><br/>Among them, which one of them had seen venerable willow deity’s real body?<br/><br/>None of them.<br/><br/>Venerable willow deity did not care about these matters at all.<br/><br/>“Zhuge, this matter is because of Bingling Hongtu and the others. If you let Bingling Hongtu’s ice mountain race take action, it shouldn’t be a big problem for the ice mountain race to destroy that Wang Xian.”<br/><br/>Someone suggested.<br/><br/>Some people took a look and left immediately without participating.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Brother Wang, those three fellows are really annoying. They actually followed us. One look and you can tell that they are up to no good. Doesn’t the willow deity Daoist sect need to test their temperament? How can someone like them enter the willow deity Daoist sect?”<br/><br/>At the same time, on the vast surface of the Milky Way, Mi Xin Lu spoke with slight anger.<br/><br/>Following a person was such a taboo matter. He would be courting death if he were to be killed.<br/><br/>“The human heart is unpredictable. It’s impossible for the venerable willow deity to guarantee that the human heart will not change. Furthermore, when he passed the test back then, he might have a good temperament.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled faintly and didn’t mind it.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
