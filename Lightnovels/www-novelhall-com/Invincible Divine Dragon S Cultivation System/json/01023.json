Without any hesitation, he quickly hid behind.<br/><br/>“What a terrifying attack! ”<br/><br/>Looking from afar, Wang Xian stared ahead.<br/><br/>The Shadow of a Demon God appeared on the ninth level of the abyss of Demonic Beasts.<br/><br/>At the highest point of his head, his feet were on the ground.<br/><br/>A hug enveloped the entire world!<br/><br/>“I’m afraid that the Demon Hunter king is going to win. After devouring the other two demonic beasts, can he advance to the Heaven’s origin realm? If he can achieve that, it would be terrifying! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled to himself with a face full of shock!<br/><br/>When the space was enveloped, a terrifying roar came from within!<br/><br/>“You can actually borrow the power of the agar heaven-mad demon god. How is this possible? How can you be the agar heaven-mad Demon God?”<br/><br/>“We are the limbs of the agar heaven-mad demon god that are stained with blood. We were born from the Heaven and Earth’s destiny. We no longer belong to you. Why Are You Devouring Us?”<br/><br/>“Unless there is only one possibility. There is only one possibility, and that is that the Asgard Heavenly Demon God has already fallen. You have invaded the demon hunter King’s body and replaced him. You Want to live a Second Life! ”<br/><br/>In the darkness, the voice of the rotten bird and the scaly ox sounded in shock and anger!<br/><br/>They were filled with disbelief and disbelief!<br/><br/>The Demon Hunter King had been invaded.<br/><br/>The current Demon Hunter King was no longer the previous demon Hunter King!<br/><br/>His consciousness had already been taken over by Asgard!<br/><br/>And why would a heavenly Yuan creation Occupy Demon Hunter King’s body?<br/><br/>There was only one possibility, and that was that Asgard, a heavenly yuan creation level demon god, had fallen due to special reasons!<br/><br/>That was why he wanted to use demon hunter King’s body to resurrect!<br/><br/>“Keke, it’s too late to know now. I’ve been waiting for this moment for a very, very long time. By devouring you, I have a 90% chance of returning to my peak. Die, you two! ”<br/><br/>Violent laughter came from inside.<br/><br/>Following that, Wang Xian saw a terrifying aura coming from inside!<br/><br/>A scream came from inside.<br/><br/>It lasted for a long time!<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at it with his eyes flickering slightly.<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>Just when Wang Xian thought that the inside was about to end…<br/><br/>All of a sudden, he saw a demonic beast that was emitting a terrifying luster.<br/><br/>One by one, symbols were revolving around him as it rushed out from the inside with blood all over its body!<br/><br/>It was flying towards Wang Xian!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw the figure rushing out, he raised his eyebrows slightly!<br/><br/>It was that type of Unicorn Ox!<br/><br/>His entire body was extremely miserable, and some of his scales had already disappeared!<br/><br/>His aura was extremely weak!<br/><br/>He tried his best to escape, and soon, he arrived in front of Wang Xian!<br/><br/>Wang Xian sized him up, and his eyes were sparkling.<br/><br/>This was a demonic beast that had surpassed the peak of the Dominator realm. It was a demonic beast that was born from the limbs of the Heaven’s origin creation!<br/><br/>The strength of this Lin Niu was not much weaker than him!<br/><br/>If he were to kill it, it would definitely be a terrifying resource!<br/><br/>The Lin Niu flew over here. At the back, the Asgardian demonic God did not immediately chase after him from the shadow of the Demonic God!<br/><br/>It could be that he was restrained by the decaying bird or some other reason.<br/><br/>He did not chase after him!<br/><br/>“This is an opportunity! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian saw it and his eyes shone with excitement!<br/><br/>He moved his body and was ready to make his move!<br/><br/>The moment Wang Xian made his move, Lin Niu, who was in front of him, also noticed him.<br/><br/>“Save me! ”<br/><br/>Lin Niu saw Wang Xian and his eyes revealed a look of pleading for help. He immediately transmitted his voice.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard it, he was slightly stunned and felt the energy in his body.<br/><br/>The current him was not as powerful as a powerhouse at the peak of the Universe Dominator!<br/><br/>“Whoosh! ”<br/><br/>He waved his arm and the galactic fragment appeared in his hand. It directly enveloped Lin Niu!<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not kill him. Instead, he trapped him!<br/><br/>“Let’s go quickly. The decaying bird’s attack before its death caused some trouble to the Aga Heavenly Demon God. However, he will be able to react very quickly. Let’s escape quickly. Otherwise, we will all be killed by him! ”<br/><br/>Lin Niu felt that he was trapped. He was also shocked by Wang Xian’s strength!<br/><br/>However, he still shouted anxiously!<br/><br/>If he stayed here and was captured by the Asgardian Demon God, he would definitely die!<br/><br/>If he left this place, there was still a chance for him to survive!<br/><br/>Therefore, at this moment, he didn’t care who Wang Xian was or what his intentions were!<br/><br/>“Alright, let’s Go! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian didn’t kill him. Instead, he took him and flew into the distance!<br/><br/>“Go to the front right. That’s my lair. There are some treasures there. Take the treasures away and escape to the upper level immediately! ”<br/><br/>Lin Niu continued!<br/><br/>“Alright! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head. With a wave of his arm, a surge of energy was injected into Lin Niu’s body!<br/><br/>As long as he moved, Lin Niu would die instantly!<br/><br/>He came to the front of the Linniu and a planet appeared beneath their bodies.<br/><br/>The planet brought them away at a terrifying speed!<br/><br/>Now that Wang Xian’s strength had increased, he had basically used up all the energy of the Heaven’s origin fragment!<br/><br/>After all, this was just a fragment.<br/><br/>With Wang Xian’s strength, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to control everything!<br/><br/>“Who… Who Are You? An expert from the sword and Magic Universe?”<br/><br/>Lin Niu saw them leaving quickly and felt their speed. He looked at Wang Xian and couldn’t help but ask.<br/><br/>As he spoke, his eyes were filled with vigilance.<br/><br/>However, he could also feel that there was an energy in his body that could destroy him in an instant!<br/><br/>“I guess so! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head with a smile on his face when he heard his words.<br/><br/>He was also sizing up this demonic beast with curiosity!<br/><br/>“What’s the situation in the ninth level of the Demonic Beast Abyss? Why did you guys gain intelligence?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at him and asked!<br/><br/>Demonic Beasts did not have intelligence. It was indeed a surprise that these three demonic beasts gained intelligence!<br/><br/>Of course, he could also guess something!<br/><br/>“We are demonic beasts born from the limbs and flesh of the heaven and earth. When I cultivated to the realm of the ruler of the universe, I gained powerful intelligence. ”<br/><br/>Lin Niu was silent for a moment before replying!<br/><br/>“The other two are also like this? Why did you two suddenly start fighting?”<br/><br/>“Then, after the Demon Hunter King devoured you guys, can you guys achieve a breakthrough?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued to ask him curiously.<br/><br/>(‘I don’t know. The Demon Hunter King and the rotten bird were both born from the flesh and blood of the Heaven’s origin. We share the same physique and bloodline. In the past, we didn’t have much hatred and didn’t fight each<br/><br/>“However, tens of millions of years ago, we suddenly sensed something. We sensed that as long as we devoured the other party, it was possible for us to become stronger. The Demon Hunter King and the rotten bird began to attack me and I retaliated! ”<br/><br/>Lin Niu replied!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
