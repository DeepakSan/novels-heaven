They might not be able to recover from their losses even when the catastrophe arrives. ”<br/><br/>“Yeah, the Phoenix race and the angel race have really provoked the wrong enemy. ”<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace is too powerful! ”<br/><br/>All the peak races in the surroundings looked at this scene in shock.<br/><br/>After witnessing the Dragon King’s terrifying strength, they were full of respect for the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>After all, this was a real battle technique.<br/><br/>Two existences at the peak of the ruler realm.<br/><br/>One was the Prince of the Fire Phoenix, and the other was the guardian of the Angel of light.<br/><br/>(‘I feel that the strength of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is at the peak of the ruler realm among the peak races. ”<br/><br/>“Almost. Judging from his relaxed appearance, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to kill three or four masters of the same level at the same time! ” A few rank 7 masters of the shamans were talking in low voices.<br/><br/>“HMM? How is this possible?”<br/><br/>At this moment, they were in the location of the nine-origin universe passage. When they couldn’t sense the situation in the giant star city.<br/><br/>The powerhouses of the angel race and the Phoenix race felt uneasy<br/><br/>However, because the two peak-stage ruler-level powerhouses stepped inside, their unease wasn’t intense!<br/><br/>But at this moment, they suddenly received a message.<br/><br/>It was from the Prince of the Fire Phoenix, Feng Yuntian, and the radiant Angel Protector, Ayres.<br/><br/>As the top-tier powerhouses of the two peak races, they naturally had resurrection treasures!<br/><br/>In fact, the treasures they resurrected could not be compared to ordinary resurrection treasures.<br/><br/>When they were killed and resurrected by Wang Xian, they immediately sent the news over.<br/><br/>This caused the faces of the powerhouses from the Angel Race and the Phoenix race to instantly turn gloomy.<br/><br/>The other ten peak races suddenly sensed the change in their auras. They raised their eyebrows slightly and revealed a look of astonishment in their eyes.<br/><br/>“Damn you, Dragon King! If he dares to kill a disciple of our Phoenix clan, our Phoenix clan will never let him go! We will start a war with him! ”<br/><br/>At this moment, a roar filled with killing intent and anger echoed in the whole world!<br/><br/>The Water Phoenix King was emitting a terrifying aura. He did not hide his aura at all and rushed toward the surroundings!<br/><br/>“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace! ”<br/><br/>Crack! Crack! Crack<br/><br/>The Radiant Angel King was also clenching his fists. His aura was extremely cold.<br/><br/>All the Phoenixes and angels had ugly expressions on their faces!<br/><br/>“If the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace dares to kill the disciples of My Angel clan, we’ll start an all-out War! ”<br/><br/>The Radiant Angel King also roared with a face full of killing intent.<br/><br/>There were a large number of their powerful disciples in the vast starry city. Even their two peak races couldn’t afford such a loss!<br/><br/>If those powerful disciples were all killed by the Dragon King, then their losses would be too great!<br/><br/>“Oh? What did the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace Do?”<br/><br/>The experts of the other peak races looked over in astonishment.<br/><br/>What on Earth had caused the Phoenix and Angel races to be so furious?<br/><br/>However, the blockade at the starry city was still ongoing.<br/><br/>No one could see what was happening inside.<br/><br/>In fact, the information inside could not be transmitted over.<br/><br/>Clearly, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the rest had completely sealed off the inside!<br/><br/>They could only wait quietly here.<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian was not there to watch the disciples of the dragon palace slaughter the strong disciples of the two peak races.<br/><br/>He appeared beside Lan Qingyue and dealt with the other four space beasts who were at the level seven of the Dominator realm!<br/><br/>In the battle here, Lan Qingyue, Xiao Lan, and the rest had always been at the upper hand. One of the space beasts was even severely injured by them!<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s appearance completely ended the battle.<br/><br/>With the help of the power of the star field fragment, he easily killed a space beast that was at level seven.<br/><br/>The next three were even easier!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian helped Lan Qingyue to kill the four space beasts.<br/><br/>In the space city, all the strong disciples of the angel and Phoenix clans had been killed.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I’ve already gotten an lie to prepare for the Divine Dragon Island. Everything has been settled! ”<br/><br/>At this moment, Prime Minister Gui flew over and spoke to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Alright. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and revealed a faint smile!<br/><br/>Wiping out so many strong people from the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan this time had already caused them serious injuries.<br/><br/>It might even alert existences above their rulers. Therefore, Wang Xian had Prime Minister Gui make full preparations.<br/><br/>Once all of their powerful disciples were exterminated, the Dragon Palace would be ready to move out of the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>Only in the nine-origin universe would there be some devil spirit altars and some dragon palaces that had been built in the past.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the Dragon Palace had also made some preparations on the Divine Dragon Island!<br/><br/>“Send an lie over. I’ll make a trip to the Divine Dragon Island before the two peak races can react! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke to Prime Minister Gui again.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King! ” Prime Minister Gui nodded.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>Soon, an Lie’s figure appeared beside Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Yes, Bring Me to the Divine Dragon Island.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded, he looked at LAN qingyue and said, “Qingyue, bring the rest of the disciples of the Dragon Palace and wait here. The Angel clan and<br/><br/>Phoenix clan shouldn’t dare to send their experts here recklessly. The other peak clans wouldn’t let them in either. ”<br/><br/>“Alright, Little Xian! ”<br/><br/>Lan qingyue nodded.<br/><br/>Wang Xian gestured to an lie and the two of them left instantly!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>The moment Wang Xian left, the entire void quickly returned to its original appearance.<br/><br/>The stars disappeared one by one.<br/><br/>“Eh? The Dragon King and the rest have left?”<br/><br/>“The next storm is just about to start. If the angel and Phoenix clans knew about this, they would probably be extremely furious! ”<br/><br/>(‘I reckon that the angel race and the Phoenix race will attack the Dragon Palace of our nine-origin universe. and the Dragon King and the others won’t let the powerful disciples of the Angel Race and the Phoenix race step into the Starry Universe! ”<br/><br/>“This time, the Dragon Palace and the Angel Race and the Phoenix race are in deep trouble. When we meet in the future, we’ll fight to the death! ”<br/><br/>In the starry city, all the experts were discussing when they saw that the void around them had recovered..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
