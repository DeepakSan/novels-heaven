They respectfully made a path for him and shouted.<br/><br/>Regardless of which peak race they were from, they were strong cultivators in the Heaven’s origin realm.<br/><br/>The strong disciples from the other races had to be respectful.<br/><br/>If they were disrespectful, they could kill them as they pleased.<br/><br/>This was the dignity of a heaven origin creator.<br/><br/>Wang Xian brought Linniu Tianci to the teleportation formation and stepped into it.<br/><br/>“HMM? The one beside the Dragon King seems to be a heaven origin creator as well. ”<br/><br/>(‘I think so. What’s going on? This heaven origin creator isn’t from our nine-origin universe, right? Did the Dragon King Find Him?”<br/><br/>“That’s possible. Now, the Phoenix Clan has an extra heaven origin creator. The number of them is almost the same as the Dragon Palace. The Dragon King has found another heaven origin creator. I’m afraid that it’s because he wants to fight against him! ”<br/><br/>“It’s an open and hidden battle! ”<br/><br/>Seeing that Wang Xian had entered the teleportation formation and was at the back, a group of powerful disciples were discussing in a low voice.<br/><br/>Phoenix Mountain.<br/><br/>This was the birthplace of the Phoenix clan and also the habitat of the Phoenix clan!<br/><br/>In Phoenix Mountain, there were many parasol trees growing.<br/><br/>These were parasol trees of the venerable level.<br/><br/>However, parasol trees of this level were everywhere.<br/><br/>There were at least a hundred thousand of them.<br/><br/>Heritage!<br/><br/>This was the heritage of the Phoenix clan!<br/><br/>The heritage of the Phoenix clan was almost as long as that of the Divine Dragon Clan!<br/><br/>In the past, the Phoenix clan had the birth of top-notch heaven origin creation stage powerhouses.<br/><br/>Under normal circumstances, once a heaven origin creation stage powerhouse died unexpectedly, the next generation of heaven origin creation stage powerhouses would be able to rejoin them immediately.<br/><br/>There wouldn’t be any fault.<br/><br/>“What an imposing manner. It’s much more imposing than Earth City. ”<br/><br/>Tianci followed beside Wang Xian. He looked around Phoenix Mountain and said in slight astonishment.<br/><br/>“The nine-origin universe as a whole is several levels higher than your six<br/><br/>paths universe.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to him.<br/><br/>Just a fallen Shadow Devil Emperor could destroy the entire six paths universe.<br/><br/>The strongest undead in the six paths universe was only at the level of the 12 ancestral warlocks.<br/><br/>Tianci nodded his head!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, this way please! ”<br/><br/>At this moment, a fire phoenix flapped its wings and led the way to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head lightly and flew straight ahead!<br/><br/>Soon, a huge banquet platform appeared in his sight.<br/><br/>There was an extremely powerful formation brewing in the surrounding areas!<br/><br/>In the middle, there were more than 20 seats!<br/><br/>There were already people sitting on the seats.<br/><br/>The Emperor of angels, the ancestor of Xuanwu, the Hetian saint, the Emperor of Phoenix, the twelve ancestral warlocks, and the rest were all sitting there!<br/><br/>The seat in the middle was still empty. It was obvious that it was reserved for the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor.<br/><br/>In the nine-origin universe, the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor was the strongest and had the highest status.<br/><br/>“Hehe, the Dragon King Is Here!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian arrived, the emperor of Phoenix saw him and sneered. He said to him, “I heard that you invested in the floating queen of the celestial nation and used up a lot of resources. What a pity.”<br/><br/>“Indeed, it’s a pity. The floating queen has already reached the threshold of the shackles. You guys beat her to it. It’s really bad luck!” Wang Xian came to a seat and sat down. He replied calmly.<br/><br/>Lin Niu and Tianci were sitting beside him!<br/><br/>“Hehe, our Phoenix clan has always had good luck. ”<br/><br/>The Emperor of Phoenix smiled and glanced at tianci. He raised his eyebrows slightly. “Why are there outsiders in the Golden Age of our nine-origin universe?”<br/><br/>After the Emperor of Phoenix finished speaking, the eyes of the Emperor of angels, the Hetian saint, and the rest also landed on tianci.<br/><br/>Today was the golden age of the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>Tianci was obviously an expert from another universe.<br/><br/>However, when they sized up Tianci’s face, they had a thought!<br/><br/>“There are no outsiders. Let me introduce you to my foster son, Mu Litianci.<br/><br/>He is from the six paths universe. He has just broken through.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the Emperor of Phoenix with a smile on his face. He introduced, “He is stronger than you. You should know that! ” “After all, he’s not a powerhouse from our nine-origin universe! ”<br/><br/>The emperor of Phoenix’s face darkened. He remained silent for a few seconds before he said expressionlessly.<br/><br/>The powerhouses of Tianyuan in the nine-origin universe knew about Tianci and the six paths universe.<br/><br/>Naturally, they knew that Tianci had a complete treasure of Tianyuan in his body.<br/><br/>Now that he had made a breakthrough, he had a strength that was not weaker than that of a controller.<br/><br/>The reason why the King of Water Phoenix was able to make a breakthrough this time was that the king of Water Phoenix had taken out many treasures of the Phoenix clan.<br/><br/>Some resources and treasures that would not be used unless it was an emergency.<br/><br/>He had to take them out.<br/><br/>In order to fight against the Dragon Palace and the Wang Immortal.<br/><br/>Especially after what happened in the six paths universe.<br/><br/>The Dragon King had an adopted son who was at the control level. Although it was said that he belonged to another universe, he could not pose a threat to him now.<br/><br/>But what about after the Apocalypse?<br/><br/>Therefore, the emperor of the Phoenix spared no expense and allowed the king of the Water Phoenix to achieve a breakthrough.<br/><br/>He stopped the breakthrough of the Queen of the Water Phoenix!<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled faintly when he heard his words. He didn’t say anything and looked around.<br/><br/>At this moment, the powerful disciples from the various peak races and the nine-origin universe had already rushed over from their surroundings.<br/><br/>The entire area around the banquet hall was densely packed with the powerful disciples from the various races.<br/><br/>With a glance, there were at least a billion of them!<br/><br/>It was endless!<br/><br/>It looked extremely spectacular!<br/><br/>All the powerful disciples were discussing and talking excitedly.<br/><br/>Many powerful disciples had never seen the scene of a Heavenly Yuan creation realm expert breaking through in their entire lives.<br/><br/>They wanted to see it for themselves and hoped that one day, they would be able to reach this stage.<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui and the powerful disciples of the Dragon Palace were also watching from not far away.<br/><br/>Most of the disciples of the Dragon Palace had also arrived.<br/><br/>The breakthrough of a Heavenly Yuan creation realm expert might be able to give them some insights.<br/><br/>seconds and minutes passed.<br/><br/>Not long after, the Shadow Devil Emperor appeared out of thin air on his seat!<br/><br/>The Emperor of the Phoenix, Queen of the elves, and Wang Xian sensed something and immediately cupped their hands at him.<br/><br/>The Shadow Devil Emperor nodded at them.<br/><br/>When he saw Wang Xian, he was slightly stunned. A hint of doubt flashed across his eyes!<br/><br/>Then, he saw Tianci and nodded at him as well.<br/><br/>“Foster father, is this person at the level of the Great Dao? When he arrived just now, I actually didn’t sense it.”<br/><br/>Tianci saw the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor and asked Wang Xian telepathically.<br/><br/>Wang Xian replied.<br/><br/>When the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor arrived just now, Tianci didn’t sense it.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian sensed it.<br/><br/>He could even sense it from afar.<br/><br/>Currently, the body of the Void Divine Dragon was in his body. The Tai Chi Dragon Disc and the Five Elements Millstone were also in his body.<br/><br/>With all sorts of buffs, he possessed strength that was not weaker than the Great Dao.<br/><br/>Naturally, he could sense the fallen shadow demon emperor..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
