Although there were few branches, each branch was lush and full of vitality.<br/><br/>The ancestral tree extended a branch and the Black Spider Lily landed on it. It slowly gave off vitality.<br/><br/>Buzz Buzz Buzz<br/><br/>When the Black Spider Lily gave off vitality again, a depraved, evil, and filthy sound came from within.<br/><br/>This sound was abnormally evil, disgusting, and uncomfortable.<br/><br/>In fact, if a weakling heard it, he would go crazy.<br/><br/>This was because the black resurrection Lily belonged to Wang Xian and the Dragon Palace. This voice had no effect on Wang Xian, nor did it affect the members of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>However, they could still sense this evil voice.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, this voice sounds very uncomfortable. Legend has it that the angel race has similar resurrection Lily. However, the resurrection Lily can make use of the energy of the Resurrection Lily to inspire and inspire people, allowing them to unleash even more powerful combat strength.”<br/><br/>“That Resurrection Lily is a treasure of the angel race. This black resurrection Lily should not be simple either.”<br/><br/>Lei Ming had obviously heard of this resurrection Lily before and said.<br/><br/>“It is very strange. Even us poisonous horned dragons feel uncomfortable hearing it.”<br/><br/>The eight-limbed demon demon nodded in agreement.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, can I borrow this resurrection Lily?”<br/><br/>The current leader of the Dolphin clan asked.<br/><br/>This was also the only member of the Dolphin clan who had advanced to the level of a universe knight in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Currently, he was the only non-combat member of the Dragon Palace. He was also the most ordinary dragon in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Sure.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not reject her and nodded his head.<br/><br/>She moved and immediately flew to the front of the ancestral tree. She reached out and took the black resurrection Lily in her hand.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s mind moved. He controlled the resurrection Lily and the ancestral tree to not resist.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>She took the resurrection Lily in her hand and closed her eyes slightly. Then, she uttered a sound.<br/><br/>The sound came from the Resurrection Lily. A terrifying sound swept over.<br/><br/>“Uncle Lei Ming, I’m using the power of the Resurrection Lily to attack you. Pay attention.”<br/><br/>The dolphin leader looked at Lei Ming and said.<br/><br/>“Alright, Bring It On.”<br/><br/>Lei Ming nodded his head.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest looked over from the side.<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>The dolphin leader opened her mouth and black musical notes flew out from her body. The black musical notes slowly turned into black spider lilies and disappeared into the air.<br/><br/>Following that, a sound wave rushed towards Lei Ming.<br/><br/>This made Thunder’s arm tighten and a trace of blood red flashed in his eyes.<br/><br/>“This sound will make me feel hot and angry. It will affect my judgment and actions.”<br/><br/>“I estimate that when universe knights level 2 or below hear this terrifying sound, their combat power will drop drastically. The weaker ones will collapse and go crazy.”<br/><br/>“A very terrifying power that can affect the mind.”<br/><br/>Lei Ming said slowly.<br/><br/>The dolphin leader opened his eyes, and his voice stopped abruptly. His eyes gleamed. “It is very powerful!”<br/><br/>“So, this resurrection Lily is a very terrifying weapon for the Dolphin Race?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said with a smile.<br/><br/>“Yes, it’s a pity that this resurrection Lily is too rare.”<br/><br/>The leader of the Dolphins said.<br/><br/>Using this resurrection Lily, he was able to influence the Thunder. One could imagine how powerful this black resurrection Lily was.<br/><br/>Of course, this was also because she was good at sound waves.<br/><br/>“The ancestral tree can allow this resurrection Lily to continue to grow and reproduce. Perhaps in a short while, more black resurrection Lily will grow on the ancestral tree.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said as he looked at the various treasures at the side.<br/><br/>Other than the black resurrection Lily, there were no other mystical items.<br/><br/>“How many resources do we have this time?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at Prime Minister Gui.<br/><br/>“We have obtained 23 universe knight level corpses. Eight of them are at the second level of the universe knight level. Even the universe God Nation of the Skeleton Race’s knight has obtained them.”<br/><br/>“The remaining two million god Emperor level corpses, especially the skeleton race, have all been exterminated. There are tens of billions of god King level corpses.”<br/><br/>“Furthermore, the Skeleton Race’s God country is on the Skeleton Island. This time, the devouring dragon will be able to obtain a considerable improvement.”<br/><br/>“There are many kinds of God weapons and treasures. There are four to five that can fight against universe knights. Currently, they have not been completely cleaned up.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui said with a smile.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was satisfied. This time, the Dragon Palace had obtained the most treasures in history.<br/><br/>He didn’t know how much the Dragon Palace could improve.<br/><br/>“Let’s celebrate and let all the members improve their strength. Although we won this battle, we still have the ancient art sect as a potential enemy.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui and the rest nodded.<br/><br/>In the next two days, the Dragon Palace celebrated the victory of this war and cleaned up the gains from this war.<br/><br/>Two days later, all the members began to increase their resources.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was in the Dragon King’s palace. At this moment, he had transformed into the body of a divine dragon and was lying beside the dragon bone.<br/><br/>He wanted to absorb the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>The dragon bone turned into dragon blood and entered Wang Xian’s body rapidly.<br/><br/>As it was a pure divine dragon bone, the transformation speed of the dragon energy was extremely fast.<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed the tremendous energy and revealed an extremely excited expression.<br/><br/>His eyes were glowing as he absorbed the energy rapidly.<br/><br/>The dragon energy in his body was increasing at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>Crack Crack Crack<br/><br/>A day later, Wang Xian’s dragon body began to change. Waves of even more majestic power were emitted from his body.<br/><br/>On his body, the rich eight-colored light carried traces of lightning power. It looked extremely mystical from afar.<br/><br/>The eight-colored light slowly condensed into the shadows of the Divine Dragons.<br/><br/>The Shadows of the Divine Dragons were very small and were only the size of dragon scales. Each divine dragon was floating above one of the dragon scales, densely packed.<br/><br/>“Ding, congratulations to host for breaking through to the void God Emperor Level 7.”<br/><br/>“Ding, Congratulations to host for comprehending the laws and divine ability: Dragon Tomb.”<br/><br/>Name: Wang Xian<br/><br/>Race: Yin-yang Five Elements Divine Dragon (man-dragon unity)<br/><br/>Level: void God Emperor Level 7(Divine Dragon Transformation Level 8)<br/><br/>Origin: 1% (99% needed for the next breakthrough)<br/><br/>Divine ability: ruling the water tribe (ruling the water tribe below their level)<br/><br/>Devour living beings (devour living beings to extract origin)<br/><br/>Control of the five elements<br/><br/>Cultivation Method: Divine Dragon Transformation<br/><br/>Divine ability: soul-absorbing, spirit-attaching<br/><br/>Laws and divine abilities: Dragon Eye Lock, Five Elements Dragon Claw, Yin-yang realm-breaking, eight luminaries dragon scale, Sacred Dragon Shadow, subduing Dragon, Dragon Tomb<br/><br/>Aspect: five elements grinding, Dragon Kingdom in the palm, Dragon head under the heavens, Dragon body of ten thousand miles, yin-yang Poles, Yin-yang five elements alms bowl, Divine Dragon Tail Swing!<br/><br/>Control Law: metal, wood, water, fire, Earth, light, dark wind<br/><br/>Divine Kingdom: Dragon Palace<br/><br/>Dragon Palace owned: Day After Tomorrow.<br/><br/>Member of Dragon Palace: 1134450<br/><br/>The system’s voice sounded.
