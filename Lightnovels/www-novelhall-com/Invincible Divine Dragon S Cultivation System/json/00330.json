At this moment, Mo Sha’s figure appeared in Blackwing city.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at Mo Sha and smiled.<br/><br/>“Let’s Move!”<br/><br/>He said faintly.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Mo Sha nodded his head. His body moved and he immediately entered Blackwing city.<br/><br/>In half a month’s time, Mo Sha had completed his breakthrough. All he needed to do now was to wait here quietly!<br/><br/>Time passed once again and everything became calm.<br/><br/>Mo Sha and Ba Qi sneaked into the black wing grotto-heaven.<br/><br/>The two of them were parasitic on the strong lich, so they could easily enter.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian could not enter. Once he entered, he would arouse vigilance.<br/><br/>This was also the reason why he could not join hands with them to deal with the thousand-eyed city lord.<br/><br/>Another half a month passed. Ba Qi and Mo Sha were looking for an opportunity until half a month later.<br/><br/>In an extremely luxurious small palace in the highest sky of the black wing grotto-heaven, a blood-red lich with densely packed pupils on his arms, face, chest, and even legs stood in the middle, a smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>Beside him lay a lich. This Lich’s body was trembling violently, with only a faint life force remaining.<br/><br/>“Keke, it’s really hard to deal with. It took us half a month to finish it. If it weren’t for the Dragon King obtaining the poison from Scorpion Emperor City, we might not have succeeded this time.”<br/><br/>“Ba Qi, let’s go, let’s Go get the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>At the side, another lich laughed loudly and said.<br/><br/>The two figures moved and walked out.<br/><br/>“Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Ten minutes later, the two liches stood respectfully in front of Wang Xian and bowed.<br/><br/>“Very good. How is the information now?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them and asked with a smile.<br/><br/>“We have all the information. Currently, every level 8 universe Knight Lich in the Lich Kingdom has a few secret teleportation arrays. The other liches don’t know about this teleportation array.”<br/><br/>“If we attack recklessly, the Lich Kingdom will be able to gather seven level 8 universe knights in five seconds to come and support us.”<br/><br/>Ba Qi, who was parasitizing the thousand-eyed city lord, reported.<br/><br/>“Oh? Let’s not worry about anything else. We are prepared to take action and destroy Blackwing City first!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian instructed.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King. However, before we destroy it, we can get all the resources in Blackwing City.”<br/><br/>Ba Qi said with a smile.<br/><br/>“How long will it take?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them and asked with a smile.<br/><br/>“One day. One day later, we’ll look for you, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Ba Qi said.<br/><br/>“Alright, we’ll Take Action One day later!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and watched the two of them leave.<br/><br/>After the two of them left, they were ready to take action immediately.<br/><br/>As the city lord of Blackwing City, the thousand-eyed city Lord had great authority.<br/><br/>It wasn’t difficult for him to get his hands on some treasures and resources.<br/><br/>A Day passed quickly. On the second day, Thousand Eye City Leader gave a notification.<br/><br/>In the entire black wing city, over 10,000 universe knight level warriors all came to black wing grotto-heaven.<br/><br/>“Why did the city leader call us here?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know, it’s probably related to the Dragon Palace. It’s all because of that Damn Dragon Palace Dragon King, he’s making everyone in the Lich Kingdom nervous!”<br/><br/>“If we can break through the Dragon Palace, I’ll transfer the Dragon God’s head and body to my own body!”<br/><br/>“Don’t even think about it, we only got the head of a demon dragon, I heard that it’s very powerful!”<br/><br/>Over 10,000 universe knight level liches from Black Wing City were gathered together, they didn’t have too many doubts.<br/><br/>Naturally, they wouldn’t have any doubts when the city leader summoned them.<br/><br/>Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong<br/><br/>However, at this moment, waves of terrifying energy came from above them.<br/><br/>This made the liches from black wing city slightly shocked, and their faces were filled with shock and horror.<br/><br/>“What’s going on? What Happened?”<br/><br/>Feeling the threat of death and the arrival of death, the liches roared in fear.<br/><br/>What on Earth had happened?<br/><br/>Why was there such a terrifying energy enveloping them all of a sudden?<br/><br/>Hong<br/><br/>However, before they could react, the gray energy in the sky swept downwards.<br/><br/>At the same time, an extremely terrifying five elements millstone descended.<br/><br/>Everything happened in an instant.<br/><br/>“Oh no, run, run, run!”<br/><br/>“There’s an ambush, run!”<br/><br/>Those universe knights at level seven could still resist for a while.<br/><br/>“You want to run?”<br/><br/>“Die!”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian’s figure slowly appeared at the side. With a wave of his arm, chains attacked.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>“What’s going on? Where’s our castellan? Where’s our castellan!”<br/><br/>A desperate voice came out from their mouths. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>However, very soon, all the exclamations disappeared.<br/><br/>“You guys pack up. I’ll go destroy the city!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to them. His figure moved and flew out of the black wing grotto-heaven.<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>In the depths of the black wing grotto-heaven, the eight-limbed demon fiend and the rest walked out.<br/><br/>In order to prevent any accidents, they did not show up just now.<br/><br/>Everything that followed was much simpler.<br/><br/>When a divine dragon floated in the sky above black wing city, all the liches’faces were filled with fear.<br/><br/>Then why did the Dragon King appear?<br/><br/>Where was their black wing city’s city Lord and the other lords?<br/><br/>The destruction of the city began!<br/><br/>Black wing city was very big, but with the five elements grinding, his attack speed was still very fast.<br/><br/>Streams of gray energy swept out and covered a radius of hundreds of millions of kilometers.<br/><br/>Within a radius of hundreds of millions of kilometers, all the liches were killed instantly.<br/><br/>A mouthful of dragon flame spewed out and a radius of tens of millions of kilometers turned into a sea of fire. It was like a land of lava.<br/><br/>Blackwing city was destroyed at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>This attack was much easier than the previous attacks by Wang Xian.<br/><br/>In blackwing city, countless liches let out miserable screams and fled in all directions.<br/><br/>However, there weren’t many people who could escape.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian started to wreak havoc in Blackwing city, the news from this side was quickly transmitted to the lich king.<br/><br/>“How is this possible? How is this possible!”<br/><br/>This time, even the lich king was filled with disbelief.<br/><br/>The Lich King panicked!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
