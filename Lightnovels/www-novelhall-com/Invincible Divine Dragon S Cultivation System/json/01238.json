Thank you, Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor! ”<br/><br/>Jiuli half-knelt and thanked Wang Xian and the rest.<br/><br/>“Hehe, there’s no need. Get Up!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and waved his hand.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. We’re going back! ”<br/><br/>Shadow Devil Emperor smiled in satisfaction and said to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and the three of them flew out.<br/><br/>At the back, the three Heaven’s origin creation powerhouses could only watch quietly.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest were rushing to the nine origin universe. He did not order an lie to come and pick them up.<br/><br/>On the way back, Wang Xian also wanted to learn some things from the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor.<br/><br/>As a veteran heaven origin creator powerhouse, a powerhouse at the level of the Great Dao.<br/><br/>The Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor knew much more than Wang Xian.<br/><br/>During the journey, Wang Xian also asked a lot of questions.<br/><br/>Although he wasted another 10,000 to 20,000 years flying all the way here, he still benefited a lot from it.<br/><br/>However, not long after Wang Xian returned to the nine-origin universe, the experts from the Divine Tiger Clan suddenly came looking for him.<br/><br/>This made Wang Xian look surprised.<br/><br/>“Divine Tiger clan’s Huming Mountain, your disciple greets the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was in the main hall of the Dragon Palace. The experts from the Divine Tiger Clan, Huming Mountain, rushed over and greeted him respectfully!<br/><br/>Stand up. What are you here for? Have you found a universe that can help you achieve a breakthrough?”<br/><br/>He looked at Huming Mountain and asked!<br/><br/>This time, Wang Xian was the Dao Protector of the nine-origin universe. As long as a group of disciples had found a universe that could help them achieve a breakthrough, they could come to Wang Yun for Dao Protection!<br/><br/>Huming mountain was a disciple that could achieve a breakthrough.<br/><br/>“Yes, Lord Dragon King. I have found a universe that can help me achieve a breakthrough. Please help me, Lord Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Huming Shan knelt down and begged.<br/><br/>“Get up. It has already been agreed. If you find a universe that can be broken through, I will definitely do my best to protect your path and strengthen the nine-origin universe. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and a force supported it.<br/><br/>He was also a little surprised.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was not surprised that Jiuli could break through so quickly. After all, the one behind him was the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor.<br/><br/>An expert at the level of Great Dao was using his doppelganger to search for a universe where he could achieve a breakthrough.<br/><br/>The Divine Tiger clan did not have an expert at the level of Heaven’s origin creation behind them. Yet, they were able to find the universe so quickly.<br/><br/>This was even faster than the saint’s lineage.<br/><br/>“Thank you, Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>Huming Shan stood up in excitement.<br/><br/>“Tell me about the strength of that universe. You also know what it means for you to achieve a breakthrough in their universe.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke to him.<br/><br/>Sir Dragon King, I have already inquired about it. There are four powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin creation realm in that universe. All of them have yet to reach the control level! ”<br/><br/>Huming mountain immediately reported!<br/><br/>“Four? If all of them have yet to reach the control level, then it shouldn’t be a big problem! ”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard that, he nodded his head slightly.<br/><br/>If all of them had yet to reach the control level, the strongest among the four powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin creation realm could only be compared to eight existences who had just stepped into the Heaven’s origin creation realm.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s current strength was comparable to nine of them.<br/><br/>Therefore, the problem was not too big!<br/><br/>Moreover, it was impossible for all of them to be veteran Heaven’s origin powerhouses.<br/><br/>“I can set off at any time. You just need to arrange a time for me.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued to speak to huming mountain!<br/><br/>” Dragon King, 1 can set off at any time too!<br/><br/>Huming mountain also spoke with slight excitement!<br/><br/>“Alright, let’s go now. How far is it?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood up and said to him.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I don’t know the distance either. I accidentally obtained a treasure when I went out this time. It’s a fixed-point teleportation treasure. Through this treasure, I can directly reach that universe! ”<br/><br/>“Moreover, through this treasure, I can return immediately. I still have six uses for that treasure now!”<br/><br/>Huming Mountain said!<br/><br/>This made Wang Xian raise his eyebrows slightly.<br/><br/>“Oh? You mean, we can enter that universe immediately?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked.<br/><br/>“Yes, Sir Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>Huming mountain nodded.<br/><br/>“Alright, let’s Go! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded slightly and said to him directly.<br/><br/>Huming Mountain moved his palm and a treasure that was like a cauldron appeared in front of him.<br/><br/>The cauldron grew bigger, and there was a whirlpool inside.<br/><br/>Hu Ming Shan injected energy directly into it, and the whirlpool slowly revealed the appearance of another world!<br/><br/>“Lord Dragon King, we can just jump in directly!”<br/><br/>Hu Ming Shan said, his heart full of excitement and anticipation.<br/><br/>This time, he was lucky. When he went out to search for the universe for millions of years, he killed a group of experts from other universes.<br/><br/>He obtained this special treasure from the powerhouses of that universe.<br/><br/>After he entered that universe, he sensed that there was a quota for a breakthrough in this universe.<br/><br/>In this universe, he had lurked for tens of thousands of years and understood everything about this universe.<br/><br/>First of all, this universe was called the mountain universe.<br/><br/>According to his long-term investigation, he learned that there were four heaven origin creation powerhouses in this universe.<br/><br/>Four powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin realm.<br/><br/>If he were to make a breakthrough in this universe, there was a 100% chance that he would be killed.<br/><br/>Therefore, he came back immediately and begged the Dragon King to protect him!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the scene of the other world in the vortex and nodded There was no danger.<br/><br/>Naturally, huming mountain did not dare to harm him.<br/><br/>Furthermore, he could sense if huming mountain was lying in front of Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew into the cauldron while huming mountain followed closely behind.<br/><br/>Buzz Buzz<br/><br/>In the next moment, Wang Xian sensed the changes in the surroundings and arrived in another universe.<br/><br/>He could sense that the aura of this universe was completely different from that of the nine-origin universe!<br/><br/>The mountain universe was a universe with average strength.<br/><br/>The figure of huming mountain appeared beside Wang Xian, he scanned his surroundings and said, “Sir Dragon King, we are now at the periphery of the mountain universe. This universe is very unique. There are no planets and there are mountains floating in the void. ”<br/><br/>“The living beings here also live on these mountains. They are located at the center and there is an endless mountain range. That is the center of the<br/><br/>Mountain Universe.”<br/><br/>Humming Tiger Mountain reported the news he had received..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
