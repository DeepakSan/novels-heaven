In less than 10,000 years, he had made two consecutive breakthroughs.<br/><br/>Under his telepathic perception, Wang Xian looked at his attributes and smiled.<br/><br/>“My current strength is already very terrifying. However, the improvement is not over yet. Everything is not over yet! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly.<br/><br/>He still had the book of water forbidden spell that he had yet to finish refining. There was also the Heaven’s origin jade horn that he had yet to finish refining.<br/><br/>Of course, the Heaven’s origin jade horn could not increase his combat strength, but the book of water forbidden spell could increase it by a lot!<br/><br/>This was a fragment of the Heaven’s origin destiny!<br/><br/>“Continue! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. He did not stop and continued to refine the jade horn!<br/><br/>First, he would refine the Heaven’s origin jade horn. In case of any special circumstances, he would be able to take action immediately.<br/><br/>The Heaven’s origin Jade Horn was what the Divine Dragon Clan used to call this treasure.<br/><br/>As for the existence of this jade horn, Wang Xian had no idea.<br/><br/>The improvement in his realm allowed him to improve his refining speed significantly.<br/><br/>With the help of the Five Elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, it was very fast to refine it.<br/><br/>However, even though it was very fast, it still took him nearly ten thousand years to completely refine it.<br/><br/>After refining the Heaven’s origin jade horn, he fused it into Wang Xian’s dragon horn and hid it completely.<br/><br/>“An lie, bring me to the starry universe! ”<br/><br/>After the refinement was completed, Wang Xian called an lie over and instructed him.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>An lie nodded. In the next second, he appeared at the edge of the boundless starry universe, at the land of lightning.<br/><br/>When he arrived here, he immediately felt that the suppression from before had completely disappeared.<br/><br/>It was as if there was no difference between him entering the starry universe and the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>He was a living being in the starry universe.<br/><br/>This universe completely acknowledged his existence!<br/><br/>This made Wang Xian’s eyes burst with excitement.<br/><br/>“With my strength, I can step into the depths of the Infinite Starry Universe! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked in the direction of the depths of the infinite starry universe and said with slight excitement.<br/><br/>The current him was able to kill a space beast at the peak of the Dominator realm even though he had the fragment of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Other than a few space beasts at the peak of the Dominator realm who had huge treasures and opportunities, there was no one below the Heaven’s origin realm that could match him!<br/><br/>“Let’s go back!”<br/><br/>After feeling it for a while, Wang Xian returned to the Dragon Palace once again!<br/><br/>Next, he continued to refine the book of Water Forbidden Spell!<br/><br/>The Book of Water Forbidden Spell was a part of a book of Heaven’s origin creation. This part should take up one-third to one-fourth of the book.<br/><br/>Therefore, according to the level, the destructive power of the book of water forbidden spell was slightly stronger than the fragments of the Starfield.<br/><br/>The eight fragments that were fused together in Wang Xian’s hands were only one-fifth of the entire Heaven’s origin creation treasure!<br/><br/>Therefore, it took Wang Xian more than ten thousand years to refine the book of water curse!<br/><br/>“Hualala!”<br/><br/>After the book of water curse was refined, a slightly worn-out book floated in front of Wang Xian.<br/><br/>The book emitted a simple blue light that contained endless power!<br/><br/>The pages on the book flipped and produced a Hualala Sound.<br/><br/>Each page contained an extremely terrifying book of forbidden spells!<br/><br/>Water Forbidden Spell!<br/><br/>Each page contained a water forbidden spell, and there were more than thirty pages.<br/><br/>Of course, with the current energy in Wang Xian’s body, it was still insufficient for him to use all the forbidden spells on it.<br/><br/>As for the power of the forbidden spell, it was a little terrifying.<br/><br/>Each attack was comparable to a full-strength attack from a powerhouse at the peak of the ruler realm.<br/><br/>In fact, the last few pages were a combination of forbidden spells.<br/><br/>This combination of forbidden spells was even more terrifying. However, this was not something that Wang Xian could cast.<br/><br/>Now, he could cast more than twenty pages of forbidden spells.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian soon discovered a problem.<br/><br/>That was, his strength was not enough to control two fragments of the Heaven’s origin creation.<br/><br/>Wang Xian could not even fully cast a single star field fragment, let alone the attack from the book of water forbidden spells.<br/><br/>This was because he didn’t have so much energy in his body.<br/><br/>It was already difficult to activate one, let alone the second one.<br/><br/>“In this case, refining the book of water forbidden spell won’t be able to increase my strength too much. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed for a moment and frowned slightly.<br/><br/>For example, without the book of water forbidden spell, he could destroy ten powerhouses at the peak of the ruler realm.<br/><br/>With the book of water forbidden spell, he could only kill eleven, twelve, or no more.<br/><br/>It was because he didn’t have enough energy.<br/><br/>Therefore, there was a limit to how much the book of water forbidden spell could improve Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“It seems like any energy can be used to activate the star field fragment. However, the book of water forbidden spell is different. Only water-elemental masters can control it. Currently, the Dragon Palace doesn’t have any strong water-elemental masters. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled to himself and decided to use it himself.<br/><br/>Although it was said that the improvement was limited to him, it was still limited to him. Compared to a fragment of Heaven’s fate, it was still limited to an ordinary powerhouse.<br/><br/>In fact, this improvement was still very impressive.<br/><br/>At the very least, there were more methods and methods of attack.<br/><br/>For example, the book of water forbidden spell contained a water element forbidden spell. This forbidden spell could block the enemy’s vision and perception.<br/><br/>This blocking and perception was extremely terrifying.<br/><br/>The effect of being caught off guard would be huge.<br/><br/>“I’ll use it myself first. I’ll talk about the rest later.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian made a decision in his heart. He looked at the book in his hand, a smile appeared on his face. “If nothing goes wrong, this book of water forbidden spells comes from the Heaven’s origin creation treasure in the sword and Magic Universe. For some reason, it was divided into several parts!”<br/><br/>“Now, we can explore the starry universe. We can easily occupy some dangerous places. The Dragon Palace doesn’t lack core fighters, but it lacks peak fighters.. I wonder how strong the Dragon Palace has become over the\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
