A force that far exceeded that of the chaos realm spread out in all directions.<br/><br/>The surrounding chaotic void was dyed red with a scorching temperature.<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled when he saw this scene.<br/><br/>“Thank You, Your Majesty Dragon King, for helping me to improve and achieve a breakthrough.”<br/><br/>The Divine Roc of the nine heavens knelt in front of Wang Xian and said with gratitude.<br/><br/>Without Wang Xian, he would be dead.<br/><br/>Without Wang Xian, it was impossible for him to achieve a breakthrough.<br/><br/>“It’s good that you can achieve a breakthrough. Show me your strength.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled at him.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The Divine Roc of the Nine Heavens replied immediately. He flapped his wings excitedly.<br/><br/>Rumble<br/><br/>Following that, terrifying flaming boulders that looked like meteorites shot out from his wings.<br/><br/>These meteorites were extremely huge and blotted out the Sun. Each of them was comparable to a life planet.<br/><br/>Countless meteorites covered the area in front of them.<br/><br/>They were exuding an extremely terrifying power.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I feel that my strength has increased by at least two to three times compared to before.”<br/><br/>The Divine Roc of the Nine Heavens said excitedly.<br/><br/>“Yes, that’s fine.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded. The current Divine Roc of the Nine Heavens could easily destroy an entire universe.<br/><br/>His strength was much weaker than the leader of the Universal Alliance. Of course, it was mainly because the leader of the Universal Alliance had made a breakthrough for a very, very long time.<br/><br/>“Your Majesty, although I have made a breakthrough, I still feel that there is a huge gap between us. Dragon King, What Realm are you at now? Do you need to be higher?”<br/><br/>The Divine Roc of the Nine Heavens looked at Wang Xian and couldn’t help but ask curiously.<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head. “The realm you are at now should be the highest realm. There is no upper limit to this realm. You can continue to improve by absorbing the energy of the fire attribute.”<br/><br/>“I feel that it is very difficult for me to improve now. Unless I have a large number of treasures of the fire attribute, the speed will be very slow. Of course, this is only relative. Compared to the past, it is already ridiculously fast.”<br/><br/>The Divine Roc of the Nine Heavens said with a smile.<br/><br/>“You should stabilize your strength. You Don’t need to be in a hurry for the rest of your cultivation. You can just improve slowly.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to him.<br/><br/>After saying that, he moved his body and returned to the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The improvement of the Divine Roc of the Nine Heavens had improved the strength of the Dragon Palace considerably. In the future, when Wang Xian traveled in the chaos, he could also take charge of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Of course, for now, it didn’t matter if there were any powerhouses in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>In this area, no force dared to provoke the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Prime Minister Gui.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian returned to the Dragon Palace. With a thought, he called Prime Minister Gui over.<br/><br/>“Your Majesty, I’m here.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui rushed over immediately.<br/><br/>“Tell me about the current situation of the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at him and asked.<br/><br/>“Reporting to Dragon King.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui nodded. “Over the past ten million years, the number of powerhouses at the heaven origin creation level in our Dragon Palace has already reached 500. It is still increasing at a terrifying rate.”<br/><br/>“Is it 500? It’s still alright. Let the disciples cultivate well.”<br/><br/>He nodded without any fluctuation.<br/><br/>This number seemed to be a lot in one universe.<br/><br/>However, after witnessing the brilliance of the Universal Alliance, he wasn’t too surprised.<br/><br/>There were more than 10,000 powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin realm in the entire Universal Alliance.<br/><br/>Currently, the disciples of the Dragon Palace didn’t have the ability to travel in the chaos for a long time.<br/><br/>They had to be careful when entering another region.<br/><br/>“Where are the Dragon Queen and the rest?”Wang Xian sensed the dragon palace and continued to ask Prime Minister Gui.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, the Dragon Queen is worried about the situation of the crown prince and the princesses. They have all gone to the torrent area.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui replied.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head. With a move of his body, he disappeared as well.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>The next second, he arrived at the torrent area.<br/><br/>The torrent area was where the little ones were currently training.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, more than ten million years had passed, and the little ones had grown up a lot.<br/><br/>He had left a devil spirit altar at the edge of the torrent area, so he could come here directly.<br/><br/>After divining the location of the girls, he quickly flew over.<br/><br/>The torrent area, the location in front of the torrent area.<br/><br/>This was a special area of the torrent area, and it was also the most prosperous area of the torrent area.<br/><br/>There were three large factions in the torrent area, and it wasn’t very peaceful between these three large factions. They were always fighting openly and secretly.<br/><br/>But overall, this area was relatively peaceful.<br/><br/>One of the most important reasons was that the torrent area was already connected to a place called the eight directions region.<br/><br/>The eight directions region was relatively powerful, and the entire eight directions region was controlled by a large faction. That large faction had several thousand heavenly Yuan creation realm experts.<br/><br/>Although there were three major forces in the torrent region, there were only a few hundred heaven origin destiny realm powerhouses in each major force.<br/><br/>Wang Xian came to the front of the special domain of the torrent region and looked ahead.<br/><br/>In front of him, there was an incomparably huge tumultuous river.<br/><br/>This was a river of chaos. The water element energy was the main element in it. It flowed through a long region in the chaos.<br/><br/>Within this river of primal chaos, there were special creatures living. Similarly, there was a primal chaos true treasure here that had yet to be obtained by any force.<br/><br/>The three great forces of the Torrent region all had holy lands and blessed lands around this river of primal chaos.<br/><br/>The main reason was that this river of primal chaos flowed through a vast region, and it was very close to more than ten universes.<br/><br/>This also caused many factions to open up cultivation holy lands around the river of primal chaos.<br/><br/>Because of the river of primal chaos, a large number of experts were born in these ten universes.<br/><br/>The three major factions were also born from these ten universes.<br/><br/>Guan Shuqing and the girls were located in a faction’s holy land.<br/><br/>This holy land was called the Flowing Wood Holy Land, and it was created by one of the three major factions, the flowing wood universe.<br/><br/>The Holy Land was close to the river of chaos. There were a large number of strong disciples here.<br/><br/>As the river of chaos was relatively stable, this also resulted in more than a billion living beings cultivating in this holy land.<br/><br/>It also resulted in this place being unusually prosperous.<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed the location of Guan Shuqing and the rest. With a thought, he came to a huge pagoda.<br/><br/>The pagoda was called the river viewing pagoda. It was exceptionally magnificent and its height had reached an unimaginable level.<br/><br/>More than ten girls were sitting in a room, eating the delicacies here and discussing things.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>“Hehe, how is it?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian teleported to their room and asked with a smile.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
