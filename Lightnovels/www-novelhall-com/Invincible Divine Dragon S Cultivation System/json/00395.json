The disciples of the scattered Dragon Palace had a breakthrough in the five elements<br/><br/>“Hehe, alright. Since it’s useful to you, you can take it!”<br/><br/>When the second supreme elder heard Wang Xian’s words, a smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>It was enough to repay him tenfold!<br/><br/>Since the Thunder Ray tribe had taken out such a treasure, it was a bet on Wang Xian’s future.<br/><br/>“Get out. Now that you have become the eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray Tribe, your status is equivalent to that of an elder. You can go to most places of the Thunder Ray tribe and have considerable authority. I’ll let the first elder inform you about this later!”<br/><br/>“Also, under normal circumstances, every birth of the eldest senior brother will be held at a celebration banquet. You can set a time for this celebration banquet. There is no rush. It will be within ten years.”<br/><br/>The second supreme elder said to Wang Xian with a smile.<br/><br/>He was very satisfied with Wang Xian.<br/><br/>The only regret was that he was not a disciple of the lightning race.<br/><br/>However, thinking about it, the lightning race could not give birth to such a talented disciple.<br/><br/>“Alright, Second Supreme Elder!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head and held the fire dragon bead in his hand.<br/><br/>After exiting the treasure vault of the Lightning race, Wang Xian separated from the second Supreme Elder and flew towards his own palace.<br/><br/>The second supreme elder looked at his figure and arrived at the main hall.<br/><br/>“Clan leader, he chose that Dragon Bead!”<br/><br/>When he arrived at the main hall, he spoke directly.<br/><br/>“Yes, as expected. Although it’s a fire dragon pearl, its level is too high. It should be of great benefit to his cultivation. What do you think of Him?”<br/><br/>The Thunder Light clan’s clan leader said without the slightest bit of surprise.<br/><br/>“His character is still not bad. He won’t be that kind of ingrate.”<br/><br/>The second Supreme Elder said with a smile.<br/><br/>“Yes, the disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage, including that ancestral dragon, are doing very well.”<br/><br/>“It’s the clan leader!”<br/><br/>Lei Yuntian clenched his fists tightly and nodded his head heavily.<br/><br/>He knew very well that one should not compare talent and potential with someone of such a level. That was because he was just looking for trouble. He could just compare his strength.<br/><br/>He was just slightly weaker than the heavenly sting.<br/><br/>He still had a chance.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“The harvest from coming to the Lightning race this time is too great!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian opened the fire dragon bead when he arrived at the palace. His eyes were glowing.<br/><br/>After gathering the Thunder Feather, the incipient holy wings had become complete and his strength had improved.<br/><br/>Now that he had obtained another powerful fire dragon bead, it could improve the five elements greatly.<br/><br/>“I owe the Thunder Ray tribe a lot now. I have to pay them back in the future!”<br/><br/>He thought to himself and contacted the great elder of the Thunder Ray tribe.<br/><br/>Every time the Thunder Ray tribe gave birth to a big senior brother, they would hold a feast. Wang Xian informed the great elder and asked him to hold the feast in a year’s time.<br/><br/>Now, he had to upgrade the level of the five elements grinding first. In addition, there were still some matters to be decided.<br/><br/>After setting up a sign for seclusion, Wang Xian called the dark intense sky array over.<br/><br/>The last time, after Wang Xian gave him the ancient oil lamp, he went for an upgrade.<br/><br/>This time, his upgrade went smoothly and he didn’t encounter any special situations.<br/><br/>As for the domain that he was teleported to, it was still unknown.<br/><br/>An Lie’s strength had already reached level eight of a universe knight. This strength was already very strong.<br/><br/>When he first came to the inner part of the heaven-opening primal continent, he killed a muscle-headed snake. This allowed the strength of the sky array to reach level nine of a universe knight.<br/><br/>“Heaven-splitting chaotic land, you stay here and guard. Let me know if there’s anything!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian instructed and his figure disappeared immediately.<br/><br/>The next moment, he arrived at the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui sensed his arrival and immediately bowed respectfully.<br/><br/>“Yes, Prime Minister Gui. How’s the investigation of the nearby sea areas over the past few days?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, we are almost done with the investigation. If we go any further, we will reach the inner part of the heaven-splitting chaotic land. Dragon King, should we allow our disciples to enter the inner part?”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui asked him.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace had been recuperating for about 12 years. This was the longest time the dragon palace had recuperated so far.<br/><br/>“How are the disciples of the Dragon Palace’s understanding of the inner part?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked him.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I understand a lot. I feel that I can head to the inner part of the heaven-splitting primordial land!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui said.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded slightly and agreed with him.<br/><br/>“The internal forces are all relatively strong. In the past, the Dragon Palace could only be considered as an ordinary force. Let them enter the inner part of the land together or to train alone. Let them follow the lineage of the ancestral dragon!”<br/><br/>He said after a moment of silence.<br/><br/>At present, the Dragon Palace was not too strong except for him. If he didn’t stay in the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace wouldn’t be as powerful.<br/><br/>After all, in the internal training, the forces in some cities were not weaker than the Dragon Palace in terms of peak experts.<br/><br/>He might as well let the disciples imitate the ancestral dragon bloodline and train themselves to improve.<br/><br/>“I agree with you. There are more opportunities in the heaven opening primordial land. Each of us disciples of the Dragon Palace will have our own opportunities. If we spread them out, perhaps we can improve them qualitatively.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui agreed.<br/><br/>“You can arrange this matter. Let an lie work hard. If any disciple obtains resources to improve themselves, let him send them back.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian instructed.<br/><br/>If the disciples of the Dragon Palace were to go out for training and hunt a large number of desolate beasts, they would have to return to the Dragon Palace if they wanted to upgrade.<br/><br/>If they were to fly by themselves, it might take too much time. They could inform an lie about this.<br/><br/>Moreover, if they were to encounter some opportunities and wanted to step into the land of opportunities, an lie would be of great use.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui nodded his head and immediately began to instruct and prepare.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly. With a move of his palm, the five elements millstone appeared in his hand and the fire dragon bead appeared as well.<br/><br/>“Next, it’s time to upgrade the Five Elements Millstone.”<br/><br/>He mumbled.<br/><br/>The level of this fire dragon bead was very high. Even if the five elements millstone was upgraded by one level, it might still be able to achieve a considerable upgrade.<br/><br/>However, if one wanted to break through two levels consecutively, it might be a little difficult.<br/><br/>“This absorption will take at least two months!”<br/><br/>He muttered. He was not in a hurry as he continued to refine and absorb.<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. The members of the Dragon Palace formed groups of three to five or left alone under Prime Minister Gui’s organization.<br/><br/>The group of pure-bred divine dragons all left.<br/><br/>They embarked on a journey!<br/><br/>Even Xiao Lan and the rest of them left. Unlike the members of the Dragon Palace, Xiao Lan and the rest of them went to the land of mountains and seas where desolate beasts were rampant.<br/><br/>Lan Qingyue wanted to follow them on a long journey but was stopped by Wang Xian. Although the group of girls were stronger, there was no need for them to go out and take risks.<br/><br/>More than a million disciples of the Dragon Palace were enough to go out.<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>Two months later, the Five Elements Millstone had completed its evolution!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
