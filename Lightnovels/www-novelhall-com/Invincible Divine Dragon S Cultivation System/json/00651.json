He said that he would reach the invincible zone in two years and he is already on his way. is he preparing to walk his own Invincible Road?”<br/><br/>“If the dragon king can really sweep the entire invincible zone, then the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace will be invincible below the universe Dominator!”<br/><br/>“The Dragon King is so fierce, so strong, so domineering. He is my idol for Life!”<br/><br/>“Hahaha, I wonder if the Dragon King can sweep the entire invincible zone. If he can’t do it, then it will be a huge loss of face!”<br/><br/>“The Dragon King is very strong, but some crazy demons in the invincible zone are also very terrifying!”<br/><br/>The disciples of the countless races discussed and were slightly excited!<br/><br/>Many people even said that this was the invincible path of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>It was also the invincible path of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>If the Dragon King could really sweep across the invincible zone, then he would undoubtedly be invincible below the peak of the race!<br/><br/>Some experts favored the Dragon King, while others didn’t!<br/><br/>But no matter what, this action of the Dragon King was very respectable!<br/><br/>Who Dared to say that they could sweep the invincible zone?<br/><br/>Even a real level one universe overlord powerhouse would not dare to say that, right?<br/><br/>In the past few years, due to Wang Xian and the large number of invincible zone powerhouses appearing in the inner continent, everyone had a better understanding of the invincible zone!<br/><br/>In the invincible zone, there were some powerhouses who could fight against universe overlords. They were absolutely terrifying!<br/><br/>There were also some terrifying mad demons who would fight to the death!<br/><br/>However, there seemed to be only about ten known mad demons!<br/><br/>“Arrogant and presumptuous. You want to sweep the entire invincible zone alone? I’m afraid that within the invincible zone, dozens of experts working together can destroy the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>“Dozens? That’s looking down on the Dragon King Too Much. I think that a dozen or so strong old monsters can destroy the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>“A monster like the supreme water demon king could be killed by a dozen old monsters. Although the Dragon King is stronger than the supreme water demon king, how strong can he be?”<br/><br/>“I heard that the Forbidden Madness has a grudge with the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. I’m afraid that the Forbidden Madness will have a big fight with the Dragon King this time. By then, we’ll be able to understand the Dragon King’s strength!”<br/><br/>While the experts of the inner continent of the heaven opening desolation were discussing, some old monsters of the Invincible Zone also received the news.<br/><br/>They scoffed at this!<br/><br/>Many old monsters agreed with the Dragon King’s strength!<br/><br/>However, if you were arrogant enough to sweep across the invincible zone, that would be too arrogant!<br/><br/>Once you entered and were besieged, even the old mad devil would be killed!<br/><br/>There were no ordinary people who could stay in the invincible zone!<br/><br/>If you provoked the public, you would die without knowing how!<br/><br/>“Hehe, are you here?”<br/><br/>At the same time, in a domain of the invincible zone.<br/><br/>There was an ocean here, and there were many huge ocean mountains!<br/><br/>At the top of one of the mountains, the mad demon restriction looked at the news on the universe AI with a Smile!<br/><br/>Not long ago, he wanted to kill Cold Light Sword God in the Dragon Palace’s domain to obtain a water-elemental innate supreme treasure!<br/><br/>He knew that this was his fault, but if the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King dared to stop him, then the Dragon King was his enemy!<br/><br/>If he didn’t kill him, he would feel indignant!<br/><br/>So, the Dragon King had to die!<br/><br/>“Invincible below the universe ruler realm, then let me test your strength. I want to see if you die or you die, invincible? Hehe!”<br/><br/>The Mad Hex let out a chuckle. He stood up slowly and flew straight towards the entrance of the Invincible Zone!<br/><br/>The entrance of the invincible zone was very, very big.<br/><br/>The probability of bumping into it at the entrance was not very high!<br/><br/>However, the Mad Hex still rushed over. If he could bump into it, he would fight it out!<br/><br/>If he did not bump into it, he would wait for the news from the Dragon King!<br/><br/>His thoughts were not strange to a mad demon-like existence!<br/><br/>When the mad demon prohibition arrived at the entrance of the invincible zone, there was still half a year left before the two-year period that Wang Xian mentioned!<br/><br/>He floated in the void crack and sat cross-legged in silence while waiting!<br/><br/>Time passed day by day!<br/><br/>Wang Xian was rushing over to the invincible zone while the mad demon prohibition was sitting cross-legged in the middle of the entrance while waiting!<br/><br/>The Mad Demon Prohibition would be the first enemy that Wang Xian would be able to defeat in the Invincible Zone!<br/><br/>“Eh? What’s That?”<br/><br/>The Mad Demon Prohibition was located in the middle of the entrance. It was neither eye-catching nor eye-catching. It was also eye-catching!<br/><br/>Four months later, the five experts of the Phoenix clan entered the invincible zone and happened to see the mad demon prohibition sitting cross-legged in the void!<br/><br/>When they saw this figure, they were slightly stunned!<br/><br/>The five experts of the Phoenix clan all frequented the invincible zone. They had also stayed in the invincible zone for tens of millions of years!<br/><br/>And one of them had made a name for himself in the Invincible Zone!<br/><br/>His strength was not weaker than the Supreme Water Monster King!<br/><br/>They quickly recognized the existence in the center of the Invincible Zone!<br/><br/>“Mad Demon Seal, it’s him. Why is he here?”<br/><br/>A Fire Phoenix looked at the mad demon seal sitting cross-legged in surprise, her eyes shining!<br/><br/>“Is he waiting for the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace?”? “I heard that the Dragon King stopped the mad demon seal from snatching the innate treasure of an expert in the territory of the Dragon Palace, and he didn’t give the mad demon seal any face. Now that he knows that the Dragon King is here, he wants to take revenge?”<br/><br/>“It’s very possible. This kind of mad demon will seek revenge for the smallest grievance. Once they are displeased, they will kill. He should be waiting here for the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>“This is going to be a good show. The strength of the mad devil prohibition alone should be comparable to the combined strength of the Grand Aquatic Demon King, the Black Tower Wizard, and the old scholar. Although he isn’t very strong among the mad demons, he isn’t something that top-tier experts can compare to!”<br/><br/>The five experts of the Phoenix clan discussed. They looked at each other and immediately spread the news!<br/><br/>They flew to the side but didn’t leave. Instead, they waited here!<br/><br/>The Mad Hex had obviously sensed their arrival, but there wasn’t the slightest fluctuation!<br/><br/>“HMM? Some experts have spread the news that the Mad Hex is waiting for the arrival of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace at the entrance of the Invincible Region!”<br/><br/>“The Mad Demon Seal is going to challenge the Dragon King? This is going to be interesting. He’s one of the truly terrifying experts in the invincible zone!”<br/><br/>“Haha, this is going to be interesting. The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is going to sweep across the invincible zone. Now, the first thing he’s going to face is the mad demon seal. I wonder who’s stronger!”<br/><br/>“If the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is defeated by the Mad Demon Seal, it would be a huge embarrassment. He would be beaten back by an expert before he could even enter the Invincible Zone?”<br/><br/>Soon, some of the experts in the invincible zone received the news. Those who were closer immediately rushed over.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
