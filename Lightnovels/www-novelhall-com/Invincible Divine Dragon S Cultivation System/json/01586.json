This time, these thirteen people had to be dealt with.<br/><br/>“Mm, these thirteen rising disciples are indeed terrifyingly talented. I don’t know if they have a special density on them, but this time, they won’t be able to escape.”<br/><br/>The eight regions master felt the powerful strength on his body and said with a face full of confidence.<br/><br/>With his current strength, if he wanted to completely destroy a primal chaos expert, given enough time, he could do it.<br/><br/>He wanted to subdue or get rid of the thirteen talented experts of the torrent region.<br/><br/>“Hehe, Alliance? Wedding? Today is the day of their destruction.”<br/><br/>The eyes of the surrounding experts shone with a fiery luster.<br/><br/>Soon, they would completely unify the torrent region.<br/><br/>At that time, the strength of their eight regions would receive a terrifying increase.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>In front of the river of chaos.<br/><br/>Festive music floated in the air. Countless disciples of the experts acted as guests as they excitedly arrived at the front.<br/><br/>There was a huge stage in front of them. This was the wedding venue for today.<br/><br/>The Grand Wedding had dispelled some of the haze in the torrent region.<br/><br/>At the front row were all the experts from the three regions, including the experts of the chaos realm from the three regions.<br/><br/>This wedding was the focus of the world.<br/><br/>“Let’s welcome four couples to the stage.”<br/><br/>On the stage in front, two heaven origin creation realm experts were the hosts. Their faces were filled with smiles as they spoke.<br/><br/>“Clap Clap Clap!”<br/><br/>“Clap Clap Clap!”<br/><br/>As the sound of their voice faded, millions of people stood up and clapped.<br/><br/>Couples walked out from the seats inside, followed by groomsmen and bridesmaids.<br/><br/>In the torrent area, the weddings of the strong were usually very luxurious.<br/><br/>As a group of strong people, the marriage between the three forces was naturally extremely luxurious.<br/><br/>Auspicious Beasts flew in the sky, scattering all kinds of beautiful skateboards.<br/><br/>A sacred rain of light fell from the sky. This was an energy rain that made people feel comfortable.<br/><br/>Melodious music was emitted from the mouths of the special races.<br/><br/>Four teams of rookies were led by Wang Lanjiang, Gongsun Ying ‘er, and three pairs of rookies walked out from behind one by one.<br/><br/>“Sigh. In the blink of an eye, all the children have grown up.”<br/><br/>At the bottom of the stage, Guan Shuqing and the other girls looked at the children on the stage and sighed with emotion.<br/><br/>“It has already begun. When they pay their respects to their elders, let’s go over.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said.<br/><br/>The group of girls nodded.<br/><br/>On the stage, Wang Lanjiang and the rest were all smiling. Today was his big day.<br/><br/>Wang yinyin, Wang Jiu’er, and the rest were also very happy because they were the bridesmaids and groomsmen.<br/><br/>“Please welcome the elders of the four couples.”<br/><br/>After swearing, the two hosts spoke with smiles on their faces.<br/><br/>In front of the stage, a group of powerhouses went up the stage happily.<br/><br/>Wang Lanjiang’s status in the torrent zone was that his parents were the kings. There were only a few elders from the sects.<br/><br/>Apart from these few elders from the sects, there were also a few elders from the divine sect who went up the stage.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at Guan Shuqing and the rest of the girls. With a wave of his arm, he brought them to the stage instantly.<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>The sudden appearance of Wang Xian and the rest made all the experts slightly shocked.<br/><br/>This included the three primal chaos level existences who were seated below the stage.<br/><br/>Their pupils constricted slightly as they looked at Wang Xian and the rest in astonishment.<br/><br/>They actually didn’t sense how the other party appeared on the stage.<br/><br/>“Eh?”Wang Lanjiang, Gongsun Ying ‘er, and the rest also looked at Wang Xian and the rest in astonishment.<br/><br/>“It’s been more than 200 million years. Children, it’s time for you to return!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at Wang Lanjiang and the rest and waved his arm with a smile on his face.<br/><br/>Guan Shuqing and the rest of the girls were also looking at them with sparkling eyes.<br/><br/>A Ray of light flashed past their souls. The sealed memories appeared in the minds of Wang Lanjiang, Wang yinyin, Wang Jiu’er, and the rest.<br/><br/>Wang Lanjiang and the others trembled, and then their eyes lit up.<br/><br/>“Father!”<br/><br/>“Mother!”<br/><br/>The sealed memories were restored, and they immediately shouted and ran toward them!<br/><br/>Guan Shuqing and the others spread their arms toward the children, smiling.<br/><br/>“It’s been more than 200 million years. You’ve grown up, and you’re going to get married!”<br/><br/>Guan Shuqing and the rest said with smiles on their faces.<br/><br/>“Mother, I really didn’t expect that we have been training for more than 200 million years.”<br/><br/>Wang Lanjiang and the rest were like children as they hugged their mother.<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood at the side and watched with a smile.<br/><br/>At this moment, all the strong disciples in the surroundings were looking at everything with faces full of shock.<br/><br/>Even the primal chaos realm experts from the three major factions in the torrent region had a slight change in expression as they stood up.<br/><br/>In these two hundred million years, their region had produced thirteen heaven-defying prodigies.<br/><br/>Each of them had the surname Wang, and each of them was only 200 million years old.<br/><br/>They had naturally suspected that they had even investigated the situation. The result was that these thirteen heaven-defying prodigies had been born in their torrent region.<br/><br/>There was evidence to prove it.<br/><br/>But now, a group of people suddenly appeared. It was actually Wang Lanjiang and his group’s parents.<br/><br/>This made them feel incredulous and shocked.<br/><br/>“This? ? What’s going on? Lord God, didn’t you personally investigate their whereabouts? Are there no problems?”<br/><br/>“Where did they come from? How could it be Wang Lanjiang and his group’s parents?”<br/><br/>“Oh my God, what’s going on? The 13 strongest elites in our torrent region have the same father?”<br/><br/>“What is the identity of this group of people who suddenly appeared?”<br/><br/>All the strong disciples in the surroundings were in an uproar.<br/><br/>Their eyes were wide open as they looked at everything and discussed.<br/><br/>“Father, back then, you blocked our memories and allowed us to train here. I didn’t expect 200 million years to have passed. Are You Satisfied?”<br/><br/>Wang Lanjiang hugged his mother, Lan Qingyue. He looked at Wang Xian like a child, waiting for his father’s evaluation.<br/><br/>The other 12 children also looked over with smiles.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
