If we want to kill them, we need a controller level existence.”<br/><br/>The Elven empress frowned when she saw this scene and spoke to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“Are you sure that the 12 ancestral wizards can rush here as soon as possible? How long will they take?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked!<br/><br/>“The twelve ancestral witches are the fastest. It will take about ten days. During these ten days, we can’t let these three Chaos Helminth Beasts leave this place! ”<br/><br/>The Queen of Elves replied!<br/><br/>“Alright, since we can’t kill them, it shouldn’t be a problem for us to trap them here!<br/><br/>Wang Xian said.<br/><br/>The Queen of Elves nodded. The two of them stopped attacking the three chaos helminth beasts crazily.<br/><br/>The three chaos helminth beasts sensed that the attacks from Wang Xian and the rest had weakened. Instead, they began to counterattack crazily.<br/><br/>They began to retreat in order to attack!<br/><br/>Wang Xian, Lin Niu, and the elven empress were also defending continuously!<br/><br/>“So Strong. The Elven empress and the Dragon King can’t destroy these three chaos helminth beasts. We need more experts to come over.”<br/><br/>“Although our elven empress and the rest can’t kill these three chaos helminth beasts, we can completely suppress them. Now, they are waiting for the other lords to come over and completely destroy them! ”<br/><br/>“Yes, the Lords want to completely exterminate these chaos helminth beasts. You must know that this is an existence comparable to the heavenly yuan creation level. A Heavenly Yuan Creation Level Chaos Beast is full of treasures.<br/><br/>If they can obtain it, it will be of great benefit to themselves and their race! ”<br/><br/>“It is extremely difficult to kill a heavenly yuan creation level powerhouse, but the chaos beasts are different. They do not have the various trump cards of the<br/><br/>Heavenly Yuan creation level, so the chances of killing them are much higher! ”<br/><br/>At the back, the disciples of the 9-origin universe were discussing in shock when they saw this scene.<br/><br/>Some of the disciples of the peak races also reported this to their Lord Heaven Origin Creation Realm!<br/><br/>The Heaven Origin Creation Realm Warriors who received this news were slightly stunned and immediately rushed over.<br/><br/>The corpse of a Chaos Beast was a huge treasure.<br/><br/>It was an almost impossible opportunity to obtain in the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>However, the heavenly fate realm powerhouses from the peak races were mostly frustrated.<br/><br/>They needed too much time to rush to the tree of Chaos!<br/><br/>Furthermore, they also learned that the elf race had informed the shamans!<br/><br/>The shamans were good at formations. Their speed was not something the other heavenly fate realm powerhouses could compare to!<br/><br/>Even so, the group of powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin creation realm were rushing over quickly.<br/><br/>Even if they could not get a share, they could still see if there were any treasures that they needed.<br/><br/>When the time came, they would carry out the trade!<br/><br/>In front of the tree of chaos, three chaos helminth beasts were attacking Wang Xian, the elven empress, and the rest.<br/><br/>The attacks were extremely fierce!<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian and the elven empress were able to defend against them<br/><br/>witn ease!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, Elven empress, we are here. One for each of you. When the time comes, our wizard clan will give you some rewards! ”<br/><br/>Ten days passed in the blink of an eye!<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the elven empress managed to defend against the attacks of the chaos helminth beasts for ten days.<br/><br/>These ten days were nothing to Wang Xian and the elven empress.<br/><br/>The war between the elemental gods could last for tens of millions of years or even hundreds of millions of years. This Little Battle of theirs was really nothing!<br/><br/>“Alright, one each! ”<br/><br/>The Elven empress sensed the arrival of the twelve ancestral witches and revealed a smile on her face. “Scatter them first, then one each! ”<br/><br/>“No Problem! ”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard that, a smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>He roared, a side of the position, Lin Niu is also a roar!<br/><br/>They’re headed straight for the two Chaos Worms!<br/><br/>Melee!<br/><br/>These days, they have almost touched the chaos worm beast!<br/><br/>The chaos helminth isn’t very aggressive.<br/><br/>The most powerful thing is their defense.<br/><br/>Therefore, Wang Xian and the Linniu charged forward without the slightest bit of worry!<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! ”<br/><br/>When the chaos helminth saw Wang Xian and the rest counterattacking, their heads that had fused together looked over at the same time and spewed out terrifying quicksand!<br/><br/>The quicksand was mixed with the power of Chaos!<br/><br/>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! ”<br/><br/>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! ”<br/><br/>The Elven empress held her bow and aimed at one of the heads of the Chaos Helminth. She began to unleash her strongest attack power! “12 heaven revolving formation, 12 demon slaying swords! ”<br/><br/>At the back, the 12 ancestral witches appeared completely.<br/><br/>They let out a low roar and the 12 figures stood in their fixed positions.<br/><br/>Above their heads, 12 sharp swords that contained terrifying energy condensed together.<br/><br/>The sharp swords attacked directly at the head of one of the Chaos Helminth Beasts!<br/><br/>The attack immediately covered the three Chaos Helminth Beasts!<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the Linniu flew over and swept their dragon tails at the head of one of the Chaos Helminth Beasts!<br/><br/>The Linniu’s single eye emitted a blood-red glow as it attacked as well!<br/><br/>The three attacks were aimed at the three Chaos Helminth Beasts respectively!<br/><br/>The three chaos helminth beasts felt the terrifying attack and their faces were filled with shock!<br/><br/>When they saw that they were locked onto, they hurriedly started to dodge!<br/><br/>Their bodies also started to separate!<br/><br/>“The 12 ancestral magi of the Magus clan are here! ”<br/><br/>“The 12 experts of the Magus clan are here. They are so fast and powerful. ”<br/><br/>“The 12 ancestral magi have opened up a new path. Before they even reached the heavenly fate realm, they already possessed extraordinary strength, creating the glory of the Magus clan! ”<br/><br/>“The Wizard clan is still fierce. Each and every one of the Wizard clan is more ruthless. No one dares to underestimate their trump cards! ”<br/><br/>At the back, a group of strong disciples saw the arrival of the 12th ancestral wizard. When they saw the terrifying sharp sword, they were all filled with shock!<br/><br/>Some of the strong disciples from the nine-origin universe looked in the direction of the Wizard clan, their eyes filled with fear.<br/><br/>The core disciples of the entire Wizard clan were only about one million.<br/><br/>It was even fewer than the number of powerful disciples of the royal clan!<br/><br/>But No clan dared to underestimate them.<br/><br/>The twelve ancestral wizards did not reach the heavenly fate realm, but they had such terrifying strength!<br/><br/>Who knew how strong the other great wizards and the powerful ones would<br/><br/>What trump cards would they have!<br/><br/>After all, the Wizards were the most powerful existences in every calamity. Even in the belief universe, there were legends and records about the Wizards!<br/><br/>“Split up, one for each person!”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian saw the three chaos helminth beasts split up, and his gaze was locked on the one he was attacking!<br/><br/>“Nine-origin Dragon Realm! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian growled in a low voice, and energy enveloped him!<br/><br/>Plow Ox’s body moved as he dashed forward in close combat!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
