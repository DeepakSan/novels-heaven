All the resources had been used up!<br/><br/>“The resources that I have used up to upgrade are too huge!”<br/><br/>He couldn’t help but Exclaim!<br/><br/>It was no exaggeration to say that the resources that Wang Xian had devoured this time, even if it was the unfettered forbidden land, he wouldn’t be able to take them out!<br/><br/>Perhaps the unfettered forbidden land and the flowing water forbidden land had more resources than the lair of the Unicorn Ox!<br/><br/>This was mainly because the unicorn ox did not have any subordinates and did not need to consume resources!<br/><br/>Other than what he used, all the other resources were stored away.<br/><br/>However, it was still a little lacking!<br/><br/>“If I were to absorb and improve these 5% of the resources, I would probably need tens of millions of years in a treasured land. If I were to rely on my cultivation to improve here, it might take hundreds of millions of years! ” Wang Xian calculated in his heart.<br/><br/>As for bringing all the resources in the Dragon Palace over, the effect was not great!<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace was currently in the stage of improvement, so there were not many resources!<br/><br/>Even if he were to bring all the resources over for him to use, the effect would not be great!<br/><br/>As for the treasured land, he really did not know about it.<br/><br/>The abyss of Demonic Beasts had a treasured land that could speed up cultivation. However, once he reached there, he would probably be killed by the Asgardian demon god!<br/><br/>(‘I should just cultivate here. A few hundred million years would be fine!”<br/><br/>After thinking about it, Wang Xian could only cultivate here.<br/><br/>To be able to achieve a breakthrough in a few hundred million years, this speed was extremely fast!<br/><br/>One had to know that Wang Xian’s current improvement was only slightly weaker than breaking through to the Heaven’s origin!<br/><br/>He sat cross-legged and began to quietly absorb the spiritual energy of Heaven<br/><br/>and earth, converting it into Dragon Energy!<br/><br/>He was improving bit by bit.<br/><br/>At the side, the improvement of the Tai Chi Dragon disc with the five elements grinding was also very slow!<br/><br/>As for the injuries on the Linniu’s body, it would take at least a few hundred million years for him to slowly recover!<br/><br/>There was no rush at all!<br/><br/>“Clang, Clang, Clang! ”<br/><br/>And when Wang Xian’s real body began to absorb the spiritual energy to cultivate!<br/><br/>At the fifth level of the abyss of Magical Beasts, Wang Xian’s void dragon body was engaged in a battle.<br/><br/>A battle could allow one to break through their shackles quickly!<br/><br/>During these tens of thousands of years, Wang Xian first came to the fourth level. After killing some magical beasts there, he encountered some weaker magical beasts.<br/><br/>Following that, he came to the fifth level!<br/><br/>After tens of thousands of years of battle, his mastery of the Heaven’s origin sword technique had improved a lot.<br/><br/>At the same time, his understanding of the space attribute had also improved tremendously!<br/><br/>It was possible that his next breakthrough would only be a few tens of millions of years at most!<br/><br/>Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief after easily killing the two demonic beasts in front of him who were at level six of the Universe Dominator!<br/><br/>He sat cross-legged on the ground, absorbed some energy and began to recuperate!<br/><br/>“Over here, there are fluctuations of the space attribute over here. It’s very likely that it’s that fellow!”<br/><br/>At the same time, at a spot not far away from Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Seven to eight figures were teleporting continuously.<br/><br/>At the center, a middle-aged man was holding a magic compass in his hand.<br/><br/>Looking at the guidance on the magic compass, he opened his mouth and spoke. His eyes were sparkling!<br/><br/>“We have already checked the position of the fourth level of the abyss of Magical Beasts. He should be on the fifth level. If we can confirm that it’s him, we will kill him immediately! ”<br/><br/>A woman beside the middle-aged man said coldly with a fierce look in her eyes!<br/><br/>“With our strength, we can easily kill him in an instant. He won’t even be able to react!”<br/><br/>The middle-aged men beside him said with smiles!<br/><br/>“That Kid’s body contains a great opportunity. According to junior brother Xu Ni, in the universe ruins, he was able to break through the demon pillars and obtain a large number of treasures. There might be a big secret on his body. ”<br/><br/>“And that sword technique is indeed very powerful. If we can obtain it, it can increase our strength by a lot! ”<br/><br/>A middle-aged man’s eyes flashed with light as he spoke!<br/><br/>“It’s hard to say if we can obtain that powerful sword technique, but we can definitely obtain those 40 powerful treasures. These are 40 top-grade space swords. It’s really hard to imagine how this kid obtained them! ”<br/><br/>“Even I am envious of his talent and fortune, but it’s a pity that he isn’t a disciple of our forbidden space. He is also quite high-profile. He actually dares to show off so many treasures. He doesn’t know what’s good for him! ”<br/><br/>The middle-aged man holding the magic compass in the center said with a smile!<br/><br/>They were all great beings from the forbidden space.<br/><br/>The middle-aged man in the center had already reached the Level 7 universe ruler realm!<br/><br/>A level seven of the universe dominator with spatial attributes could be considered a powerhouse in this universe!<br/><br/>And their target this time was Wang Xian!<br/><br/>They listened to some information from saint son Xu Ni. Under his suggestion, they turned their attention to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>They were interested in the resources in Saint Son Wang Xian’s hands as well as the great opportunities that might exist.<br/><br/>Even the experts from their forbidden space were extremely tempted!<br/><br/>They could not resist the temptation and decided to make a move against Wang Xian!<br/><br/>Among the eight of them, the weakest one was at the level six of the universe dominator.<br/><br/>If they wanted to kill Wang Xian, it would be an easy kill!<br/><br/>After all, Wang Xian was at the level five of the Universe Dominator!<br/><br/>He could definitely kill him instantly.<br/><br/>Even if he had a treasure to revive him, he would not know how he died!<br/><br/>After searching for thousands of years in the abyss of Demonic Beasts, they finally found a trace!<br/><br/>The group of eight concealed themselves and continued to fly forward!<br/><br/>“It’s him!<br/><br/>After flying for more than ten minutes, they immediately discovered Wang Xian ‘s figure!<br/><br/>When they saw the figure sitting cross-legged on the ground, their eyes were filled with excitement and greed.<br/><br/>Disregarding the other treasures, just the forty top-grade space swords were a huge treasure to them!<br/><br/>Among the eight of them, most of them only had one top-grade space treasure.<br/><br/>It was not even a space sword!<br/><br/>It was a supplementary one!<br/><br/>It was far from being comparable to a top-tier spatial sword! “I’ll go and kill it instantly. All of you wait here!”<br/><br/>The Master of the universe at level seven in the center said.<br/><br/>As soon as he finished his sentence, his figure had already disappeared! He was two levels higher than Wang Xian. He could kill him instantly with ease!<br/><br/>At the same time, at the position below.<br/><br/>Wang Xian, who was recovering his energy and training for a short while, sensed something when the eight of them arrived!<br/><br/>Although Wang Xian’s void dragon body was a little weak, his senses were still very terrifying!<br/><br/>Seeing that they were actually trying to kill him, Wang Xian was slightly stunned!<br/><br/>He opened his eyes and a virtual image of a divine dragon appeared behind him!<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s body of the Void Divine Dragon was very weak. He was still at the level five of the Overlord realm.<br/><br/>Therefore, Wang Xian had left some tricks on this body of his!<br/><br/>Some life-saving tricks!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
