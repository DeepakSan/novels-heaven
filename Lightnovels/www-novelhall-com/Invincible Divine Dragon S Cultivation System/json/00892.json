That way, he would be able to wait for the opportunity to strike!<br/><br/>However, he had some misgivings!<br/><br/>What if the belief universe sent a heaven’s origin creation directly in and killed Wang Xian before leaving immediately? The Heaven’s origin creation space behemoth in the starry universe would not be able to react in time!<br/><br/>If they waited here for a while, they would be able to encounter the gods who believed in the universe. That would be a huge harvest!<br/><br/>Wang Xian helped Lin Wenluo to set up the place. It took them several decades to complete the setup!<br/><br/>Following that, they came to the center and waited quietly!<br/><br/>This was a stupid method. They could only rely on luck!<br/><br/>There was no other way!<br/><br/>On a planet in the starry sky, Lin Wenluo sat in front of the machine and checked the situation of the scanners.<br/><br/>Wang Xian, Lan Qingyue, and the rest were waiting by the side.<br/><br/>An lie was also called over by Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Once they encountered the gods who believed in the universe, Wang Xian would get an lie to bring them over and kill them quickly!<br/><br/>Time passed day by day!<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest were not in a hurry. They waited quietly.<br/><br/>According to his speculation, the other party should pass by here within 50 years!<br/><br/>As for when exactly he would pass by during these 50 years, it was unknown!<br/><br/>Year after year, year after year, they waited.<br/><br/>At the same time, in a distant starry sky ahead, an army of the belief universe and a palace was flying at high speed.<br/><br/>More than a million gods and believers all had ugly expressions!<br/><br/>This incident had exceeded the expectations of all the gods and believers in the belief universe.<br/><br/>No one had expected that the eight gods who had borrowed the starfield fragment, as well as the two palaces and more than 200 rank seven gods, would all be killed by the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King!<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace’s ancient god Feeding Kun master already had the strength comparable to their peak gods!<br/><br/>The strength of peak gods, two existences at this level, was enough to destroy the army of their 21 palaces.<br/><br/>Even if they escaped slowly, they would all be massacred!<br/><br/>Currently, the only power in the belief universe that was comparable to peak gods was the starfield fragment!<br/><br/>Therefore, after receiving this news, the 24 temples of the belief universe immediately issued the order to retreat!<br/><br/>They issued the order to withdraw from the belief universe!<br/><br/>Because the Dragon Palace Dragon King and the others were no longer something that the belief universe could contend against!<br/><br/>They had to think of a new way!<br/><br/>In order to prevent the Dragon Palace from taking revenge, they had to return immediately!<br/><br/>The 21 armies ot the palace quickly returned. They did not return together, but spread out!<br/><br/>Once they returned together, their goal would be huge. If they met the Dragon Palace Dragon King, their faith in the universe would be in trouble!<br/><br/>Thus, the 21 legions split up!<br/><br/>Some even split up the entire Legion into more than a dozen and left, flying towards the Faith Universe Passage!<br/><br/>“I really did not expect that a small Dragon Palace Dragon King would actually force our faith universe to such an extent! ”<br/><br/>In the center of this legion, more than 100 level seven gods stood in front of the Space Beast!<br/><br/>Behind them, all the gods and believers of the belief universe were all on the level six space beast in order to return faster!<br/><br/>“The other peak races in the entire nine-origin universe are no match for us, but a monster like the Dragon Palace has appeared. According to the history of the Dragon Palace, their rise is indeed quite monstrous! ”<br/><br/>“This damn Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, I heard from my grandfather that the star field fragments of the eight palaces have been lost. It has already attracted the attention of the supreme god, the king of Pantheon!”<br/><br/>“Once the king of Pantheon is angered, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace will definitely die! ”<br/><br/>The group of Tier 7 gods chatted, their faces filled with anger!<br/><br/>If it wasn’t for the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, they believed that the universe wouldn’t be so miserable and so cautious!<br/><br/>“After we return this time, when we return, it will be time for the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace to pay the price! ”<br/><br/>The group of level seven gods spoke.<br/><br/>They swept their gaze across the surroundings. The Space Behemoth, which was at the level six realm, continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, there’s News! ”<br/><br/>More than ten years had passed. Lin Wenluo had been keeping an eye on all the surveillance information. One day, he saw the information transmitted from a scouting device. His eyes lit up and he immediately spoke up!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard the news, his eyes lit up. “Where is it located? Let me take a look! ”<br/><br/>“The information is transmitted from this scouting device. Dragon King, take a look. ”<br/><br/>An image immediately appeared in front of Lin Wenluo. In the image, a terrifying cosmic beast that was at the level six of the ruler flashed past.<br/><br/>On top of this cosmic beast that was at the level six of the ruler, there were many figures that believed in the gods of the universe and their disciples.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this, he narrowed his eyes slightly.<br/><br/>“Send the location to an lie! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said immediately!<br/><br/>Lin Wenluo nodded and immediately sent the information to an Lie’s mind.<br/><br/>An Lie’s figure moved and disappeared in an instant!<br/><br/>“Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>After more than ten seconds, an Lie’s figure returned to Wang Xian and nodded at him. (‘I found them. It should be the power of an army who believes in the universe. The army of the 21 palaces has spread out!”<br/><br/>“Alright, let’s destroy this one first! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes lit up as he spoke!<br/><br/>Although they couldn’t destroy all of them in one go if they split up, it would still be a huge gain even if they destroyed an entire legion of the palace.<br/><br/>There were millions of legions, and each Legion had 70,000 to 80,000 gods.<br/><br/>The rest of the believers were also top-notch existences below the gods!<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>An lie and Wang Xian vanished instantly. In the next second, they appeared in the Void.<br/><br/>“That army of believers is flying in that direction. ”<br/><br/>After teleporting to the demonic altar left behind by an lie, he pointed in a direction..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
