The combined combat strength was sufficient to kill an existence with the same strength as Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Shui Shayin was at this level.<br/><br/>When they fought, Wang Xian and the rest could kill him.<br/><br/>However, it was extremely difficult to kill him in a short period of time, or even in an instant!<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian had a solution now. He would exchange injuries for injuries and try his best to keep him alive.<br/><br/>He would use a powerful treasure to prevent him from using the treasure to escape in an instant!<br/><br/>“This fellow wants to keep me alive. He wants to wipe me out in an instant! ”<br/><br/>Shui Sha saw through Wang Xian’s thoughts and his expression changed drastically!<br/><br/>His body was attached to the divine spear. He slowly extended his palm and grabbed at Wang Xian’s penetrated body.<br/><br/>Although Wang Xian’s body was pierced by the divine spear, the divine spear did not penetrate his body completely.<br/><br/>However, at this moment, Wang Xian’s body could explode if the water-sand-like palm penetrated his body!<br/><br/>However, just as he was about to make a move, Lin Niu had already rushed over.<br/><br/>The strange devil symbols on his body went straight into the divine spear!<br/><br/>The symbols that contained terrifying erosion, destruction, and tearing immediately caused the entire divine spear to tremble violently.<br/><br/>Shui Shayin’s expression changed drastically as well. He tried to stop the invasion of the symbols frantically.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>However, at this moment, the five elements millstone above Wang Xian’s head sent down a wave of destructive energy and attacked the divine spear as well!<br/><br/>Wang Xian stretched out his hands and held the divine spear tightly. Waves of energy surged into it!<br/><br/>Shui Shayin’s expression changed drastically. Without any hesitation, he took out a special piece of leather from the divine spear. A drop of water energy dripped into the leather!<br/><br/>He wanted to escape from this place.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>However, just when he thought he was going to escape, a tree root suddenly appeared in the leather in his hands. It was an emerald green tree root!<br/><br/>Following that, he felt that his mind was in a trance.<br/><br/>A surge of energy was trying to control his body.<br/><br/>This made him horrified. His face was filled with fear.<br/><br/>“No!”<br/><br/>He roared crazily. His voice was filled with unwillingness!<br/><br/>The attack of the Unicorn Ox entered his body. The destructive force of the five elements grinding was destroying his life force.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was also attacking him.<br/><br/>The roots of the same root prevented him from escaping in an instant.<br/><br/>Death had arrived!<br/><br/>The life force of the water sand disappeared completely. His body came out from the divine spear and landed on the ground at the side.<br/><br/>Wang Xian pulled out the divine spear that was inserted into his body. The wounds on his body were healing rapidly.<br/><br/>He looked at the ground in front of him calmly.<br/><br/>There was another strong cultivator of the heaven’s origin realm hiding there.<br/><br/>The strong cultivator of the heaven’s origin realm who was with Bai Kefu Sheng noticed Wang Xian’s gaze. When he saw the corpse beside him, his body trembled violently!<br/><br/>He felt a tingling sensation on his scalp. He hurriedly fled backward and returned to the side of Bai Kefu Sheng and the rest!<br/><br/>At this moment, the sudden death of a heaven origin creation realm expert caused the entire arena and the entire battlefield to be silent!<br/><br/>Even the golden leopard from the six paths universe had his gaze slightly focused!<br/><br/>During these 100 million years, a large number of heaven origin creation realm experts had entered their six paths universe.<br/><br/>During these 100 million years, they had also continuously hunted and killed them.<br/><br/>The 100 million years of hunting and killing made them understand that none of the heavenly yuan creation realm experts that could enter their six paths universe were simple.<br/><br/>If the other party wanted to escape, even if they used their trump cards, it would be difficult to stop them!<br/><br/>It was too difficult to kill a heavenly yuan creation realm expert!<br/><br/>However, here, a heavenly yuan creation realm expert was actually killed in a short period of time.<br/><br/>The one who attacked was actually a heaven’s origin creator from another universe.<br/><br/>“Is it a great dao level existence?”<br/><br/>The death of a heaven’s origin creator halted the battle in the surroundings.<br/><br/>A Heaven’s origin creator stared at Wang Xian with a face full of fear as he growled in a low voice.<br/><br/>“No, it’s just two beginner-level Heaven’s origin creators. However, they have a lot of trump cards.”<br/><br/>Bai Kefu Sheng stared at Wang Xian. When he saw a powerhouse of the Heaven’s origin being killed by Wang Xian so quickly, his face was filled with fear!<br/><br/>He had been killed by Wang Xian once.<br/><br/>However, he had struggled for a period of time previously. This time, the powerhouse of the Heaven’s origin was killed so quickly.<br/><br/>Didn’t he use all his trump cards when he killed him?<br/><br/>“Tianci’s foster father actually killed a Heavenly Kismet realm expert from another universe. Oh My God, he’s so strong! ”<br/><br/>The powerful disciples of the Mu Li tribe widened their eyes in shock when they saw this scene.<br/><br/>pet… “. “No, didn’t his foster father let that Lord Godly beast follow Tianci on his birthday?”? “This Godbeast has been following tianci for more than 90 million years. I thought it was just a pet, but I didn’t expect it to be a heavenly creation -level Lord! ”<br/><br/>Mu Liyin c er’s older brother looked at the Unicorn Ox and couldn’t help but Exclaim!<br/><br/>The Unicorn Ox that had been following tianci all along, they even had a pet that was given to Tianci by his godfather.<br/><br/>The result? ?<br/><br/>An existence at the Heavenly Yuan creation realm.<br/><br/>A supreme existence!<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>When the surrounding strong disciples heard this, they were a little dazed.<br/><br/>Especially those who knew Tianci and had seen the unicorn ox, they were even more in disbelief.<br/><br/>“No Wonder Mu Li Tianci is so strong, so monstrous, he has a heavenly Yuan creation realm treasure, and he has a foster father at the Heavenly Yuan creation realm, as well as a divine beast at the Heavenly Yuan creation realm who has been protecting him all along! ”<br/><br/>At the Nine River Tribe, Gong Cheng was staring at his grandfather with his mouth agape.<br/><br/>“What kind of immortal brother-in-law is this?”<br/><br/>Gong Cheng’s younger brother was staring with his eyes wide open.<br/><br/>Today, he felt that he had learned something new!<br/><br/>“I haven’t seen you for a few days. Dragon King, you have become stronger again. However, what is going on? The Ultimate Treasure of Tianyuan Destiny is right beside you. Why didn’t you take it away?”<br/><br/>The twelve ancestral witches looked at Wang Xian who had instantly killed an expert of Tianyuan. They looked at each other with shock in their eyes.<br/><br/>They knew that Wang Xian had not broken through for too long.<br/><br/>However, he was able to kill an expert of Tianyuan so easily.
