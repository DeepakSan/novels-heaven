Go<br/><br/>The six great races supported the Holy Dragon bloodline and were about to unify the Holy Dragon Clan!<br/><br/>This news quickly spread through the universe ai!<br/><br/>As for the unification of the Holy Dragon Bloodline, there were no powers, and no great beings remained doubtful!<br/><br/>If the Holy Dragon bloodline wanted to unify the Holy Dragon Clan for the first time, when they felt that it might require a long period of unification, then the unification of the Holy Dragon bloodline this time, in the eyes of all the great beings of the races.., was completely easy!<br/><br/>That’s right, easy!<br/><br/>Because this might contain the will of the peak race!<br/><br/>The angel race said that they would help the Holy Dragon bloodline unify the Divine Dragon Clan, so who could stop them?<br/><br/>Nothing!<br/><br/>The other peak races wouldn’t offend the angel race because of this!<br/><br/>The unification of the Divine Dragon Clan might be completed very soon when all the experts and disciples arrived!<br/><br/>Even now, the Dragon Palace had displayed terrifying strength!<br/><br/>But unfortunately, there were too many helpers from the Sacred Dragon clan this time!<br/><br/>Such strength could make all the forces despair!<br/><br/>The six great clans belonged to the subsidiary races of the Angel clan, and they were also the most core subsidiary races.<br/><br/>Each of them was no weaker than the Sacred Dragon Clan!<br/><br/>How could the ancestral dragon clan resist such strength?<br/><br/>How could the Dragon Palace resist it?<br/><br/>Even if they joined forces, they wouldn’t be able to resist it!<br/><br/>“How can this be? The six great clans are helping the Sacred Dragon clan unify the Divine Dragon Clan? How can this be? What are the Angel clan doing? Why do they want the Sacred Dragon Clan to unify the Divine Dragon Clan?”<br/><br/>The Ancestral Dragon Clan had benefited the most from the terrifying power that had erupted from the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>They had begun the Great Migration and gathered together before moving to a place closer to the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>They had even agreed with the Dragon King that both sides would open up the teleportation array after their migration.<br/><br/>They were not afraid of the Sacred Dragon Clan at all after joining forces with the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>They were not afraid even if the Sacred Dragon Clan had some helpers!<br/><br/>But they didn’t expect that they would have so many helpers this time!<br/><br/>They could even tell at a glance that the angel race was completely involved!<br/><br/>The six great races plus the Holy Dragon Bloodline, even if they teamed up with the Dragon Palace, they weren’t a match!<br/><br/>There was simply no way to fight!<br/><br/>“What do we do? What do we do now?”<br/><br/>In the virtual space of the Universe AI, the 13 pinnacle warriors of the ancestral dragon bloodline gathered together again to discuss.<br/><br/>Their expressions were all extremely unsightly!<br/><br/>Just a moment ago, the situation had turned for the better, yet they didn’t expect to face an even deeper hell!<br/><br/>“Don’t tell me, we have to submit? Submit to these dogs of the Holy Dragon Bloodline?”<br/><br/>An azure dragon couldn’t help but growl!<br/><br/>This power caused them to lose the confidence to resist!<br/><br/>“If we don’t submit, we’ll die. Their power is too strong, even if our leader ancestral dragon is still here, we’re still not their match. What do we do now?”<br/><br/>The peak experts of the ancestral dragon lineage had already lost their backbone. Faced with such a situation, they were filled with helplessness!<br/><br/>This strength was not something they could resist!<br/><br/>They could not resist.<br/><br/>If they did not submit, they would die!<br/><br/>If they submitted, there was still hope for them to survive!<br/><br/>If they resisted, the ancestral dragon lineage would definitely bleed like a river!<br/><br/>There were too many disciples whose lives were in their hands.<br/><br/>Their decisions were related to the fate of the entire ancestral dragon bloodline!<br/><br/>“Let’s ask the Dragon King. We’ll see how he decides on this matter. If the Dragon King says to resist, we’ll continue to move and form an alliance to resist. I don’t believe that the combined forces of the Dragon Palace and us can’t resist a bit. If the Dragon King can’t do anything either, then we…”. ”…”<br/><br/>The Golden Dragon King said with a gloomy face!<br/><br/>The rest of the experts from the ancestral dragon lineage frowned and were filled with helplessness!<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>They pondered for a moment and nodded<br/><br/>Let’s look at the decision of the Dragon Palace. If the Dragon Palace wants to resist, they will resist!<br/><br/>If the Dragon Palace wants to surrender, then they will surrender too!<br/><br/>“Let me contact the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The Golden Dragon King said with a dark expression!<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>However, at this moment, Wang Xian had just walked out from a teleportation formation!<br/><br/>He did not know about the information on the universal AI.<br/><br/>He did not see the statement of the Holy Dragon lineage either!<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian’s universal ai kept sending him urgent news!<br/><br/>He could not see the long-distance teleportation just now, so he could only check it now!<br/><br/>Taking out the universal AI, Wang Xian first took a look at the message sent by Prime Minister Gui!<br/><br/>When he saw the message, he was slightly stunned!<br/><br/>The six major forces wanted to help the Holy Dragon lineage unify the Divine Dragon Tribe!<br/><br/>He frowned and looked around. Then, he came to a restaurant!<br/><br/>He opened the universal AI and searched for the statement about the Holy Dragon lineage!<br/><br/>When he saw the information, he narrowed his eyes slightly!<br/><br/>Following that, he looked up some information about the six great races!<br/><br/>The six great races, the six advanced races that had existed since the beginning of the Cataclysm!<br/><br/>Each race was extremely powerful!<br/><br/>If taken alone, they were only slightly weaker than the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>This was when the information from the Golden Dragon King was sent over. Wang Xian opened it and took a look.<br/><br/>Looking at the information one by one, he was deep in thought!<br/><br/>The six major races, along with the Holy Dragon lineage, had more than 100 level three masters who were masters of the universe!<br/><br/>The number should be between 120 to 150!<br/><br/>This number was absolutely terrifying!<br/><br/>It was five times more than the Dragon Palace and the ancestral dragon lineage!<br/><br/>If they were to really fight, they wouldn’t be a match for them!<br/><br/>Furthermore, there might be the light tribe behind this.<br/><br/>“It’s impossible to submit!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled and took out his universal AI to search.<br/><br/>After nearly a year of traveling, Wang Xian was almost at the vicinity of the Holy Dragon lineage!<br/><br/>The city that he was currently in belonged to a city that was open to the public by a high-level tribe!<br/><br/>His eyes flickered slightly as he looked at the map of his surroundings. Slowly, he narrowed his eyes!<br/><br/>Finally, he set his eyes on one place!<br/><br/>With the current strength of the Dragon Palace, they could not resist the invasion of the six great races and the Holy Dragon Bloodline.<br/><br/>However, if they wanted to invade, they would need more than a year even if they flew over!<br/><br/>In other words, the Dragon Palace could increase their strength in this one year!<br/><br/>And the fastest way to increase their strength was undoubtedly through war.<br/><br/>The best way was to kill the experts from the six major races, reduce their strength, and then increase the strength of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>With this, the Dragon Palace and the ancestral dragon lineage might be able to withstand their combined forces!<br/><br/>“I can’t hesitate anymore. Act Now!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with killing intent.<br/><br/>Since the six major races wanted to attack the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace would attack first!<br/><br/>Not all the subsidiary races of the Angel race were in the Divine Mountain of light!<br/><br/>Moreover, the angel race couldn’t let them stay in their own territory!<br/><br/>The six great races were all around the Divine Mountain of light!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
