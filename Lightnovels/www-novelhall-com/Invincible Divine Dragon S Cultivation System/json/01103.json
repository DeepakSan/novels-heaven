In that case, Wang Xian would play with them.<br/><br/>He could even put aside the matter of the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin.<br/><br/>Anyway, the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin was a matter of luck.<br/><br/>“Boss, what should we do?”<br/><br/>Lin Niu stared at Wang Xian and asked.<br/><br/>“First, we must be able to determine the location of the powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin in the Void Universe.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly as he had a plan in his mind.<br/><br/>“The six paths universe is very big. However, I reckon that many of the heaven origin creator powerhouses are like us. They are all searching for information on the heaven origin creation treasures in the six treasure lands. Under such circumstances, the chances of encountering other powerhouses are quite high. ”<br/><br/>Lin Niu said, “Boss, if we were to search, we should be able to find them.” Okay.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head. His eyes flickered slightly. “Let me contact the other powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin in the nine-origin universe.”<br/><br/>As he spoke, he took out a communication stone plate.<br/><br/>The communication stone plate was made by the twelve ancestral wizards. Not only could they communicate in the chaos, they could do so in this universe as well.<br/><br/>However, the powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin in the nine-origin universe didn’t really communicate with each other. They fought alone.<br/><br/>It was like coming to the six-origin universe to search for treasures.<br/><br/>If they really encountered the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin, how would they distribute it?<br/><br/>This was a huge problem. No one would give up on the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin.<br/><br/>There would even be fights over the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin. Under such circumstances, unless it was a special situation, the powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin in the nine-origin universe wouldn’t join forces.<br/><br/>They would not contact each other either.<br/><br/>Wang Xian sent a message to the elven empress, the Hetian Saint, and the other powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin in the universe.<br/><br/>Of course, this message was not sent to the Emperor of Phoenix.<br/><br/>The message was to inform them if they encountered any powerhouses of the Void universe.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Wang Xian also told them about being ambushed by them.<br/><br/>After the elven empress, the Hetian saint, and the Xuanwu clan’s Tianyuan Destiny Realm powerhouses received this news, they immediately responded.<br/><br/>The Void Universe was ugly to them. Naturally, they would not hide anything when Wang Xian asked for their information.<br/><br/>They would even pay special attention to it.<br/><br/>“The powerhouses from the Void Universe attacked the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. This might have something to do with us. ”<br/><br/>The twelve ancestral witches were slightly surprised when they received this message.<br/><br/>The ancestral witch with the head of a human and the body of a snake raised her eyebrows and said.<br/><br/>“It’s really possible, but after the Dragon King was attacked by them, it’s obvious that he has his eyes on them. He wants to keep fighting with them. TSK, TSK, this dragon king is really brave. He must take revenge. ”<br/><br/>An ancestral shaman beside him sighed slightly.<br/><br/>“This matter might have something to do with us. If the Dragon King wants to drag it out with them, we will gift him the Kong Wen so that we can continue to befriend him. ”<br/><br/>The ancestral shaman in the middle said.<br/><br/>“I agree. The Dragon King’s current potential has not reached its end. His current realm should not be at the peak of the Universe Dominator realm. When he improves again, his strength will be on par with ours. Moreover, the difficulty of his improvement is much easier than that of a heaven origin creator. We can invest in him! ”<br/><br/>The ancestral witches nodded in agreement.<br/><br/>Putting aside their previous cooperation, with Wang Xian ‘s potential, they felt that they could invest and build a good relationship with him.<br/><br/>“Alright, Pll send him the information! ”<br/><br/>The human-headed and snake-bodied ancestral witches nodded and sent their information over.<br/><br/>At the same time, Wang Xian, who was flying towards the grassland, was astonished when he saw the information sent by the 12 ancestral witches. “These 12 ancestral warlocks are very honest. They are even willing to give treasure to themselves for the time being.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the message and was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The treasure of the 12 ancestral warlocks could detect the location of the powerhouses in the Void Universe.<br/><br/>This was especially so in a universe like the six paths universe that did not have any spatial attributes!<br/><br/>Furthermore, the 12 ancestral warlocks told him about how they tricked and killed the powerhouses in the Void Universe.<br/><br/>“Could it be that the 12 ancestral warlocks had harmed the powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin manifestation in the Void universe, so the two powerhouses of the Void universe came to ambush us?”<br/><br/>Lin Niu, who was at the side, looked at this information and said! “It’s highly possible. However, they have chosen the wrong target! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and revealed a cold and sinister expression.<br/><br/>He didn’t care if it was because the twelve ancestral witches had killed them.<br/><br/>Since the experts of the Void Universe wanted to attack him, he had to retaliate.<br/><br/>Wang Xian sent a message back to the twelve ancestral witches.<br/><br/>Very soon, the twelve ancestral witches replied with an address.<br/><br/>“The twelve ancestral witches are in the Ajin mountain range. Let’s go look for them. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to the unicorn ox before flying towards the Ajin mountain range.<br/><br/>The Ajin mountain range was not very close to this place.<br/><br/>However, after Wang Xian gave up on heading to the grassland, they did not hide too much and flew at full speed.<br/><br/>Halfway through, they arrived at the location of a tribe and teleported there.<br/><br/>There was a teleportation formation in the six universes. This teleportation formation was created by the powerhouses of the six universes.<br/><br/>With the teleportation formation in place, Wang Xian and the rest took half a year to arrive at the Ajin mountain range.<br/><br/>“Dragon King. ”<br/><br/>Not long after entering the Ajin mountain range, the twelve ancestral witches came up to them. Their eyes swept over Wang Xian and Lin Niu as they greeted them with a smile.<br/><br/>“Thank you for gifting US treasures this time. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thanked them with a smile on his face.<br/><br/>“Hehe, there’s no need. The Void Universe is the enemy of all living beings in our nine-origin universe! ”<br/><br/>Ancestral Wu in the center shook his head with a smile. He waved his arm, and a compass containing space elements flew toward him.<br/><br/>“This compass is called Kong Wen. It can detect powerful space energy. In this universe, its effect has been greatly enhanced. You can sense it from a great distance. ”<br/><br/>“Not long ago, we also sensed a great being from the Void Universe through Kong Wen. We put a curse on him and killed him. ”<br/><br/>The ancestral wizard in the center introduced.<br/><br/>“All of you ancestral wizards are really powerful. You have all kinds of treasures! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes lit up. He took it and sensed it.<br/><br/>“Hehe, they are just small paths. Dragon King, you have to be careful when dealing with the experts from the Void universe. They are good at sneak attacks and escaping. You have to act according to your capabilities. ”<br/><br/>The ancestral wizard in the middle reminded.<br/><br/>(‘I know that. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded. He looked at the twelve ancestral wizards and asked with a smile, (‘I wonder if you have gained anything from the six paths universe?”<br/><br/>“Nothing at all. We are guessing that the Heaven’s origin destiny treasure might not have been completely born yet. ”<br/><br/>The ten-handed ancestral wizard shook his head..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
