Boom! Boom<br/><br/>A hundred years passed by in a flash. Inside the meteorite in front of the storm continent, a huge millstone was emitting a luster as waves of energy gushed out from it!<br/><br/>Beside it, there was a piece of ice metal that was seven to eight hundred meters in size!<br/><br/>“I’ve made a breakthrough. After more than a hundred years, the Five Elements Millstone has finally made a breakthrough!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled when he saw this scene!<br/><br/>It was very difficult to absorb the frost metal. The Five Elements Millstone took more than 100 years to complete the breakthrough!<br/><br/>After the breakthrough, the Five Elements Millstone had the strength to crush a level three dominator in the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>However, if he was here, he would still be no match for a dominator-level space beast!<br/><br/>“With the remaining frost metal and the metal obtained over the past 100 years, the five elements millstone should be able to gain a significant improvement after absorbing it. The improvement of the Taiji Dragon Plate should also increase by a lot!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes sparkled!<br/><br/>There were still many ice metal. The five elements millstone could still achieve a significant improvement.<br/><br/>As for the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, it would still take some time before it could be upgraded again. Of course, if he was lucky, he would be able to achieve a rapid improvement if he could obtain the metals with the darkness and light attributes.<br/><br/>Currently, on the storm continent, the seawater in the storm had already disappeared. Once again, there were meteorites.<br/><br/>“The current Five Elements Millstone is much stronger than mine!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements Millstone flew in front of him.<br/><br/>The current Five Elements Millstone could already kill a master of level three.<br/><br/>“Let’s go and look for trouble with the angel and Phoenix Race!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly. He swept his gaze forward and immediately flew out!<br/><br/>A hundred years had passed. He was prepared to go out and scam the powerhouses from the angel and Phoenix clans.<br/><br/>Once every hundred years, he would get some resources!<br/><br/>He smiled and took out the communication stone plate that he obtained from a group of demonic beasts. He looked at the current situation.<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>However, when he opened it, he realized that the information in the communication stone plate was even more explosive than before. It was obvious that more powerful disciples had entered the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>However, among the more explosive topics, there was indeed a large number of deaths of powerful disciples from the nine-origin Universe!<br/><br/>The reason for all of this was that when he entered the depths of the starry universe to search for life planets, he was killed by the space behemoth.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he looked at the information.<br/><br/>Other than that, there was also a large amount of news. There was a powerful disciple who had encountered a terrifying space behemoth.<br/><br/>Along with all sorts of news, the fact that a ruler-level space beast possessed its own domain was revealed.<br/><br/>Furthermore, some great disciple had even given names to some ruler-level space beasts and recorded down their powers and the scope of their domains!<br/><br/>In addition, there were also great disciple discussions from the 9-origin universe. Sometimes, when the weaker ones entered the Space Beast’s domain, the space beast would not launch an attack.<br/><br/>On the contrary, the stronger ones would definitely be attacked once they entered.<br/><br/>Of course, if the weaker ones entered the space Behemoth’s territory and went to the life planets to look for treasures, they would also be attacked.<br/><br/>In short, there were all kinds of information. Many pieces of information were of great use to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Of course, apart from these, there were also a lot of news about a certain expert obtaining a treasure for a breakthrough.<br/><br/>There were even rumors that there were experts from the invincible region who achieved a breakthrough and reached the ruler realm.<br/><br/>The Starry Universe was indeed a place with great opportunities.<br/><br/>This was the reason why even though the starry universe was dangerous, there were still many disciples of experts from the nine-origin universe rushing over.<br/><br/>If they were to encounter any opportunities, it would be a huge profit.<br/><br/>Especially for those disciples of experts who had not achieved a breakthrough for a long time!<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the messages one by one, and his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>He continued to fly outside.<br/><br/>After flying for ten days, he was floating in the air. With a wave of his arm, the five elements Millstone flew directly to the sky in front of him.<br/><br/>Waves of khaki-colored energy waves were transmitted over, stirring up the surrounding void.<br/><br/>The khaki-colored energy condensed into a huge earth ball that was like a star.<br/><br/>Wang Xian took out his communication stone plate and sent a message to the Angel clan.<br/><br/>He had encountered four space beasts when he found the treasure!<br/><br/>After sending the message, he moved his body and two gigantic figures of space beasts appeared beside him.<br/><br/>These two space beasts were the two he had encountered more than a hundred years ago. They were easily suppressed by him and placed in the mother nest.<br/><br/>Now, it was better to release them as bait.<br/><br/>Following that, Wang Xian hid in the surrounding void and waited for the fish to take the bait!<br/><br/>Not long after, the Angel clan sent him a message, asking him to activate the positioning ability of the communication stone plate.<br/><br/>After opening it, he waited quietly!<br/><br/>Five days passed very quickly. In his line of sight, three angels flew over.<br/><br/>These three angels flew over and scanned their surroundings.<br/><br/>“Eh? The strength of these three angels are all at the first level of the ruler realm!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was hiding in the void. When he saw the three angels, he frowned slightly.<br/><br/>Their strength was too weak!<br/><br/>“I hope their Angel Army can have a little more!”<br/><br/>He was looking forward to it.<br/><br/>“Eh? Those two space beasts? Come, Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>The three angels soon noticed the two space beasts and immediately flew over.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, not bad. Although the strength of these two space beasts is average, they are space beasts after all. Subdue Them!”<br/><br/>One of the Angels looked over and laughed loudly.<br/><br/>“Eh? Where are the disciples who reported to Our Angel Clan? They are not around?”<br/><br/>Another angel looked at him in confusion.<br/><br/>“He might have escaped, or he might have been killed!”<br/><br/>An expert from the Angel clan said indifferently, his gaze sweeping the surroundings.<br/><br/>“Suppress this space behemoth first, then see what treasures are on that special earthen yellow planet.”<br/><br/>An angel flapped his twelve wings, increasing his speed!<br/><br/>“Buzz!”<br/><br/>However, just as they got closer, a terrifying energy suddenly pressed down on their bodies.<br/><br/>This caused the three angels’expressions to change drastically, and their eyes revealed a look of terror.<br/><br/>“Not good, there might be even more terrifying space beasts here!”<br/><br/>An angel’s expression changed drastically, and he shouted loudly, “Run away from here!”<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>As soon as he finished speaking, they saw many terrifying meteorites flying towards them!<br/><br/>As they felt the attack power of these meteorites, their expressions changed drastically.<br/><br/>“This space beast is very strong, block it!”<br/><br/>“Battle Angel Army!”<br/><br/>An angel immediately shouted. With a wave of his arm, an angel Army appeared behind them!<br/><br/>The other two angels felt their hearts tighten. Without any hesitation, they released the Army of angels.<br/><br/>“There are only six battle angels who are at the level of a dominator. With the addition of the three of them, nine of them and the Army of angels, we should be able to make it!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled when he saw this scene.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
