Two months later, the Asgard battle pet will be held a grand auction. At that time, a universe knight level battle pet will be auctioned!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian and the rest left, a piece of information on the universe’s AI caused the entire Milky Way to be in an uproar.<br/><br/>What was the concept of a universe Knight Level Battle Pet?<br/><br/>Nowadays, anyone who saw a universe knight had to respectfully address him as Sir Knight-level.<br/><br/>Even a core disciple of a primary race of the universe had to address him as sir knight-level when he saw a knight of another primary race of the universe.<br/><br/>That was because a knight-level battle pet was considered a powerhouse in the universe.<br/><br/>Now that the Immortal Palace Battle Pet was bidding for a knight-level battle pet, one could imagine how many people were shocked.<br/><br/>Not to mention normal warriors, even the universe knights from the low-level races were shocked when they heard the news.<br/><br/>A knight was the stabilizing needle of a race.<br/><br/>A knight was extremely powerful and hard to kill.<br/><br/>Like the Milky Way, the powerful low-level races from the misty universe might not want to offend a low-level race like Shui Zhongshan who only had one knight.<br/><br/>This was like the nuclear weapons on Earth. If a weak country had such a nuclear weapon, it would be enough to make a big country fear it.<br/><br/>It was the same for universe knights.<br/><br/>If a universe knight was really pushed to the brink, he would have a long history and terrifying power. He would think about the disciples of his race all day long, and no power would be able to stand it.<br/><br/>Even the powerful race of the Wizard branch couldn’t stand it.<br/><br/>Just like the blazing turtle-winged beast. If he hid, the venerable level array formation would not be able to lock him down.<br/><br/>The reason why Wang Xian was able to suppress it was mainly because he knew the range of its location. In addition, he had the powerful spiritual energy such as the crescent moon illumination.<br/><br/>If the blazing turtle-winged beast escaped for tens of billions of light years, Wang Xian would not be able to suppress it.<br/><br/>The entire Milky Way was in an uproar because the Immortal Palace’s War Pets were selling venerable level war pets. Countless people were talking about it.<br/><br/>“In these two months, I’ll try my best to capture more war pets at the peak of the Celestial Emperor Realm.”<br/><br/>At the same time, Wang Xian, who had started this storm, had returned to the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>He did not stop. He led the Heaven Array and immediately flew into the Milky Way.<br/><br/>“To the isolated island on the sea.”<br/><br/>The isolated island on the sea was the land of the twin divine empires. Wang Xian had gone there once and obtained the acquired Spirit Treasure, sword scar.<br/><br/>The isolated island in the sea was even bigger than the volcano region. There were rumors of powerful universe knight dire beasts there.<br/><br/>Furthermore, they were not level one universe knight dire beasts.<br/><br/>Wang Xian wanted to suppress another universe knight level dire beast, but he had to do it within his capabilities.<br/><br/>There were still many existences in the Milky Way that he could not afford to offend.<br/><br/>He headed to the isolated island in the sea only to tame some peak-stage divine emperor dire beasts.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the Heaven Array moved very fast. A day later, they arrived at the isolated island in the sea.<br/><br/>The last time they came, they didn’t venture too deep into the island. This time, they had the crescent moon illuminating the sky. It was much more convenient.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Wang Xian was also waiting for a piece of news.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I can sense a great terror ahead.”<br/><br/>The two of them were floating in front of the isolated island in the sea. The Heaven Array looked ahead and said with sparkling eyes.<br/><br/>“Yes, there are powerful existences here.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>At this moment, a civil official of the Dragon Palace sent him some information about the isolated island on the sea.<br/><br/>While Wang Xian was dealing with the matters here, ao crab had already entered the crescent moon mystic realm with the crescent moon key and the civil officials of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Apart from the large number of treasures in the Crescent Moon Mystic Realm, there was another item that was extremely precious.<br/><br/>It was a book on the fourth level.<br/><br/>The books on the fourth level contained all sorts of information about the Milky Way.<br/><br/>They were all left behind by the Crescent Moon Venerable.<br/><br/>There were records about various powers and different parts of the Milky Way.<br/><br/>The civil official of the Dragon Palace sent him information about the isolated island on the sea.<br/><br/>“As expected, according to the records of the crescent moon venerable, there are desolate beasts at level two of the universe knights on the isolated island on the sea. They are very powerful and are called Silver Unicorns. On the isolated island on the sea, it is best not to kill the descendants of the silver unicorns wantonly.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the information and said to the sky array.<br/><br/>“Level two universe Knight?”<br/><br/>The eyes of the sky array flickered. Desolate beasts of such a realm were not something they could deal with.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, ao crab and the rest have swallowed the universe God Country of the Crescent Moon Knight. They should be able to have the strength of a level two universe knight, right?”<br/><br/>He asked Wang Xian who was beside him.<br/><br/>“Yes, according to the information that ao crab sent, it should be able to allow three to four devouring dragons to reach the level of a level two universe knight. However, this might take some time, and it’s not a short period of time.”<br/><br/>“It’s not that easy to devour the universe God Country of a level three universe knight, especially since their current strength is not strong.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said.<br/><br/>The God Country of the Crescent Moon Knight was indeed a huge resource for the devouring dragons.<br/><br/>However, it would take a long time to digest it.<br/><br/>“Other than the silver unicorn desolate beast, we can kill all the other desolate beasts. Let me check it out first.”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, he waved his arm and the crescent moon hovered in the sky.<br/><br/>A Ray of light enveloped the area in front of them.<br/><br/>Very soon, images appeared in their sight.<br/><br/>“This kind of auxiliary acquired Numinous Treasure is really powerful.”<br/><br/>The sky array looked at the information that was slowly appearing, and its eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>“It is very abnormal.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head. He looked at the desolate beasts within a radius of tens of billions of kilometers and flew over immediately.<br/><br/>Following that, their taming was very easy.<br/><br/>With the crescent moon shining in the sky, they locked onto the desolate beasts one by one and flew over to suppress them in an instant.<br/><br/>In less than ten days, Wang Xian and the rest had obtained seven battle pets at the peak of the Celestial Emperor Realm.<br/><br/>“It’s about time to announce some items for auction in the Milky Way.”<br/><br/>Ten days later, they flew out from the isolated island on the sea and did not continue to subdue and suppress the beasts.<br/><br/>The density of the desolate beasts on the isolated island on the sea was relatively high. However, in order to prevent any big movements, they did not dare to go deep into the center of the island.<br/><br/>If they provoked the desolate beast at the level of a silver unicorn universe knight, they could only flee.<br/><br/>Moreover, seven peak celestial emperor-level battle pets were enough.<br/><br/>Seven peak celestial emperor-level battle pets, coupled with a group of battle angels, the value of all the treasures added together was too high.<br/><br/>If there were any more, Wang Xian was afraid that the factions in the Milky Way wouldn’t be able to afford it.<br/><br/>“Let’s first spread the news of these seven peak celestial emperor-level battle pets. In another ten days, we’ll give them a king bomb.”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, he immediately got Mi Xin Lu to send this message.<br/><br/>On the universe’s AI, when the Immortal Palace Battle Pets updated the auction information, they were still shocked when they saw the seven peak god-emperor level battle pets. Even if there were universe knights, they were still shocked.<br/><br/>From start to finish, there were already more than a dozen peak god-emperor level battle pets sold by the Immortal Palace Battle Pets.<br/><br/>And so far, the items that the divine palace battle pets were auctioning had yet to be fully displayed.<br/><br/>They were very curious about how many treasures the divine palace would auction in the end.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
