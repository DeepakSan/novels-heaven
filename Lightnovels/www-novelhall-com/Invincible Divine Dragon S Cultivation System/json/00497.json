Instead, they thought that this was an opportunity for them.<br/><br/>An opportunity to attack the Dragon God.<br/><br/>The other citizens and warriors of the Hundred Cities Alliance didn’t put the Dragon Palace in their eyes.<br/><br/>Because they were strong enough to easily destroy the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>But now, they realized that they were wrong!<br/><br/>The destruction of Wu City was witnessed by more than ten warriors.<br/><br/>Discovered by them.<br/><br/>Soon, the news of the destruction of Wu City quickly spread through the universe AI.<br/><br/>Along with that, there were two other pieces of news.<br/><br/>Why Can’t we teleport to the 99 cities and the 9 star Lianzhu City?<br/><br/>Why are all our disciples and warriors in the 99 cities and the 9 star Lianzhu City Dead?<br/><br/>When the news of the destruction of Wu city spread out, it completely blew up the entire hundred city alliance, causing the alliance to fall into panic.<br/><br/>“What happened? Wu city was destroyed? Wu city was destroyed by the experts of the Dragon Palace? How is that possible?”<br/><br/>“How could such a huge city be destroyed so easily by the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>“Wu city was destroyed. It was indeed destroyed. It was even more terrifying than the last time when the Dragon Palace destroyed the old Star City and the Tianheng City. The entire city fell into a dead silence and became a dead city!”<br/><br/>“The nine-nine cities and the nine-star Lianzhu city seem to have changed. What’s going on? Is it the Dragon Palace’s Revenge?”<br/><br/>“How can any city be destroyed by the Dragon Palace? is our city going to be destroyed in the next moment?”<br/><br/>The news about Wu City and the nine-star Lianzhu city gradually caused some people to panic.<br/><br/>Soon, the news about nine-nine cities and nine-star Lianzhu city completely exploded.<br/><br/>Some people said that the two cities had become dead cities.<br/><br/>After this news was confirmed, it was completely boiling.<br/><br/>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”<br/><br/>“Damn it, how is this possible? How is this possible? We can’t contact nine-nine cities and nine-star Lianzhu City. The city Lord’s divine tablet has been broken!”<br/><br/>At the base of the Alliance of the Hundred Cities, a group of figures quickly flew toward the mountain where the Central Alliance leader was.<br/><br/>This time, all the experts at the base rushed over.<br/><br/>The destruction of the nine-nine cities, nine-star Lianzhu city, and Wu city caused all the cities to be a little terrified.<br/><br/>The group of experts flew to the Central Mountain Peak. They looked at each other and landed on it.<br/><br/>On the main peak, the Alliance Master of the Hundred Cities Alliance sat there quietly.<br/><br/>Seeing the arrival of the group of experts, he slowly opened his eyes.<br/><br/>“Alliance master, something big has happened to our hundred cities alliance. It seems that three more cities have been destroyed by the Dragon Palace. Many of our cities have fallen into panic. If we don’t handle it well, we will be finished!”<br/><br/>An old man couldn’t help but report to the Alliance Master of the Hundred Cities Alliance excitedly.<br/><br/>The Alliance Master of the Hundred Cities Alliance frowned and didn’t respond.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>The next moment, he suddenly moved his palm and a small city appeared in his hand. The model of the small city that was emitting vitality was dead silent.<br/><br/>“Another city has been destroyed?”<br/><br/>An expert saw the model of the city in the hands of the Alliance Master of the Hundred Cities Alliance and his face changed dramatically. He shouted in a low voice.<br/><br/>“Alliance master, the teleportation arrays of the nine-nine cities, nine-star Lianzhu city, and martial city have all been destroyed. Even the hidden teleportation arrays can not be used to teleport!”<br/><br/>At this moment, another five figures flew over.<br/><br/>The leader of the group was an old man with red eyes on his head.<br/><br/>“I’m afraid that the three cities have already been destroyed!”<br/><br/>They continued to speak with grave expressions.<br/><br/>“Something has happened in Star City as well. Give the order to open all the city arrays.”<br/><br/>The alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance had a solemn expression as he ordered, “All of you, enter a state of Alert!”<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>The expressions of the red-eyed experts changed slightly as they immediately replied.<br/><br/>This was the first time in the history of the Hundred Cities Alliance that all the city arrays had been opened and entered a state of alert.<br/><br/>A full-scale alert also meant that an all-out war had begun!<br/><br/>Their hundred cities alliance had actually been forced to such an extent.<br/><br/>However, they were also somewhat shocked and horrified.<br/><br/>The speed at which the nine-nine cities, nine-star Lianzhu City, and the others were destroyed was simply too fast!<br/><br/>It was so fast that no one could react in time. It was so fast that the destroyed cities did not have any distress signals.<br/><br/>It was as if they had evaporated in an instant. There was no sign of them, nor did they have any reaction.<br/><br/>“Alliance leader, once the entire alliance is on alert, the disciples of the Hundred Cities Alliance will be even more panicked. More people will leave our cities.”<br/><br/>An old man shouted with an embarrassed expression when he heard this order.<br/><br/>“Shut up. If the entire alliance is not on alert, we will be killed by the Dragon Palace. We don’t even know how we died.”<br/><br/>The alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance said with a gloomy face.<br/><br/>This time, the four great cities were destroyed in less than an hour, which was completely out of his expectations.<br/><br/>How did the Dragon Palace do it?<br/><br/>Even if they were universe masters with level-three power, they should not have destroyed four cities so quickly and so bizarrely!<br/><br/>There were four of them!<br/><br/>“I will investigate this matter thoroughly.”<br/><br/>The alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance said as he stood up.<br/><br/>His body moved and he flew up into the sky.<br/><br/>His body floated in the air as he slowly spread his arms and closed his eyes.<br/><br/>“Weng!”<br/><br/>Around him, the gigantic 108 mountains seemed to tremble.<br/><br/>The shadow of a mountain peak floated in the sky above him, and the shadows of innate spiritual treasures began to condense.<br/><br/>All the shadows flew toward him, shrank, and surged into his body.<br/><br/>He moved and disappeared in an instant.<br/><br/>At this moment, the Hundred Cities Alliance all moved.<br/><br/>The Hundred Cities Alliance was an alliance of more than one hundred cities.<br/><br/>However, there were only more than ninety members of the Hundred Cities Alliance now.<br/><br/>That was because nine cities had all been destroyed by the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>On this day, all the defensive formations of the cities were activated, and the formations covered all the cities.<br/><br/>At the same time, the formations cast a shadow over all the experts and disciples of the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>The Hundred Cities Alliance had been forced to such an extent.<br/><br/>“The… the formations of our cities have been activated for no reason. It must be confirmed that the cities of the nine-nine cities and the nine-star Lianzhu City have been destroyed!”<br/><br/>“Not only the nine-nine cities and the nine-star Lianzhu City of the martial city, but even the Star City was destroyed. In less than half a day, they were all destroyed!”<br/><br/>“It’s so terrifying. Four cities and such a short time. How did the Dragon Palace do it? Could it be that our city is next?”<br/><br/>“Compared to the Great Marquis City of the Eternal Heaven City, the four cities have all become dead cities. No one in the cities has escaped!”<br/><br/>The rise of the formation did not make the residents of the Hundred Cities Alliance feel safe. Instead, they were even more terrified!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
