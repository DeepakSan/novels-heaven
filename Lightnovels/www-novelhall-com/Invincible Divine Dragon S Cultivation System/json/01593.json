There are more than 3,000 powerhouses in the Heavenly Yuan creation realm and one in the same realm as the Dragon King. Now, the Dragon King says that he wants to use them to train the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace? Just leave it to them?”<br/><br/>“It’s impossible that the Dragon King and the others don’t know about the power of the witchcraft region. Even the Dragon Palace knows it better than us. Since the Dragon King says that it’s fine, the power of the Dragon Palace will definitely be able to destroy them. You should know that the Dragon King doesn’t fight battles that he’s not confident about.”<br/><br/>“Has the Dragon King’s strength increased tremendously again? Or perhaps, the Dragon Palace’s strength has increased tremendously?”<br/><br/>The experts of the Dragon Palace Alliance and the Justice Alliance couldn’t help but discuss.<br/><br/>They hesitated for a moment, looked at each other, and then rushed down to the land of origin.<br/><br/>They wanted to know how strong the Dragon Palace was now.<br/><br/>They wanted to know how powerful the current Dragon King was.<br/><br/>“Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum!”<br/><br/>“Hum! Hum! Hum!”<br/><br/>At the same time, at the bottom of the land of origin.<br/><br/>The experts of the sorcerer demon area were gathered in front of a special building, which was emitting a terrifying aura.<br/><br/>Dark energy was flowing on the building. At the top of the building, there were four enormous heads standing in four corners.<br/><br/>From the might that these four heads emitted, the owner of these four heads must have been a primal chaos level existence.<br/><br/>The witchcraft region had already made all the preparations to attack this region.<br/><br/>However, at this moment, suddenly, a wave of energy enveloped the surrounding space.<br/><br/>The gray energy formed an incomparably huge cage, enveloping the entire space.<br/><br/>It was as if it had separated this space and formed a single domain.<br/><br/>“Oh?”<br/><br/>The sudden change caused all the experts in the witchcraft region to be slightly stunned as they looked over in astonishment.<br/><br/>The witchcraft ancestor’s gaze focused as he stared at the energy that enveloped their space.<br/><br/>“What’s going on? Is this a formation? It’s enveloping us all within it?”<br/><br/>“The experts in this region have discovered our arrival? They want to use the formation to attack us?”<br/><br/>“Lord Witchcraft’s ancestor, should we immediately destroy this space?”<br/><br/>The experts in the witchcraft region frowned as they sized up this space and said.<br/><br/>“There’s no need!”<br/><br/>Witchcraft’s ancestor’s eyes flickered. “I can sense a powerful energy enveloping the surrounding space, enveloping us. In addition, the other party is here.”<br/><br/>“Trapping us here? Don’t tell me they want to have a duel with us here? hahaha!”<br/><br/>A chaos-level expert looked ahead, his eyes shining.<br/><br/>He could sense a group of experts flying toward them rapidly.<br/><br/>“I wonder who gave you the courage to invade our Dragon Palace. Die!”<br/><br/>“Keke, leave that chaos-level guy in the middle to me. I’m going to kill him.”<br/><br/>At this moment, the experts of the witchcraft region heard arrogant voices.<br/><br/>In their line of sight, there were also more than 3,000 heavenly yuan creator-level powerhouses flying toward them.<br/><br/>“Huh? What? Isn’t there only more than 1,000 heavenly yuan creator-level powerhouses in this area? Why are there so many of them now?”<br/><br/>The faces of the experts from the witchcraft region changed slightly when they saw the over three thousand heavenly Yuan creation realm experts charging over.<br/><br/>They swept their gazes over and discovered that the number of heavenly Yuan creation realm experts was the same as theirs.<br/><br/>This made them extremely astonished.<br/><br/>According to their investigations, there were only over a thousand heavenly yuan creation realm experts in this area.<br/><br/>If not, they wouldn’t have sent all their experts over to invade.<br/><br/>But now, the other party had appeared with an equal number of experts.<br/><br/>“The other party has an existence on the same realm as me. Damn it, attack. The strength of this region is very strong, not weaker than us. There are existences on the same realm as me here.”<br/><br/>At that moment, the ancestor of the witchcraft demon’s expression changed as well. A grave expression appeared on his face.<br/><br/>Suddenly, energy enveloped this space and trapped them.<br/><br/>Another group of experts suddenly charged over. He could sense that the expert at the front was an existence above chaos.<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>“Attack!”<br/><br/>Ancestor sorcerer Demon’s eyes were cold as he shouted. He locked onto the Nine Heavens Divine Roc and directly charged over.<br/><br/>The other experts from the sorcerer demon region also instantly erupted with intense killing intent.<br/><br/>They had all killed their way out of the Sea of corpses. Although this situation had appeared when they attacked this area, they did not have the slightest fear.<br/><br/>The violent energy attacked the group of powerhouses from the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace only had 900 heaven origin creation realm powerhouses.<br/><br/>The other heaven origin creation realm powerhouses were all Wang Xian’s clones.<br/><br/>Without Wang Xian, the strength of the Dragon Palace would be much weaker than the witchcraft region.<br/><br/>They might not even be a match for him.<br/><br/>In order to train the powerhouses from the Dragon Palace, they naturally had to fight him one-on-one.<br/><br/>As for the other experts, Wang Xian had to help them fend them off.<br/><br/>He had to use his doppelganger to help them fend them off.<br/><br/>“Kill! The second sons of the Dragon Palace! It’s been a long time since they had a big battle. Kill them!”<br/><br/>Mo Sha laughed maniacally in excitement. He locked onto the chaos-level expert and charged forward.<br/><br/>“Kill!”<br/><br/>Guan Shuqing and the other girls also made their move. They locked onto the chaos-level expert whose strength was similar to theirs.<br/><br/>The rest of the powerhouses from the Dragon Palace also locked onto their targets very quickly.<br/><br/>As for the Divine Roc of the Nine Heavens, he was staring at the ancestor of the Witch and Demon. The two of them were at the highest point in the sky and they collided instantly.<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>The Flames and demon flames churned and produced explosive sounds.<br/><br/>The battle erupted instantly.<br/><br/>The thirteen dragon children and Dragon Ladies locked onto their enemies respectively.<br/><br/>Wang Xian watched this scene with a faint smile on his face.<br/><br/>His identity was against more than two thousand other heaven origin blessed powerhouses.<br/><br/>It was very easy to deal with them because of the time domain.<br/><br/>After all, the Lord of calamity and the top-tier combat strength of the chaos level were locked onto by the Nine Heavens Divine Roc, Guan Shuqing, and the rest.<br/><br/>“Didn’t you say that there are only over a thousand heaven origin creation realm experts in this area? Old Demon, how did you investigate?”<br/><br/>The battle broke out, and both sides were in a more balanced situation.<br/><br/>“We don’t know!”An expert from the witchcraft region couldn’t help but shout.<br/><br/>“We don’t know either.”<br/><br/>The experts who were questioned replied. They didn’t know that there were so many experts in this area either.<br/><br/>If they knew, they wouldn’t have come to invade.<br/><br/>Because the distance was too far, once they died, their danger level would increase by a lot.<br/><br/>Now that such an enemy had suddenly appeared in this area, the possibility of them wanting to conquer it was almost zero.<br/><br/>This made them all look unusually embarrassed.<br/><br/>They didn’t get any benefits, but now they had to fight against the experts in a powerful area.<br/><br/>That’s not what they want, what they want.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
