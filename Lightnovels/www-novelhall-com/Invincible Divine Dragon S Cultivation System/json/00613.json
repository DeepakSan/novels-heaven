The other party does have some ability. Even in the undefeatable zone, he is a very powerful existence. Next, I will find at least another expert of your level.”<br/><br/>Seeing the Black Tower Magus’face full of battle intent, Angel Baili reminded him lightly!<br/><br/>“Hehe, finding two is enough. I will not join hands with others to attack an existence of the same level!”<br/><br/>The Black Tower Magus said indifferently!<br/><br/>“HM?”<br/><br/>His words caused the great angel Baili to frown slightly!<br/><br/>“I’m not afraid of anyone of the same level. Join Hands? Then my black tower might as well commit suicide!”<br/><br/>The Black Tower Magus looked at the Great Angel. “If you want to find an expert, don’t even think about saying that we will join hands. Of course, joining hands to kill an existence at the universe ruler realm is still possible!”<br/><br/>As he spoke, he couldn’t help but laugh!<br/><br/>His mouth was like a black hole. No teeth could be seen, and no tongue could be seen. It was really strange!<br/><br/>The Great Angel’s eyes flickered as he looked at him, and he was a little speechless in his heart!<br/><br/>These old fellows who hadn’t broken through all this time, over time, had become somewhat abnormal in their hearts!<br/><br/>“Good, other than the supreme water demon king, I’m looking for someone to deal with other ordinary universe rulers with rank 3 battle strength. Do you have any recommendations?”<br/><br/>Archangel Baili looked at the Black Tower Magus and continued asking!<br/><br/>“There’s an old scholar. He’s very strong, an expert from the saint lineage.”<br/><br/>The Black Tower Magus spoke!<br/><br/>“Then let’s set off now!”<br/><br/>Archangel Baili looked at him and spoke!<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>The Black Tower Magus nodded. With a wave of his arm, the fort behind him closed. With a flash, he brought Archangel Baili and flew off!<br/><br/>“HMM? Why is the Black Tower Magus following this archangel?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know. He must have something important to find the Black Tower Magus. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have come!”<br/><br/>“Could it be to deal with those space beasts? That shouldn’t be the case, right?”<br/><br/>In the surroundings, some experts watched their departing figures as they muttered to themselves!<br/><br/>The Black Tower Magus’prestige in this region was very high, and his strength was also unfathomable!<br/><br/>It could be seen from the fact that he occupied a towering Magus Tower!<br/><br/>The Black Tower Magus’battle record was extremely terrifying!<br/><br/>“Black Tower Magus, tell me about that old scholar’s strength!”<br/><br/>The Great Angel Baili flew beside the Black Tower Magus!<br/><br/>Even he had to use all his strength to keep up with the Black Tower Magus’speed. One could imagine how deep this old monster’s foundation was!<br/><br/>“Hehe, two experts from your angel race died at his hands. One of them seems to be called… forget it, his name is too long. There’s no need for him to leave his name behind after his death!”<br/><br/>The Black Tower Magus said indifferently!<br/><br/>When the Great Angel Baili heard his words, his brows raised.<br/><br/>However, at this moment, he suddenly thought of something, and his eyes flashed!<br/><br/>The two of them flew in the invincible region rapidly. After flying for more than a month, they arrived at a relatively bright region!<br/><br/>In front of them, there were many mountain peaks. The trees and grass on the mountain peaks were very lush!<br/><br/>This was a Cosmos God nation left behind by an expert after his death. It had been completely destroyed!<br/><br/>Those mountain peaks were left in a mess in this piece of void space!<br/><br/>Faintly, the sound of reading could be heard from the surroundings!<br/><br/>Among the mountain peaks of their group, there was a mountain peak that was emitting light energy.<br/><br/>The mountain peak looked very ordinary. One could vaguely see two old men sitting there, holding a fan in their hands, sitting in front of a chessboard!<br/><br/>They were just quietly sitting cross-legged. If one were to get close, one could see that the two old men looked exactly the same!<br/><br/>However, one of them had a kind look on his face, while the other had a fierce look on his face!1<br/><br/>This area was called the mountain of books, and this old man was called the old scholar!<br/><br/>He was a famous expert of the invincible region!<br/><br/>His battle record was because he had killed two experts of the angel race!<br/><br/>“Old scholar, the Archangel of the angel race has come to look for you for a matter. You can claim the reward!”<br/><br/>The Black Tower Magus flew over and shouted!<br/><br/>“Black Tower Magus, you’ve disrupted my chess game!”<br/><br/>When the old scholar heard the voice of the Black Tower Magus, the fierce-looking old man stared at him, his eyes filled with fury and killing intent!<br/><br/>“Hehe, what’s the matter?”<br/><br/>Opposite the fierce-looking old man, the kind-looking old man stood up. The fierce-looking old man strangely fused into his body and merged into one!<br/><br/>The kind-looking old man looked at Baili Archangel and smiled, fanning the fan in his hand!<br/><br/>However, when Baili Archangel saw the fan in his hand, he frowned slightly!<br/><br/>The feather on the fan was the feather of a Pinnacle Universe Knight of the Angel Race!<br/><br/>If this was not in the invincible region, the angel race would have sent people to kill him!<br/><br/>However, he killed a great being of the angel race in the invincible region, so the angel race would not bother with him!<br/><br/>This was the rule. Peak races weren’t so stingy!<br/><br/>“Help some high-level races and destroy a force. You’ll be the one who gets the reward. If our third prince can satisfy you, we’ll try our best to satisfy you!”<br/><br/>Baili Archangel said directly!<br/><br/>“I want books, books that I’ve never seen before. Useful Books left by universe overlords!”<br/><br/>Hearing this, the old scholar proposed the reward without any hesitation!<br/><br/>“Wait a moment!”<br/><br/>Angel Baili immediately sent this condition to the third prince, and soon, the condition was recovered!<br/><br/>“I can satisfy it!”<br/><br/>Soon, Angel Baili replied!<br/><br/>“Hehe, good, good. I believe that the third Prince of the Angel race will definitely have books that I Need!”<br/><br/>The old scholar laughed!<br/><br/>His request wasn’t simple.<br/><br/>The useful books left behind by masters at the Universe ruler realm weren’t that simple!<br/><br/>“Alright, after we meet up with the supreme water demon king, we’ll leave immediately!”<br/><br/>Archangel Baili said directly!<br/><br/>“Supreme Water Demon King? That warlike guy? In the outside world, which high-level high-level race needs the three of us to help? Is it a powerful force affiliated to that peak race?”<br/><br/>The old scholar raised his eyebrows and asked!<br/><br/>“No, the Dragon Palace, the last powerful force of the Dragon God lineage. They have two very powerful experts!”<br/><br/>The Great Angel Baili replied!<br/><br/>“The Dragon God lineage? The spoils of war belong to us. If we use the body of the Dragon God to create a dragon chair, TSK TSK, not bad!”<br/><br/>The old scholar waved the fan made of angel wings in his hand, his eyes shining!<br/><br/>“If you have the ability to kill the Dragon King alone, the corpse belongs to you!”<br/><br/>The Archangel Baili said directly!<br/><br/>The experts of the invincible region were very strong, but he also knew that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was not simple!<br/><br/>However, inviting the Black Tower Magus, the old scholar, and the water demon king should be enough!<br/><br/>These three were all famous experts in the invincible region!<br/><br/>There were very few who could compare to them in the invincible region!<br/><br/>The price of inviting them was too high. Even the third prince had to save as much as he could!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
