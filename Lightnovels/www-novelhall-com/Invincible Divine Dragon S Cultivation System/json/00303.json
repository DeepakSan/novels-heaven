The Righteous God race gave up on the landing battle?”<br/><br/>“It seems that the righteous God race provoked the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. In the end, the Dragon King killed a large number of their disciples. The Dragon Palace also has a universe Knight Level 7 great being, so they were afraid that the Dragon Palace would launch a sneak attack during the landing battle, so they gave up on the landing battle.”<br/><br/>There, the Giants of the primeval continent, a group of giants face excited look, they in the heart heavy sigh of relief.<br/><br/>The strength of the righteous race, in their eyes, is terrifying.<br/><br/>The Giants have a 30% chance of winning this battle.<br/><br/>Now that they’ve given up, it’s a huge blessing for them.<br/><br/>It could save them a lot of money.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Just as the Giants breathed a sigh of relief,.<br/><br/>Located in the ancient Sea Race of the continent, Wang Xian from the ancient sea race auction house out of the Treasury.<br/><br/>This time the harvest, for him is very good.<br/><br/>But then, there’s a lot of information coming from the cosmic brain.<br/><br/>When he saw the message, he was a little surprised.<br/><br/>“The Righteous God race actually gave up on disembarking?”<br/><br/>“They are now flying towards the Dragon Palace together with the ancient sea race. They are preparing to destroy the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>“Hahaha!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw these two messages, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud.<br/><br/>He really, really didn’t expect that the righteous God race would give up on the disembarking battle and join forces with the Ancient Sea Race to destroy the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Did they think that they could destroy the Dragon Palace?<br/><br/>“Aren’t they sending resources to our Dragon Palace? What a bunch of good people!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly.<br/><br/>Originally, he had already decided in his heart to destroy the ancient sea race. As for the Righteous God race, if they were to pay a price, Wang Xian wouldn’t make a move against them.<br/><br/>After all, those people were the only ones who provoked him.<br/><br/>With a good attitude, everything was negotiable.<br/><br/>However, he didn’t expect that the other party would be so crazy to destroy the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>He looked at some information on the universe’s AI, and a mocking expression appeared on his face.<br/><br/>The Righteous God race had suffered a huge loss this time, and they wanted to make up for this loss. The only way was to destroy the Dragon Palace and obtain all the Divine Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Obviously, they had the same idea.<br/><br/>“Since you are courting death and want to destroy our Dragon Palace from tens of thousands of light years away, we will naturally welcome you!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled. His figure moved slightly and disappeared immediately.<br/><br/>In the next moment, his figure appeared in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui sensed Wang Xian’s arrival and immediately came forward to welcome him.<br/><br/>“Someone has sent us a gift. We are prepared to welcome them and get all the members of the Dragon Palace Ready. We must treat them well and not let one of them escape.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to Prime Minister Gui with a smile.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King. This time, there are 17,000 to 18,000 universe knights from two different races. It is indeed a great gift for us.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui was full of smiles.<br/><br/>17,000 to 18,000 universe knights and all the accumulated gifts from the number one and number two forces in the surrounding Lu Xing Kong were a great joyous occasion for the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“I’ll send someone to prepare.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui said and immediately left.<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and nodded.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace was currently lacking some top-notch combat strength. After they arrived, they wouldn’t be lacking anymore.<br/><br/>He thought to himself and took out the universal AI to watch.<br/><br/>At this moment, on the universal AI, all the forces in the surrounding Lu galaxy were paying attention to the actions of the righteous God race and the Ancient Sea Race.<br/><br/>Everyone was guessing the outcome of this battle.<br/><br/>Countless people were discussing it.<br/><br/>However, many people still trusted the righteous God race and the ancient sea race very much.<br/><br/>They believed that they could defeat the Dragon Palace. As for completely destroying the Dragon Palace, they couldn’t be sure.<br/><br/>That was because the Dragon Palace of the divine dragon lineage was very strong<br/><br/>“This time, I’ll let you see the strength of the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the various guesses on the universe’s AI and smiled.<br/><br/>Not long after, a message came from the Water Dragon Palace asking if he wanted to help.<br/><br/>Wang Xian rejected it immediately.<br/><br/>There was no need for them to waste their time running over.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>At the same time, there were about 90 space hum beasts flying in the void of the surrounding starry sky.<br/><br/>Each of them was extremely huge. On their bodies, there were countless experts.<br/><br/>The Army of the Ancient Sea Race met the army of the Righteous God race.<br/><br/>This time, the true God race had mobilized all their forces for the landing battle.<br/><br/>Sou! Sou! Sou<br/><br/>On the Space Hum Beast led by the ancient sea race, eight figures flew toward the center of the Army of the true God race.<br/><br/>They glanced at the huge true God body and were full of confidence in this battle.<br/><br/>“Senior!”<br/><br/>The eight universe knights of the ancient sea race flew over and called out respectfully.<br/><br/>“From now on, all you have to do is follow the orders. This time, completely destroy the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>A golden light enveloped them and pulled them into the palace.<br/><br/>At this moment, 22 universe Knight Level 6 warriors were sitting on the left and right of the palace. The two elders of the Zheng God race were looking at them solemnly.<br/><br/>“It’s senior, we naturally believe in the strength of the Zheng God Race!”<br/><br/>The eight ancient sea race members immediately replied.<br/><br/>“Seniors, the Dragon Palace of the Dragon God lineage has a terrifying defense, if they hide inside, then we…”<br/><br/>The ancient sea race leader hesitated for a moment and said.<br/><br/>“There’s always a way, I really don’t believe that we can’t break through that Dragon Palace, HMPH!”<br/><br/>The two ancestors of the true God race said coldly.<br/><br/>This time, they would do everything they could to break the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Yes, with the righteous God race and our ancient sea race, we don’t believe that we can’t break the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>An elder of the Ancient Sea Race clenched his fist and roared in a low voice.<br/><br/>“Okay!”<br/><br/>The two elders of the righteous god race waved their hands coldly and said, “Go and prepare. The Eternal Dragon Palace won’t stop this time.”<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>The eight people cupped their hands and returned to the Space Hum Beast.<br/><br/>The two forces flew quickly.<br/><br/>According to their flying speed, it would take them one month to reach the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>However, they were not in a hurry. The Dragon Palace would not be able to escape.<br/><br/>They would destroy the Dragon Palace even if they had to flee to the ends of the Earth.<br/><br/>This time, the righteous God race was prepared to fight a protracted war. They could afford to waste hundreds of millions of years.<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. The news about the righteous god race, the Ancient Sea Race, was being updated every day.<br/><br/>One month was a lot of time.<br/><br/>The two races had also entered the starry sky of the galaxy. They were getting closer and closer to the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian was sitting in front of the Dragon Palace. There was a table placed in front of him.<br/><br/>A Bowl of tea was brewing on it.<br/><br/>“I’m finally here. It must have been tough for me to travel such a long distance!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked into the void and felt the immense power. A smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>He was getting anxious from waiting.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
