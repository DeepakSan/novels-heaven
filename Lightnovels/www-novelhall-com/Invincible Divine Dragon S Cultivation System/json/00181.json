After three years, we will wait for their specific news.”<br/><br/>The sect master of the ancient painting sect said with a frown.<br/><br/>“Three years? Why does the Sky Dragon Clan need three years? Are they helping us or not?”<br/><br/>The elder said.<br/><br/>“After three years, the Sky Sea Dragon Palace will open. Every time the Sky Sea Dragon Palace opens, it will be a feast for the water demons in the surrounding starry sky. The Sky Dragon Clan also rose because of the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>A white-haired old man pondered for a moment and continued, “The Sky Dragon Clan didn’t refuse. It means that they are very covetous of the Dragon Palace. After all, the Dragon Palace is weaker than them, but it has a pure-blooded divine dragon.”<br/><br/>“As for why they waited for the Sky Sea Dragon Palace to open, maybe they have their own plans.”<br/><br/>As he spoke, he looked at the sect master.<br/><br/>“We can still wait for three years.”<br/><br/>The sect master of the ancient painting sect nodded. “But we can’t do nothing during these three years. We can connect this place with the array formation. Three years is enough.”<br/><br/>“Yes, sect master.”<br/><br/>The venerables of the ancient painting sect nodded.<br/><br/>With their strength, they couldn’t do anything to the Dragon Palace. They could only wait and wait for the Heavenly Dragon Clan to help them.<br/><br/>Three years was just a snap of the fingers to them. They could afford to wait.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. In the Dragon Palace, a mighty aura came from the dragon transformation pool.<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>Sensing the majestic aura, Wang Xian and the leaders of the Dragon Palace flew over immediately.<br/><br/>In the sky above the dragon transformation pool, venerable willow deity was floating in the sky.<br/><br/>Her humanoid body seemed to be covered in a layer of willow clothing.<br/><br/>The entire willow clothing was over 10,000 meters long, and there were dragon scales on each willow.<br/><br/>Above her head, there was a gourd. The gourd was very small, only the size of a palm, and it seemed like an ornament.<br/><br/>“Willow deity Knight completed her transformation? Damn, what a powerful force, she’s comparable to a universe Knight Level 4 right now, right?”<br/><br/>A surprised voice came out of Mo Sha’s mouth. He looked at her in shock.<br/><br/>“The venerable Willow Deity’s realm has dropped. She is a level one universe knight, but she is able to fight three levels higher. She is comparable to a level four universe knight.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed the venerable willow deity’s strength and said with a smile.<br/><br/>“TSK TSK tsk, she is really powerful. She is not bad looking.”<br/><br/>Mo Sha said with a TSK TSK.<br/><br/>“Mo Sha, you can go and chase after him. By the way, our Dragon Palace has yet to give birth to a dragon seed. I think we can have a blind date in the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui was in a good mood as he joked.<br/><br/>“Hehe, I think Prime Minister Gui, you have to find a female turtle first.”<br/><br/>Mo Sha teased.<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled when he heard their words.<br/><br/>Indeed, the members of the Dragon Palace were currently joined by the outside world. When would the members of the Dragon Palace get married and give birth to a new dragon seed?<br/><br/>He was looking forward to it.<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Venerable Willow God finished his advancement and looked at Wang Xian. He immediately flew over and greeted him respectfully.<br/><br/>“HMM, get up. How is it?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at her with satisfaction and asked.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, although my realm is lower now, my strength is one step closer. I can kill a level four universe Knight!”<br/><br/>Venerable Willow God said confidently.<br/><br/>“Very good!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head in satisfaction.<br/><br/>He used dragon scales to replace the willow leaves and immortal slaying gourd.<br/><br/>The Venerable Willow God’s strength was already very terrifying.<br/><br/>“The other members of the Dragon Palace are almost at the same level.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked into the dragon transformation pool, his eyes shining.<br/><br/>In the next few days, the members of the Dragon Palace began to make breakthroughs.<br/><br/>Every day, waves of mighty power came from the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>This was a breakthrough that belonged to a universe knight.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace used to have 40 universe knights.<br/><br/>A month later, the number of universe knights in the Dragon Palace reached 80, doubling.<br/><br/>There were more than 20 corpses of universe knights and more than 100 corpses of peak void God Emperor powerhouses.<br/><br/>Along with the large amount of resources, the number of universe knights in the Dragon Palace had doubled.<br/><br/>The number of universe knights in the Dragon Palace had also increased by seven.<br/><br/>It was a pity that other than Wang Xian, the resources obtained this time could not increase the combat strength of the Dragon Palace by another level three universe knight.<br/><br/>However, the increase this time was terrifying enough.<br/><br/>After all, the addition and breakthrough of Venerable Willow God had raised the strength of the Dragon Palace to another level.<br/><br/>The improvement of the disciples of the Dragon Palace at the divine emperor level was even more terrifying.<br/><br/>In the entire skeleton clan, there were more than 30,000 strongest existences from the nine-sword clan and millions of elites from the bloodthirsty clan.<br/><br/>The dragon blood condensed from their corpses was too huge.<br/><br/>Even though the Dragon Palace had millions of members, it still made their improvement extremely terrifying.<br/><br/>The 10,000 Dragon Wizards from the Dragon Palace had used their huge resources to reach the level of a level 9 void God Emperor.<br/><br/>What did this mean?<br/><br/>10,000 dragon wizards controlling the heaven’s manifestation chessboard was comparable to 10,000 peak void God emperors.<br/><br/>Of course, just the increase of the dragon wizards consumed 70% of the resources.<br/><br/>Such an increase was also because of the heaven’s manifestation chessboard.<br/><br/>10,000 dragon shamans on the heaven’s manifestation chessboard could kill even 100 universe knights at Level One.<br/><br/>This was the reason why the Dragon Palace consumed 70% of the resources to increase their strength.<br/><br/>However, the remaining 30% of the resources allowed the other members of the Dragon Palace to increase their strength greatly.<br/><br/>Currently, the weakest member of the Dragon Palace was a level four void God Emperor.<br/><br/>In addition, the devouring dragon had devoured all the god kingdoms of the skeleton clan, and their strength had also increased greatly.<br/><br/>None of the devouring dragons had a combat strength lower than level three void God Emperor.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Devouring Dragon had added one universe knight level two and three universe knight level one great beings this time.<br/><br/>The increase this time was very huge for the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>One month later, all the members of the Dragon Palace gathered in the dragon field, each of them exuding a powerful aura.<br/><br/>“All the generals of the Dragon Palace pay their respects to the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>All the members of the Dragon Palace were also full of excitement, kneeling in front of them.<br/><br/>“Get up, the improvement of the Dragon Palace this time has also made us stand at the top of the Milky Way. From now on, all the disciples of the Dragon Palace will mainly hunt in the Milky Way, and the rest of the time, they will rest and play.”<br/><br/>“Enjoy the scenery of the universe and consolidate your strength.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian instructed with a smile on his face.<br/><br/>Ever since the Dragon Palace stepped into the center of the universe, they had not had a good rest and good contact with other people.<br/><br/>Next, Wang Xian was prepared to let the members of the Dragon Palace consolidate their strength.<br/><br/>He wanted the members of the Dragon Palace to enjoy the scenery in the Milky Way.<br/><br/>It could be considered a vacation.<br/><br/>A rare break.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
