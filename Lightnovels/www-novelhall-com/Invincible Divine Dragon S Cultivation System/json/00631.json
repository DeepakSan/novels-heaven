Down</h1><div class=\"entry-content\" id=\"htmlContent\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3622 3621, I’m Invincible, so you all die! Down<br/><br/>Ferocious and terrifying claws flew out from his chest. His body had undergone a terrifying transformation!<br/><br/>These claws were demonic claws!<br/><br/>The demonic claws had fused with the claws of the space beast and were transplanted into his body, possessing terrifying attacks!<br/><br/>The terrifying claws were so close to Jian Yun that he didn’t even have time to react!<br/><br/>He didn’t even try to block it. Instead, he took the initiative to meet it head-on!<br/><br/>The Tai Chi Dragon disc around his body slowly materialized and rotated!<br/><br/>The Black Tower Magus was still able to withstand this attack head-on!<br/><br/>“Hiss, hiss, hiss!”<br/><br/>The densely packed ferocious and terrifying claws made a strange sound. This was the strangeness of a Magus!<br/><br/>“Bang, Bang, Bang!”<br/><br/>However, when the claws landed on Wang Xian’s body!<br/><br/>He felt his speed slowing down slightly!<br/><br/>Following that, the densely packed claws seemed to have met with a great terror. The pitch-black claws actually began to shrivel slowly and began to break!<br/><br/>“Ah!”<br/><br/>The pain was transmitted to the Magus from the Black Tower. He couldn’t help but let out a blood-curdling scream!<br/><br/>His attacks were still unable to break through the defense of the Tai Chi Dragon Plate!<br/><br/>The backlash from the Tai Chi Dragon Plate was directed at him!<br/><br/>Invincible defense!<br/><br/>Invincible!<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled when he saw this scene. Unless there were three to four Black Tower Magi attacking him at the same time, he wouldn’t be able to break through the defense of the Tai Chi Dragon Plate. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to do it alone!<br/><br/>This was the terrifying aspect of the Tai Chi Dragon Disc!<br/><br/>“I’m Invincible, so you must die!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at him and said with a face full of mockery!<br/><br/>At such a distance, he instantly arrived in front of the Black Tower mages and raised his right arm!<br/><br/>On his right arm, the Divine Light Dragon of the Tai Chi Dragon disc coiled around him and threw a punch at him!<br/><br/>This punch was comparable to the power of a divine light dragon at the first stage of the Universe Dominator realm!<br/><br/>In short, it was the power of a dragon!<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>At such a close distance, the Black Tower Magus, who was already suffering from the backlash, did not have the slightest ability to resist!<br/><br/>His head exploded and turned into strange creatures that looked like bugs!<br/><br/>However, the attack was not over yet. The impact of the power of light was not over yet!<br/><br/>These strange Bugs died instantly!<br/><br/>The Black Tower Magi were killed instantly!<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian could still sense a transfer of energy!<br/><br/>This was a life-saving treasure!<br/><br/>He could only imagine it. For such a terrifying powerhouse from the invincible zone, he had to have some life-saving treasures!<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>“What!”<br/><br/>“How is this possible?”<br/><br/>At this moment, the Holy Dragon King, the Patriarch of the God-mu clan, and the rest of the people behind him saw this scene. Their faces were filled with astonishment!<br/><br/>What the hell was going on?<br/><br/>Awesome!<br/><br/>A Black Tower Magus who could break the Dragon Palace’s formation from a distance!<br/><br/>A top-tier expert of the invincible region!<br/><br/>He was killed by the Dragon King!<br/><br/>One move, just one move!<br/><br/>He flew over, and with one punch, he died!<br/><br/>In the middle, the Black Tower Magus tried to block twice, but was ignored by the Dragon King!<br/><br/>All of this was done in an instant!<br/><br/>And then, the confident Black Tower Magus had disappeared just like that!<br/><br/>Gone!<br/><br/>The difference was too great!<br/><br/>This was too terrifying!<br/><br/>“Impossible, impossible, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace can’t be this strong! This…”<br/><br/>The Sacred Dragon King and the others were on the verge of collapse, feeling a little terrified!<br/><br/>This was impossible!<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>On the side, the water demon king and the old scholar had yet to battle the Northern Frost Spirit Red Bone and the others!<br/><br/>They still wanted to see the Dragon King’s strength!<br/><br/>They did not need to see much to understand the situation!<br/><br/>But one move, and the Black Tower Magus was instantly killed?<br/><br/>The Black Tower Magus, even if the old scholar and the grand aquatic demon king had not called him over for a long time, they all knew that this was definitely a terrifying fellow!<br/><br/>If he had set up a formation beforehand, they would definitely not be a match for the Black Tower Magus, and might even be killed by him!<br/><br/>However, the Black Tower Magus could not withstand a single move from the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>“The first life is gone. There’s still the second!”<br/><br/>However, at this moment, Wang Xian’s voice rang out.<br/><br/>His body moved. Without any hesitation, he flew to the right. His speed was still extremely terrifying!<br/><br/>There, the figure of the Black Tower Magus appeared strangely!<br/><br/>His aura was not much different from before.<br/><br/>“No, how can your strength be so strong? How can the defense on your body be so strong?”<br/><br/>At this moment, when the Black Tower Wizard saw that Wang Xian was able to lock onto him in an instant, he revealed a shocked expression!<br/><br/>He stared at Wang Xian in horror.<br/><br/>How could this be?<br/><br/>He was a top-notch expert of the Invincible Zone!<br/><br/>He even dared to touch a real ruler of the universe!<br/><br/>What kind of monster was this Dragon King of the Dragon Palace?<br/><br/>“How many lives do you have?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at him and asked with a mocking tone!<br/><br/>He came to the front of the Black Tower’s wizard. The green pupils of the black tower’s wizard widened slowly. The entire green strange eye almost shot out!<br/><br/>“Flame of life, extinguish!”<br/><br/>His two green pupils really flew out. The green light was burning strangely!<br/><br/>This was the karmic fire of life!<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly as he looked at the attack unleashed by the Black Tower Wizard using the sacrifice of his two eyes!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>In front of him, the Taiji Dragon Disk was spinning. The Divine Light Dragon and the divine dark dragon were intertwined together!<br/><br/>A heavy aura was emitted from the Taiji Dragon Disk!<br/><br/>The two attacks from the Black Tower Wizard landed on the Taiji Dragon Disk!<br/><br/>Flames bloomed in an instant!<br/><br/>However, the tai chi dragon plate started to revolve. Light and darkness quickly extinguished the green flames!<br/><br/>The Flames started to become smaller and smaller!<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the scream of the Black Tower Wizard could be heard. The backlash began!<br/><br/>It was as if he had suffered a terrifying curse. His body started to collapse!<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked over and smiled. He flew over directly. This time, it was a light punch!<br/><br/>The Fist of annihilation!<br/><br/>The second life of the Black Tower’s Magus was gone in an instant!<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked surprised!<br/><br/>He still had the life-saving treasure!<br/><br/>“You really have quite a lot of life!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked in one direction. His body moved and he continued flying!<br/><br/>In that direction, the body of the Black Tower Magus condensed once again!<br/><br/>However, this time, he had already lost his eyes!<br/><br/>“Ah Ah Ah, Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, you killed me twice. I will curse you. I will curse you with my life. I will exchange my life for your life. You and I will fall into the cycle of reincarnation and be buried in the stars together. Twin Curse, I will die, you will die!”<br/><br/>The moment the Black Tower Magus appeared, his somewhat crazed voice was heard!<br/><br/>The curse spell was a curse spell that the Black Tower Magus was more proficient in!<br/><br/>The Dragon King had killed two of his lives and was tainted by Karma. He could curse!<br/><br/>“This… this…”<br/><br/>However, the Grand Aqua Demon King and the old scholar who saw this scene were completely shocked.<br/><br/>They were shocked by Wang Xian’s strength!<br/><br/>Similarly, they were also shocked by the Black Tower Wizard’s Curse!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
