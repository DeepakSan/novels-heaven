How could they suddenly be so terrifying? How could this happen?”<br/><br/>When over 200 rank seven gods were sent flying by the shockwave from Little Blue’s collision with the Starfield fragment.<br/><br/>In the next instant, they saw the ancient god kun-master attacking them again.<br/><br/>They knew about the ancient god kun-feeding Lord!<br/><br/>They knew about the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>They knew everything.<br/><br/>They even knew that the three kun-feeding lords of the ancient god kun -feeding Lord were extremely terrifying.<br/><br/>But this was only a space beast that was comparable to a level six ruler!<br/><br/>They could still fight and even kill it!<br/><br/>But Now? ? ?<br/><br/>Everything was out of their expectations!<br/><br/>The ancient god Feeding Kun master and a Kun suddenly broke through!<br/><br/>Was it that easy to break through?<br/><br/>If it was that easy, the level 6 ruler space beast they had tamed with the power of faith had also been nurtured into a level 7 ruler!<br/><br/>How could it be so easy to break through!<br/><br/>From the first level 6 ruler Kun being tamed by the palaces they believed in the universe, it wasn’t that these palaces didn’t want to make a breakthrough!<br/><br/>But it wasn’t that easy.<br/><br/>Especially since the cultivation systems of both sides were different.<br/><br/>Even if they had some energy that the space behemoths could absorb, it wasn’t as if they could break through just like that!<br/><br/>Until now, it would take at least a hundred million years for a sixth stage to break through to the seventh stage!<br/><br/>Even the nine origin universe was the same.<br/><br/>In the records, there weren’t any experts that said that they used just a few tens of millions of years to break through from the sixth stage to the Seventh Stage!<br/><br/>However, the ancient god Feeding Kun master had broken through!<br/><br/>This was completely beyond their expectations.<br/><br/>Sensing the power of the peak of the Pantheon realm that was attacking them, the 200 rank seven pantheon gods revealed terrified expressions.<br/><br/>This move could instantly kill all of them!<br/><br/>The Gap was too big!<br/><br/>They were only at rank seven, and there was still a huge gap between them and the peak of the Pantheon realm.<br/><br/>Even those with precious treasures would not be able to withstand it.<br/><br/>Over 200 Type 7 gods came from the strength of 2 palaces.<br/><br/>Each palace had a strength that was comparable to a Type 9 god.<br/><br/>With 2 Type 9 gods added together, there was still a huge gap between them and the peak gods! “Save us!”<br/><br/>“Quick, save us! ”<br/><br/>The 200-over Type 7 gods roared out at the 8 Type 7 gods who were controlling the starfield fragments!<br/><br/>Star River Guardian! ”<br/><br/>When the 8 Type 7 gods saw this, their expressions turned ugly. They gritted their teeth and sent out another wave of energy.<br/><br/>A Star River appeared in the surroundings, sweeping towards them.<br/><br/>The galaxy covered over 200 tier 7 gods!<br/><br/>“Save us!”<br/><br/>“Quick, save us!”<br/><br/>The eight tier 7 gods followed up with a loud roar!<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>The 200-plus tier 7 gods immediately flew towards the eight tier 7 gods with bloodshot eyes.<br/><br/>However, Lan Qingyue’s attack landed on the Galaxy Guardian!<br/><br/>As an attack that was comparable to a peak pantheon, the entire galaxy guardian trembled violently.<br/><br/>The more than 200 level seven gods in the center could not help but spit out mouthfuls of blood!<br/><br/>“Hehe, none of you will be able to escape today! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sneered and looked at Lan Qingyue. “Qingyue, you and Xiao Lan suppress those eight guys. Leave the rest to me, Xiao Bai, and the rest! ”<br/><br/>“Alright! ”<br/><br/>Lan qingyue nodded. In the next second, she appeared directly on Xiao Lan’s body!<br/><br/>Little blue directly charged at the Starfield fragment!<br/><br/>That terrifying power was not afraid of the Starfield fragment at all!<br/><br/>The Starfield fragment was very powerful, but it was only controlled by a Tier 7 pantheon.<br/><br/>If it was a high-level pantheon, it would be able to erupt with even more power!<br/><br/>But they were still too weak!<br/><br/>Lan Qingyue stood on Little Blue’s body, and with a wave of her arm, the surroundings instantly turned into a gray ocean!<br/><br/>Little Blue was in the gray ocean, making its power even more terrifying and vast!<br/><br/>“Oh no, we’re no match for them when they join forces! ”<br/><br/>“With the help of the star field fragment, we can only fight one peak-tier space beast at most. They’re already equivalent to two! ”<br/><br/>“Damn it, how can this be? How can the Dragon Palace be so strong? !”<br/><br/>A terrified voice came from the eight level seven pantheon gods. When they saw Xiao Lan and Lan Qingyue, who carried an invincible aura, their hearts pounded violently!<br/><br/>However, at this moment, they could no longer dodge. Gritting their teeth, they started to defend with all their might!<br/><br/>At the back, Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements Millstone attacked the more than two hundred level seven pantheon gods!<br/><br/>At the same time, the Taiji Dragon Disc transformed into a light and dark divine dragon and flew out from his surroundings to attack them! He stood on the soul warship and threw out the soul spear in his hand!<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>Two Soul Spears were thrown out one by one.<br/><br/>“woo! woo!”<br/><br/>“woo! woo!”<br/><br/>Xiao Zhai, Xiao Bai, and the rest let out a low growl and attacked the level-seven pantheon gods on the other side!<br/><br/>Back then, when Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue joined forces, they could deal with the army of ten palaces.<br/><br/>But now, they were only dealing with the strength of two palaces.<br/><br/>It was completely overwhelming!<br/><br/>They could even suppress them with just one of the five elements grinding.<br/><br/>Not to mention, they now had two to three times the strength of the Taiji Dragon Plate!<br/><br/>“The attack of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is Coming!”<br/><br/>“We can’t defend against it. The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is not someone we can deal with! ”<br/><br/>“It’s over, it’s over, it’s all over. How did it turn out like this! ”<br/><br/>When the two level seven pantheon of the palace saw Wang Xian charging over, despair appeared on their faces.<br/><br/>They never expected this outcome!<br/><br/>They never expected their opponent to be so terrifying!<br/><br/>More than 200 level seven pantheons saw Wang Xian, Xiao Bai, and the rest and unleashed their strongest attack in unison to resist!<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>However, the moment the energy collided, it began to collapse!<br/><br/>Waves of terrifying five elements and yin-yang energy surged into their bodies, depleting their vitality!<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood on the soul warship and charged straight at the level seven pantheons!<br/><br/>The Soul Spears easily penetrated the bodies of the level seven pantheon.<br/><br/>One soul spear easily penetrated more than ten level seven pantheon and killed them instantly.<br/><br/>Two soul spears and nearly thirty level seven pantheon were killed instantly!<br/><br/>It was a complete instant kill!<br/><br/>Similarly, under the attack of the five elements grinding mill and the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, more than a hundred level seven pantheon died instantly.<br/><br/>Beside them, little white and little house also instantly killed dozens of rank seven pantheon gods.<br/><br/>In an instant, more than 200 rank seven pantheon gods knew that there were only 30 to 40 left!<br/><br/>The Gap, the huge gap!<br/><br/>This was a battle on a completely different level!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
