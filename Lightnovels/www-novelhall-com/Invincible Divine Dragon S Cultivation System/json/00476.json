Hahaha, how dare that reckless guy destroy the members of the Alliance of the Hundred Cities?”<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace is still too weak. They challenged the alliance of the Hundred Cities, and the Alliance of the hundred cities sent out experts to suppress them!”<br/><br/>“The alliance of the Hundred Cities has announced that although they have suppressed the Dragon Palace, most of the members of the Dragon Palace have already escaped. However, the alliance of the Hundred Cities will kill all the members of the Dragon Palace in the future!”<br/><br/>“They are too powerful. The Dragon Palace has no power to resist at all. It has been suppressed directly!”<br/><br/>After the experts of the Hundred Cities Alliance returned, they immediately spread the news that the dragon palace had been suppressed.<br/><br/>They released this news for two reasons.<br/><br/>One was to show the strength of the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>The other was to prepare for the next time when the Hundred Cities Alliance hunted the disciples of the Divine Dragon Clan.<br/><br/>In the future, as long as the Hundred Cities Alliance did not hunt the strong disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage, they could blame the members of the Dragon Palace for their targets.<br/><br/>On the universe’s AI, the strong practitioners and disciples of the other forces did not know the intention of the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>The disciples of the Hundred Cities Alliance cheered and shouted that the Dragon Palace was courting death.<br/><br/>The other forces were also slightly shocked by the strength of the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>After all, it was an alliance formed by a hundred cities. Its strength was extremely terrifying.<br/><br/>“Hehe!”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian was in the grotto-heaven paradise under the water in the Heavenly River.<br/><br/>He looked at the information on the universe’s AI and revealed a cold smile.<br/><br/>Although the Dragon Palace was suppressed this time, it didn’t affect them in the slightest.<br/><br/>On the contrary, A Level 2 universe dominator of the Hundred Cities Alliance died from the backlash after killing the cursed dragon.<br/><br/>Now, the so-called suppression of the Hundred City Alliance was a good cover for the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, This Hundred City Alliance is too arrogant. They gave an order to kill any disciple of the Dragon Palace in the future.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Turtle was furious when he saw the message on the AI.<br/><br/>It had been a long time since they had encountered such an arrogant enemy!<br/><br/>“They are indeed a little arrogant. Do they really think that they can easily deal with us?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian revealed a mocking and mocking expression.<br/><br/>This time, the Hundred Cities Alliance had come to suppress the Dragon Palace. If Wang Xian were to retaliate, it would be impossible for them to suppress the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>However, if he were to retaliate, the other party would send more experts.<br/><br/>There was no need to do so!<br/><br/>There was also no need to reveal his strength.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, now that the demonic eight Qi has improved, with their strength, if they are lucky, they will be able to control a city within a year. If they are unlucky, they will need at most a few years. At that time, we will make the Hundred Cities Alliance pay a terrible price!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui said with a face full of killing intent.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded. “Order all the disciples of the Dragon Palace outside to be extremely careful. They must be on guard against all living creatures.”<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui nodded.<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>At this moment, a message came from Wang Xian’s universal AI. It was a message from the Green Dragon Moon.<br/><br/>It was a message asking about the situation of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Wang Xian replied a little so that he didn’t have to worry.<br/><br/>“Brother Wang Xian, be careful. According to the information we received, all the cities of the Hundred Cities Alliance have sent out a part of their elites to form a small team of members from the dragon exterminating palace. You must be extremely careful.”<br/><br/>“According to our guess, they will hunt down those with the Divine Dragon bloodline wantonly.”<br/><br/>Azure Dragon Moon sent another message.<br/><br/>Upon seeing this message, Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly.<br/><br/>“Brother Green Dragon Moon, do you mean that the other party will attack all the people with the Divine Dragon Bloodline?”<br/><br/>He replied directly.<br/><br/>“It should be. According to the information obtained by the experts of our ancestral dragon lineage, the Hundred Cities Alliance seems to be involved. However, they will not attack the disciples and members of the ancestral dragon lineage on the surface at the moment. You guys have to be careful,”Green Dragon Moon replied quickly.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at Azure Dragon Moon’s information and his eyes flickered.<br/><br/>The Hundred Cities Alliance didn’t dare to participate in the whole process, but they had already taken action in the dark.<br/><br/>Furthermore, they had organized a small team to hunt down the members of the Dragon Palace. This team claimed to be hunting down the disciples of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>In fact, they were hunting down all the experts of the divine dragon lineage.<br/><br/>As long as the other party was not recognized by the public as the experts and disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage, they could blame it on the disciples of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The ancestral dragon lineage had been scattered for tens of millions of years, and many new experts with the Divine Dragon bloodline were born. Many experts did not know whether they were experts of the ancestral dragon lineage or not.<br/><br/>In that case, the Hundred Cities Alliance could be said to have killed a disciple of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the experts of the ancestral dragon lineage had obviously encountered some trouble, so they did not want to completely fall out with the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>“The team that hunted the disciples of the Dragon Palace. This Hundred Cities Alliance is really arrogant.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a sinister look.<br/><br/>“Hundred Cities Alliance, you will have to pay the price very soon!”<br/><br/>He muttered as he sat cross-legged in the grotto-heaven blessed land, quietly waiting for the news from the eight-limbed demonic fiend.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was not in a hurry. He could afford to wait. Furthermore, the waiting time would not be too long.<br/><br/>It would only be a few years at most!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, the latest news is that more than a dozen disciples of our Dragon Palace have been killed in a small city called heavenly city. More than half of the small city has been destroyed and there are many casualties.”<br/><br/>However, two months later, a sudden piece of news disrupted Wang Xian’s plan.<br/><br/>When he heard the news reported by Prime Minister Gui, he was slightly stunned!<br/><br/>“The Hundred Cities Alliance acted very quickly. In addition, the Hundred Cities Alliance seems to have issued a statement and warning in this manner. They want the other neutral cities and races to forbid the disciples of the Dragon Palace from entering the city. Otherwise, they will bear the consequences.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui continued.<br/><br/>“Prime Minister Gui, you said that city is called Heavenly City?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly as he spoke.<br/><br/>“Yes, it’s called Heavenly City. It’s a small city and there aren’t many strong people in it. The Hundred Cities Alliance sent out an apology and said that they would compensate them. However, this is clearly a warning to the other cities.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui nodded his head.<br/><br/>“Heavenly City?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s expression slowly turned ugly. He immediately took out his artificial intelligence and contacted someone.<br/><br/>Scholar Fang!<br/><br/>The first group of people he met when he came to the inner parts of the heaven-splitting primordial land were people from heavenly city.<br/><br/>At that time, he had a long chat with scholar Fang, a strong person from the saint’s branch of heavenly city. The other party even gave him some calligraphy and painting gifts.<br/><br/>The two of them chatted happily and learned a lot from him.<br/><br/>However, more than half of heavenly city had been destroyed?<br/><br/>This made Wang Xian’s eyes reveal a cold killing intent.<br/><br/>After the message was sent, time passed by minute by minute. There was no reply.<br/><br/>Wang Xian closed his eyes slightly and waited. One day, two days, three days…<br/><br/>Ten days later, there was still no reply.<br/><br/>“Prime Minister Gui, send someone to heavenly city to investigate a person called scholar Fang.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian instructed calmly. His figure moved and he flew out of the grotto-heaven blessed land. He immediately contacted the eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest.<br/><br/>He could not wait any longer!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
