A Space City built by 13 pinnacle races, this? ? ?<br/><br/>We can enter as we please?”<br/><br/>“Isn’t this too majestic and powerful? This space city was built to deal with the belief universe?”<br/><br/>“Hahaha, that’s great. In the future, when we enter this space city, it can be said to be 100% safe. This is a space city built by 13 peak races! ”<br/><br/>“The space city is still secondary. This time, the 12 peak races have joined hands to form a powerful battle team, preparing to fight against the belief universe! ”<br/><br/>“The first time our space universe won against the belief universe. Although we failed the last time, our counterattack has already begun this time. We will definitely succeed! ”<br/><br/>“That’s right. Eh, why didn’t the Dragon Palace participate?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know. Maybe the Dragon Palace is still a little weak. There is still a huge gap in top-tier combat power. ”<br/><br/>On the communication stone plate, countless great beings ‘disciples were discussing excitedly.<br/><br/>Not long ago, the nine-origin universe suffered a great defeat.<br/><br/>The precious lands belonging to the Great Beings ‘disciples of the nine-origin universe suffered attacks from the great beings of the belief universe.<br/><br/>A large number of great beings of the 9-origin universe had died tragically.<br/><br/>Although the great beings of the high-level races had suffered fewer attacks, they had always been terrified.<br/><br/>Now that they had this space city, they also had a safe place to rest.<br/><br/>And now, the counterattack of the Great Beings of the pinnacle races of the 9-origin universe had begun!<br/><br/>It didn’t take long for a large number of great beings ‘disciples to enter the Space City.<br/><br/>When they entered the city, their faces were filled with shock.<br/><br/>The Great Beings ‘disciples from the 9-origin universe had a safe place, and the counterattack of the 12 pinnacle races had begun.<br/><br/>The 12 pinnacle races joined hands to form a total of five battle teams to hunt<br/><br/>down the army of the belief universe.<br/><br/>It was impossible for the 10 or so armies of the belief universe to all gather<br/><br/>together. At the beginning, the five battle teams had achieved some results.<br/><br/>However, this effect was not very great.<br/><br/>After all, the Great Beings sent by the belief universe this time were too terrifying!<br/><br/>The Pinnacle Races of the 9-origin universe also understood that the power of the belief universe was too terrifying!<br/><br/>Therefore, they only needed to waste time with it.<br/><br/>It was a waste of time for the 10 or so legions of the belief universe to waste time with them.<br/><br/>If they withdrew a portion of the legions, the 9-origin universe could also counterattack!<br/><br/>The belief universe also understood this problem. After learning that the 9-source universe had built a huge city, they wanted to attack the huge city.<br/><br/>However, they didn’t have 100% confidence.<br/><br/>Therefore, they didn’t take action for the time being.<br/><br/>The war was at a stalemate again.<br/><br/>The 5 battle teams of the 9-source universe were fighting a guerilla war with the army of the belief universe.<br/><br/>Although the belief universe was strong, they didn’t dare to attack the 9-source universe’s huge city.<br/><br/>After all, if the nine-origin universe took out a treasure of the level of the Tianyuan destiny fragment, the belief universe might suffer heavy losses.<br/><br/>Time passed quickly in this stalemate.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was in that domain. Halfway through, he sensed a large amount of information about the experts of the belief universe. He left immediately and was not found!<br/><br/>More than ten million years passed quickly.<br/><br/>On this day, Wang Xian finally received some good news. When he received this news, he could not help but smile!<br/><br/>Xiao Lan had a breakthrough!<br/><br/>Xiao Lan’s breakthrough brought with it the power of feedback. It allowed Lan Qingyue to achieve a breakthrough.<br/><br/>The seventh level of the Universe Dominator!<br/><br/>Although Xiao Zhai and Xiao Bai had yet to achieve a breakthrough, Xiao Lan’s breakthrough was already sufficient!<br/><br/>“I’ve finally achieved a breakthrough. After the breakthrough, I can have a good fight with the gods who believe in the universe. I can even destroy all of them!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes shone with excitement.<br/><br/>The power of the galactic fragment was at most comparable to the peak of the ruler realm.<br/><br/>Now that Xiao Lan and Lan Qingyue had achieved a breakthrough, the power of the two peak of the ruler realm was sufficient to defeat them and even destroy them!<br/><br/>Wang Xian immediately contacted an lie and ordered him to bring Lan Qingyue and the rest over!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>A few minutes later, Xiao Lan and Lan Qingyue appeared beside Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Xiao Xian! ”<br/><br/>Lan Qingyue looked at Wang Xian with a smile on her face!<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled at her and nodded his head heavily. “Let’s find the gods in the starry universe first. Once we find them, we will attack and destroy them completely. ”<br/><br/>“Alright! ”<br/><br/>Lan qingyue nodded her head. “With Xiao Lan’s strength, she is able to fight against the fragment of the Starfield. I can easily kill the other gods as well. If I join forces with Xiao Lan, we will be able to defeat them.”<br/><br/>“Alright, that’s Enough! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head.<br/><br/>He let Xiao Lan and the rest hide for now. Wang Xian released his dragon might and flew forward.<br/><br/>If he were to search here wantonly, it wouldn’t be long before he would meet the group of gods who believed in the universe.<br/><br/>Just as Xiao Lan made a breakthrough and Wang Xian was about to make a move on the gods in the universe of belief, the army in the universe of belief and the universe of stars also carried out a plan!<br/><br/>The universe of belief was about to launch another attack on the nine-origin universe!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
