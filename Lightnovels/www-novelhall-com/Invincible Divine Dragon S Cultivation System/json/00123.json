Countless bolts of thunder struck towards the chains.<br/><br/>“Holy light illumination!”<br/><br/>The battle Angel’s wings flapped, and beams of light power attached to the dragon eye chains.<br/><br/>The Dragon Eye Lock contained the power of light.<br/><br/>Now that the light covered the chains, it added a powerful defense.<br/><br/>Countless bolts of lightning landed on the chains, but they were canceled out by the power of light.<br/><br/>The chains continued to cover the surroundings.<br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/>The wings on the back of the dragon-faced venerable were flashing with Thunderbolts. At this moment, he no longer paid attention to the Thunder Dragon Bone and flew backward instantly.<br/><br/>“I told you, you can’t escape. Since you’re here, you should stay here!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian roared coldly. He pushed his speed to the limit and arrived in front of the dragon-faced Venerable in an instant.<br/><br/>Eight luminaries dragon scale!<br/><br/>His entire body was emitting an eight-colored glow. With a wave of his dragon claws, he charged straight at the venerable dragon-faced man.<br/><br/>It was all about strength and defense.<br/><br/>With Wang Xian’s strength, he didn’t have the advantage in terms of strength and defense. His advantage was his speed. He was the battle Angel at the back.<br/><br/>Therefore, he didn’t want to injure his opponent. As long as the Dragon Eye chain surrounded him in a space, he would be dead soon.<br/><br/>“Get lost!”<br/><br/>The eyes of the venerable dragon-faced man turned blood-red. He raised the Thunder Hammer in his hand and smashed it at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s dragon claws glowed as they collided with the Thunder Hammer.<br/><br/>A terrifying energy formed around their bodies. Wang Xian and the venerable dragon-faced man flew backward.<br/><br/>“Very good!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled when he saw this scene.<br/><br/>Crash<br/><br/>Countless chains completely sealed the venerable dragon-faced man in the surrounding area.<br/><br/>Wang Xian flapped his wings and the surrounding space began to collapse. He instantly entered the area covered by the chains.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang<br/><br/>The moment he entered, he saw the Battle Angel completely entangling the venerable dragon-faced man.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked over and his face lit up with joy. He revealed a mocking expression, “Venerable dragon-faced man, weren’t you waiting here to kill me? Why are you running away now?”<br/><br/>The venerable dragon-faced man blocked the attack of the Battle Angel. His breathing stopped when he heard Wang Xian’s words.<br/><br/>Swoosh<br/><br/>Wang Xian didn’t give him any chance to catch his breath. He moved his body and headed straight for the attack.<br/><br/>“His speed is too strange. I have to think of a way to escape. Otherwise, I will be seriously injured!”<br/><br/>When the venerable dragon-faced man saw Wang Xian appearing behind him in an instant, his pupils constricted slightly.<br/><br/>He was very clear about the current situation. If he continued to fight, he would definitely be severely injured.<br/><br/>“World of thunder, protect yourself!”<br/><br/>The venerable dragon-faced man let out a low roar. The World of thunder, which was like a disc, landed on his head.<br/><br/>A thunder robe draped over his body, causing him to withstand Wang Xian’s attack. He couldn’t help but spit out blood.<br/><br/>“Law manifestation, thunder clouds!”<br/><br/>He roared wildly. In the sky above him, a thunder cloud slowly condensed.<br/><br/>The Thunder Cloud covered an area of more than 1,000 kilometers and contained a mighty might.<br/><br/>Bolts of lightning descended from the Thunder Cloud and attacked Wang Xian and the battle angel continuously.<br/><br/>The Thunder Cloud had the ability to lock onto the target. The continuous attacks were abnormally terrifying.<br/><br/>Law Form!<br/><br/>A terrifying attack that could be comprehended by a universe knight.<br/><br/>The law form could almost be said to be remaking the world.<br/><br/>Unlike the illusionary laws and techniques, the thing condensed by the law form was a real object.<br/><br/>Only by destroying the law form would it stop attacking.<br/><br/>“You want to keep me here, what wishful thinking. This time I won’t be able to kill you, but next time, my dragon race will definitely kill you!”<br/><br/>The dragon-faced venerable stood below the Thunderclouds and roared with a ferocious expression.<br/><br/>The demi-dragon beast bone on his back burst out with terrifying lightning rays and attacked Wang Xian’s Battle Angel.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a dragon’s Roar and a miserable scream came from the side.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked to the side. When he saw the five elements millstone was in the sky above the Thunder Dragon Bone and the Five Divine Dragons were absorbing the dragon blood in its body, a smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>The five elements millstone had the ability to suppress a level one universe knight. Furthermore, it contained five of his true dragon clones.<br/><br/>The Thunder Dragon Bone was a sub-dragon after all.<br/><br/>It had a suppressive power in terms of bloodline.<br/><br/>Within a short period of time, the Thunder Dragon Bone was completely suppressed.<br/><br/>“How is this possible? What treasure is this?”<br/><br/>An unbelievable voice came from the dragon-faced knight in front of him. He widened his eyes and was filled with shock.<br/><br/>Even if an ordinary acquired spiritual treasure possessed spirituality, this was the first time he had seen such a battle with such terrifying combat strength.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Lightning Dragon Bone that was similar to his was suppressed in such a short period of time. This was too terrifying.<br/><br/>“Hahaha!”<br/><br/>“Five Elements Millstone, kill!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian laughed out loud. With a wave of his arm, the five elements millstone flew towards him directly.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>It emitted a terrifying force of the five elements and blasted towards the thunderclouds in the sky.<br/><br/>The moment the five elements millstone flew towards the thunderclouds, Wang Xian and the battle angel also moved and locked onto the dragon-faced venerable.<br/><br/>“This is bad!”<br/><br/>A trace of cold sweat appeared on the forehead of the dragon-faced venerable. His heart pounded violently.<br/><br/>If he had the confidence to escape just now, coupled with the terrifying treasure, he felt an intense threat.<br/><br/>This threat might cause him to perish.<br/><br/>“Fight for your life, Run!”<br/><br/>Without any hesitation, he threw the acquired spiritual treasure, the world of Heavenly Thunder, directly at Wang Xian and the rest.<br/><br/>The world of Heavenly Thunder, which was bursting with terrifying power, formed a huge net.<br/><br/>“Can I escape?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian focused his gaze. The chains that enveloped the surroundings were shrinking rapidly. He grabbed the two chains below with both hands. Streams of energy were injected into them and he controlled the chain of dragon eyes to attack.<br/><br/>At the same time, he commanded the Battle Angel to fight against the world of thunder that was flying towards him.<br/><br/>“Break, break, Break!”<br/><br/>The venerable dragon-faced man raised the Thunder Hammer in his hand and smashed it towards the chains. His eyes were filled with blood.<br/><br/>He was going all out!<br/><br/>The chains crumbled rapidly but quickly gathered together. The venerable dragon-faced man held the Thunder Hammer with both his hands and channeled all the power of thunder into it.<br/><br/>“Rumble!”<br/><br/>However, at this time, the Thunder clouds in the sky slowly collapsed under the great grinding of the five elements.<br/><br/>He raised his head and his face turned pale!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
