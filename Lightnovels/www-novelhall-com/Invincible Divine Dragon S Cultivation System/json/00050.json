At most, it had an area of a thousand kilometers.<br/><br/>A thousand kilometers was very short for an elite warrior.<br/><br/>The entire island was covered by incomparably luxuriant branches. From the sky above the island, one could see from afar that it was emitting a white immortal aura.<br/><br/>From the outside, one could not see the situation inside the island.<br/><br/>This was the Divine Willow Daoist Rite Temple, a seemingly ordinary place.<br/><br/>However, this place was the Holy Land for many cultivators.<br/><br/>The Divine Willow Daoist rite temple recruited disciples once every thousand years. However, very few people could enter this place.<br/><br/>There might not even be one in a thousand years.<br/><br/>“It is said that those branches are a part of the venerable willow deity’s body. I don’t know if they are real or fake!”<br/><br/>Mi Xin Lu looked at the branches on the island in front of him and said.<br/><br/>“Let’s go.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved and immediately flew towards the direction of the Willow deity Daoist sect.<br/><br/>“Brother Wang, there is still a year before the venerable Willow Deity’s once-in-a-thousand-years assessment. Isn’t it a little early for us to arrive?”<br/><br/>“Moreover, we are not disciples of the willow deity Daoist sect now. We can’t enter.”<br/><br/>Mi Xin Lu saw him flying forward and reminded him.<br/><br/>“I know. I have something that can enter directly.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head and continued to approach the willow deity Daoist sect.<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>When he was only a hundred kilometers away from the willow deity Daoist sect, a long branch with a terrifying aura was pointing at him.<br/><br/>Once he entered again, this branch might launch an attack.<br/><br/>“What a powerful force.”<br/><br/>Sensing the terrifying power from that branch, Wang Xian’s pupils contracted slightly.<br/><br/>This branch could kill him directly.<br/><br/>One had to know that even a powerhouse at the peak of the divine emperor realm could not kill him.<br/><br/>Now, this branch was a threat to his death.<br/><br/>As expected of a top-notch powerhouse in the Milky Way.<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself. With a wave of his arm, he immediately took out the branch that Ming Xuanzhi had given him.<br/><br/>The branch emitted a lustrous glow, similar to the aura of the branch in front of him.<br/><br/>“Willow Heart Branch!”<br/><br/>“Those who possess the Willow Heart branch can enter the willow deity Daoist sect directly after testing their temperament!”<br/><br/>A voice sounded out of thin air. Following closely behind the branch in front of him, the voice came over.<br/><br/>The branch swept over and connected the Willow Heart Branch together.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>At the same time, a surge of energy filled with vitality landed on Wang Xian’s head.<br/><br/>Sensing that the energy did not cause any harm, Wang Xian did not resist.<br/><br/>“Pass the test. State your name.”<br/><br/>The energy disappeared quickly and another voice came from the branch.<br/><br/>This surprised Wang Xian a little. This test was too fast.<br/><br/>“Greetings, Venerable Willow Deity, student Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian cupped his hands and bowed.<br/><br/>“Those who enter the willow deity Daoist sect are not separated from me as master and disciple. Since you are so lucky, you just have to abide by the rules of the Willow deity Daoist sect.”<br/><br/>The branch said to him.<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded.<br/><br/>As expected, just like what the universe’s artificial intelligence said, entering the willow deity Daoist sect had nothing to do with venerable willow deity.<br/><br/>Venerable Willow deity would not protect you in other places, nor would he accept disciples.<br/><br/>Many people in the AI could not figure out the reason. They could not figure out why the venerable willow deity was like this.<br/><br/>Perhaps, he was simply nurturing some strong practitioners.<br/><br/>“I am here to bring you into the Divine Willow Daoist rite temple. The little girl beside you is prohibited from entering the inner part of the Daoist Rite Temple. She can only stay in the outer area.”<br/><br/>As the branch spoke, it enlarged and came under Wang Xian. It dragged him and flew inside.<br/><br/>As for Mi Xin Lu, he was sent directly to the island of the Willow deity Daoist sect.<br/><br/>“This…”<br/><br/>When Mi Xin Lu saw that Wang Xian had become a disciple of the willow deity Daoist sect, her eyes revealed a look of shock.<br/><br/>Following that, her face was filled with joy.<br/><br/>After becoming a disciple of the willow deity Daoist sect, she would be protected by the willow deity Daoist sect. No matter what dangers she encountered, she would be fine as long as she hid here.<br/><br/>And every disciple of the willow deity Daoist sect could bring five dao children. Although Dao children could not enter the core, they could live in the outer area.<br/><br/>The outer area was also protected by the Willow deity Daoist sect.<br/><br/>Even if she revealed her true form here, there wouldn’t be any danger.<br/><br/>Of course, it might not be the case once she left this place.<br/><br/>“Everyone who enters our willow deity Daoist sect will be able to obtain one treasure. There are three treasures in front of you, you can choose one!”<br/><br/>The branch brought Wang Xian towards the center of the island.<br/><br/>At this moment, the branch opened its mouth to speak. There were three treasures floating in front of him.<br/><br/>One was a leaf, which contained a powerful energy.<br/><br/>The second was a drop of crystal clear liquid, which contained a powerful life force and energy.<br/><br/>The third was a one-meter-long branch, which also contained a powerful energy. However, this branch seemed to be made of material.<br/><br/>“This willow leaf can break any restriction below the level of a universe knight and allow you to return to the Willow deity Daoist sect in an instant.”<br/><br/>“Flowing heart liquid can strengthen the divine kingdom and increase the recovery ability of life.”<br/><br/>“One of my branches can be made into a fishing rod. It can not be broken by anyone other than a universe knight.”<br/><br/>Following that, the branch introduced three items to him.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard the introduction, his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>This willow deity from the willow deity Daoist sect was really generous.<br/><br/>The first life-saving treasure and the second one could increase one’s strength. It seemed that the third one might not be of much use. It was just a powerful material.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian’s gaze landed on that branch.<br/><br/>The fallen leaves were completely useless to him on the way back. The flowing heart liquid could increase the dragon qi. However, the value of this flowing heart liquid was at most comparable to a divine herb at the peak of the Celestial Emperor Realm.<br/><br/>On the contrary, this branch was of great interest to him, especially after he learned about fishing.<br/><br/>“I choose this branch.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian immediately said.<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>The other two treasures disappeared, leaving only a branch.<br/><br/>“Thank you, Venerable Willow Deity, for the treasure!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian cupped his hands and immediately kept the branch.<br/><br/>Crash<br/><br/>At this moment, he came to the sky that was covered by willow branches. When he arrived, the willow branches below automatically spread out.<br/><br/>Below him, there were many houses that were formed by willow branches.<br/><br/>“There’s a new member of the Willow deity Daoist sect, Wang Xian.”<br/><br/>The voice from the branches spread down. Some people walked out from the rooms one after another. They were surprised and curious.<br/><br/>“Hasn’t the once-in-a-thousand-year assessment not started yet? Why are there people coming in?”<br/><br/>“Which race are they from? Are they humans or other living beings?”<br/><br/>In the rooms, young and middle-aged men walked out one after another. They looked up at the sky with curiosity.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked over and sensed the strength of most of them.<br/><br/>There were people from the first level to the ninth level of the celestial thearch.<br/><br/>There were more than three thousand of them. There were humans as well as creatures from other races. They were only in the form of humans for the time being.<br/><br/>They looked at Wang Xian curiously. Wang Xian was also sizing them up curiously.<br/><br/>“Greetings, everyone!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian cupped his hands. When he sensed the disappearance of the branches under him, he immediately flew down.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
