Go<br/><br/>Translator: 549690339<br/><br/>The breakthrough of his main body was a great benefit to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>It was also a great benefit to the cultivation of his void Dragon Body!<br/><br/>After Wang Xian’s ascension, his main body allowed the great mill of the Five Elements and the Tai Chi Dragon Disc to absorb the metals obtained in the divine kingdom.<br/><br/>His divine dragon body came to the space of the second level!<br/><br/>The energy contained in the space of the second level was much more than that of the first level!<br/><br/>He sat there with his legs crossed. He took out the corpse of the powerhouse and continued to cultivate!<br/><br/>This powerhouse was at the side. He was able to absorb some soul fragments from time to time, which could deepen his understanding of the power of space.<br/><br/>It originated from the top-notch powerhouse in the previous calamity. He had a unique grasp of the power of space.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was cultivating in one spot. In the surrounding area, basically all the holy sons and Saintesses as well as the heaven’s favored ones were surrounding the demon pillar. They were trying their best to obtain the inheritance within.<br/><br/>Some holy sons and saintesses even perished because of this!<br/><br/>Wang Xian didn’t pay attention to these things. He was cultivating all the time.<br/><br/>Time passed by quickly. His control over the power of space was also increasing!<br/><br/>In just 20 million years, he could sense the arrival of the shackle.<br/><br/>A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. With a jolt of his body, a powerful force broke through this shackle.<br/><br/>It was an easy breakthrough!<br/><br/>The fourth level of the universe dominator.<br/><br/>The increase in his strength caused a smile to appear on Wang Xian’s face.<br/><br/>He opened his eyes and felt the energy in his body.<br/><br/>He moved and arrived at the entrance to the first level of the space. He entered directly.<br/><br/>At the exit, there were still many holy sons and saintesses from other forces gathered.<br/><br/>Some were cultivating in the surroundings while others were thinking of ways to enter the second level.<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew out from the second level and continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>He took out his communication device and contacted long yinyin and long yinhao!<br/><br/>Soon, Long Yinyin and long Yinhao received a message! Wang Xian gave them some instructions and flew in a direction.<br/><br/>“Brother Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>“Brother Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>“Holy son Wang Xian.”<br/><br/>Soon, Long yinyin, Long Yinhao, and the rest appeared.<br/><br/>They were followed by a group of disciples from the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground.<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled at them. “Let’s go. I’ll bring you to a place!”<br/><br/>“Brother, did you find any opportunities?” Upon hearing that, Long Yinhao asked excitedly!<br/><br/>“I guess so. However, there are many people there.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and said, “It’s the second level of the space. Haven’t you heard of it?”<br/><br/>“The second level of the space? I’ve heard of it. I’ve heard that the energy in that space is even more abundant. Furthermore, there are opportunities in there. The holy sons and Saintesses of the top-notch forbidden lands are all there!<br/><br/>Long Yinhao quickly replied! “Yes, that’s the place! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head.<br/><br/>“I’ve heard that one needs the strength of a level three universe dominator to be able to enter that place. Brother Wang Xian, can we enter that place?” Long Yinhao asked.<br/><br/>“Yes, I’ve obtained some opportunities in there. My strength has increased. Due to the space attribute, it’s enough to bring you guys in!” Wang Xian said.<br/><br/>He could indeed bring them into the second level now.<br/><br/>To enter the second level, they had to pass through the space storm. Before they had a breakthrough, he couldn’t bring them in. However, after the breakthrough, it was enough!<br/><br/>“Are you kidding me, Brother? You’ve broken through again?”<br/><br/>Long Yinhao’s incredulous voice was heard!<br/><br/>“Let’s Go! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled. With a wave of his arm, a wave of energy enveloped them and brought them forward.<br/><br/>“Our Saint Wang Xian has broken through again. isn’t his speed too fast? It has only been a short while, but he has… he has broken through so quickly! ”<br/><br/>“Yeah, this is too terrifying. Now that our Saint Wang Xian has the strength of a level four overlord of the universe, doesn’t that mean that he’s comparable to the barbarian saint of the unfettered forbidden land and the flowing moon saint of the Flowing Water Forbidden Land?”<br/><br/>“His strength is comparable. This saint Wang Xian is too strong. In the future, he will definitely become a top-notch powerhouse in our universe.”<br/><br/>When the group of disciples from the Dragon Roar forbidden land heard Wang Xian’s words. they were all shocked!<br/><br/>“The current Saint Wang Xian is already a very powerful powerhouse. In Our Dragon Roar Forbidden Land, he’s only slightly weaker than the deacon.<br/><br/>However, how long has our Saint Wang Xian been cultivating for?”? “Furthermore, we can stay here for 100 million years. In the remaining tens of millions of years, sage Wang Xian should be able to raise another level. It shouldn’t be a problem. This is truly heaven-defying! ”<br/><br/>A disciple from the dragon roar forbidden ground exclaimed!<br/><br/>They looked at Wang Xian’s figure. The admiration and admiration they felt was not concealed at all!<br/><br/>At the side, Dragon Roar looked at Wang Xian with admiration and a hint of pride.<br/><br/>Wang Xian brought them to the entrance where a wave of spatial energy enveloped them.<br/><br/>He led them straight to the second level!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>The spatial storm was completely blocked by Wang Xian and successfully brought them into the second level.<br/><br/>“What? That sage Wang Xian actually brought all the disciples of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground into the second level?”<br/><br/>“This?”? ? What kind of strength does he have? Or does he have some powerful treasure ? How could he bring 20 disciples who were not even in the ruler realm into the forbidden ground? Damn, that sage Wang Xian is too freakish ?<br/><br/>Isn’t he too freakish?”<br/><br/>“The Luck of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground is too good! ”<br/><br/>When the group of holy sons and Saintesses of the Sacred Institute of the forbidden ground saw that Wang Xian actually brought people into the forbidden ground, they were all shocked beyond words!<br/><br/>At the same time, they were also envious of the disciples from the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground!<br/><br/>“Wow, they really came in. The second level. The energy here is so dense! ”<br/><br/>“What is that in front of us? There are so many huge demon pillars. There are quite a number of people here! ”<br/><br/>The Dragon Roar and the Dragon Roar entered and looked around in astonishment.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. I’ll bring you guys to the demon pillars to train. These demon pillars contain the corpses of top-notch experts. It’s beneficial to train around the demon pillars! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled at them as he swept his gaze across the magic pillars. There were twelve magic pillars. In the entire sword and magic universe, there were only ten attributes.<br/><br/>The two additional magic pillars were of the water attribute!<br/><br/>In other words, there were three magic pillars of the water attribute here.<br/><br/>The Dragon’s roar forbidden land mainly focused on the water attribute.<br/><br/>He brought along the dragon’s Roar and Dragon’s roar as he flew towards a magic pillar of the water attribute.<br/><br/>The rest of them looked around curiously!<br/><br/>They came to the front of a water attribute demon pillar. There were disciples from the flowing water forbidden ground cultivating around them.<br/><br/>They were slightly surprised when they saw Wang Xian bringing the disciples from the Dragon’s Roar Forbidden Ground.<br/><br/>However, they didn’t say anything.<br/><br/>After all, out of the twelve demon pillars, only Wang Xian had absorbed a space attribute demon pillar and obtained all the inheritances and treasures.<br/><br/>Other than Wang Xian, no one else had succeeded.<br/><br/>Including their SAINTESS flowing moon!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
