There’s someone? Is this a trap?”<br/><br/>The sudden voice stunned Wang Xian. He stared ahead with an extremely vigilant look in his eyes.<br/><br/>Using a human-headed grass as bait was definitely an extremely rare occurrence.<br/><br/>This human-headed grass was a level two skeleton of the universe dominator and was extremely valuable.<br/><br/>An expert who used this as bait would definitely not be weak.<br/><br/>Wang Xian hid behind and stared at the spot in front of him vigilantly.<br/><br/>However, there was no energy fluctuation in the spot in front of him.<br/><br/>In other words, other than the voice just now, he actually didn’t discover the other party’s location.<br/><br/>This surprised him.<br/><br/>The other party was probably very strong!<br/><br/>“However, if you guys don’t come out, I will take the human-headed grass away.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. The Ghost Avatar could ignore the impact of the dry bones. He controlled the ghost avatar to approach the human-headed grass through the position below.<br/><br/>Very soon, the ghost avatar was only 10,000 meters away from the human-headed grass. As long as he accelerated, he would be able to get his hands on it.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian suddenly felt uneasy.<br/><br/>He fixed his gaze on the spot in front of him. After hesitating for a moment, the ghost avatar moved his palm and waves of energy swept towards the human-headed grass.<br/><br/>At the next moment, a skeleton below the human-headed grass started to move instantly.<br/><br/>A surge of energy surged out from his body and attacked the ghost avatar instantly.<br/><br/>“I’ve locked onto him. This guy is a little strange. Kill him!”<br/><br/>The skeleton growled and passed through the dry bones to arrive in front of Ghost Avatar.<br/><br/>Hong<br/><br/>Ghost Avatar didn’t hesitate at all. He opened his mouth, and a black flame shot toward the skeleton.<br/><br/>Ka Ka Ka<br/><br/>“Universe master level two great beings, kill him and absorb him!”<br/><br/>At this moment, three more figures started to move around.<br/><br/>One of them was a walking skeleton with a bone knife in his hand.<br/><br/>The other skeleton was in the shape of a demonic beast. It opened its huge mouth and attacked the Netherworld Ghost.<br/><br/>In an instant, the three skeletons surrounded and attacked.<br/><br/>The strength of each skeleton was at level two master of the universe!<br/><br/>At the back, Wang Xian was slightly shocked when he saw this scene. He didn’t expect that there were three level two universe Dominators hidden here.<br/><br/>Were they lying in ambush here to hunt other powerhouses or to hunt the demon skeletons?<br/><br/>It could be both.<br/><br/>Three level two universe Dominators could completely kill a level two universe dominator.<br/><br/>This was also the reason why they dared to use the human-headed grass as bait.<br/><br/>“If an ordinary powerhouse were to encounter such a situation, they might really die here. However, you guys are really unlucky this time!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling.<br/><br/>This hunting squad should be considered top-notch in the entire land of the devil bones.<br/><br/>After all, such a powerhouse was also considered top-notch in the land of the Devil Bones.<br/><br/>The three of them joined forces to hunt down and kill one after another.<br/><br/>However, they encountered Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s gaze locked onto the human skeleton. He flapped his incipient saint wings and attacked him at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>“Die!”<br/><br/>The human skeleton raised the bone saber in his hand and slashed at the Netherworld Ghost.<br/><br/>Suddenly, a sense of crisis engulfed his heart.<br/><br/>“Oh no!”<br/><br/>The skeleton fire above his head throbbed violently. The bones on his body were undergoing rapid changes.<br/><br/>His original human form had shrunk into a skeleton ball.<br/><br/>“Bang Bang!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw struck the top of his head and actually produced the sound of metal colliding.<br/><br/>This caused his expression to change slightly.<br/><br/>“There are still experts. Be careful!”<br/><br/>The human skeleton hurriedly shouted loudly.<br/><br/>“Surround one of them and kill him!”<br/><br/>At the front, the two skeletons who were surrounding and attacking the ghost avatar shouted sternly.<br/><br/>“You’re courting death!”<br/><br/>Seeing that they had not given up yet, Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold look.<br/><br/>With a move of his palm, the five elements Millstone flew out and continued to attack the skeleton that had shrunk into a ball.<br/><br/>Crash<br/><br/>At the same time, chains spread out in the surroundings and completely surrounded the human skeleton.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>The five elements grinding mill began to operate. With a wave of destructive energy, it continued to attack the human skeleton that was curled up into a ball.<br/><br/>“Oh no, the opponent is very strong. Come and help me!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the human skeleton sensed the danger and shouted sternly.<br/><br/>“It’s Too Late!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian flapped his uninitiated holy wings and instantly arrived behind the human skeleton. His arm turned into a dragon claw. The Dragon Claw emitted light power and directly grabbed at the human skeleton.<br/><br/>“Light, not good!”<br/><br/>The human skeleton’s expression changed drastically.<br/><br/>His defense was very strong, but light and darkness countered each other. Light would attack him. If he only defended himself, the damage would be twice as much as other elemental attacks.<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>When the Light Dragon Claw landed on the human skeleton, a special sound rang out.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>At this moment, the terrifying sound of the five elements grinding continued to ring out.<br/><br/>Crack! Crack<br/><br/>Cracks appeared on the human skeleton’s body. His skeleton fire was throbbing violently and was filled with fear.<br/><br/>“Save me!”<br/><br/>He hurriedly shouted.<br/><br/>“What!”<br/><br/>“Damn it, how can the opponent be so strong?”<br/><br/>The expressions of the other two masters of the universe with stage two combat strength changed drastically. They quickly attacked Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Ghost Claw, Die!”<br/><br/>At the position in front of them, the ghost avatar waved his hand and numerous ferocious claws attacked them.<br/><br/>“Chains of light!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian ignored the attacks of the two skeletons. The chains completely restrained the human-shaped skeleton.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>The Five Elements Millstone was activated and an Earth Shield appeared in front of Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>The earth shield easily blocked the attacks of the two skeletons.<br/><br/>“The opponent is very strong. Run!”<br/><br/>“His strength is too strange. He is much stronger than an ordinary level two universe knight. Run!”<br/><br/>The expressions of the other two skeletons changed drastically when they saw the human-shaped skeletons being captured. They fled into the distance in shock and anger.<br/><br/>“Peng!”<br/><br/>They pounced into the dried bones and their energy disappeared quickly?<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian grabbed the human-shaped skeleton’s body and looked at the spot where the two skeletons disappeared. His expression changed.<br/><br/>His dragon eyes stared in that direction, but he could not lock onto the figure of the other party.<br/><br/>“What a powerful concealment and escape method.”<br/><br/>His face was full of surprise. Following that, he looked at the skeleton in his hand in pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>This was a skeleton that was born with intelligence. It had the combat strength of a level two universe overlord.<br/><br/>Its entire body was extremely tough. It could easily withstand Wang Xian’s all-out attack.<br/><br/>If not for the five elemental grindstone, Wang Xian alone would definitely not be able to suppress it.<br/><br/>“However, this is an unexpected surprise. Just by relying on this skeleton, the tai chi dragon plate will be able to achieve a breakthrough.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes were glowing.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
