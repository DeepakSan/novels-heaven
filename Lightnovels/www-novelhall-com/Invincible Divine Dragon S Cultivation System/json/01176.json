A terrifying Earth elemental energy formed a cage and attacked the sand-covered shadow on the ground!<br/><br/>He raised his head and waved his arm. The fragments of the starfield enveloped the surroundings and rapidly expanded into the shape of a planet!<br/><br/>A strong suction force sucked all the powerful disciples from the six universes into the planet!<br/><br/>Exclamations rang out. Countless strong disciples from the six universe tribes were sucked into the planet, including tianci, who was also standing on top of the planet!<br/><br/>The planet was suspended in the sky behind Wang Xian. His gaze was fixed on the Duke of Heaven’s Gate who was rushing over as well as another strong disciple from the Void universe!<br/><br/>“You want to stop us? You’re courting death!<br/><br/>When the Duke of Heaven’s Gate saw Wang Xian making a move, his eyes revealed a cold and sinister look!<br/><br/>He moved his hand and a small knife appeared in his hand.<br/><br/>The small knife slashed directly in Wang Xian’s direction!<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>The Duke of Heaven’s Gate and the other void universe powerhouse immediately increased their speed!<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, one of the two figures took out a treasure that looked like a swamp and threw it at the Linniu!<br/><br/>“Wait for them to get closer!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw their attack, he immediately transmitted his voice to the linniu!<br/><br/>Lin Niu’s eyes sparkled as he nodded his head.<br/><br/>Earlier, the strength that Wang Xian used did not exceed that of the Heaven’s origin realm!<br/><br/>He was waiting for them to get closer!<br/><br/>In the face of such an expert, even if Wang Xian and the rest had already lost the suppression of the power of the universe, they still had to be fully confident!<br/><br/>The spatial attribute small knife instantly arrived beside Wang Xian. Wang Xian hurriedly dodged and blocked it!<br/><br/>He put some distance between his body and the planet behind him!<br/><br/>The Unicorn Ox’s single horn emitted a radiance and released a stream of energy to meet the swamp-like treasure.<br/><br/>He only used a tenth of his strength!<br/><br/>“The Ultimate Treasure of the Heaven’s origin is mine!<br/><br/>In an instant, the four Heaven’s origin powerhouses broke through the defense line of Wang Xian and the Unicorn Ox!<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>Another figure flew out from the ground and attacked Tianci on the planet as well!<br/><br/>“Hahaha, the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan belongs to my old Devil!<br/><br/>While all the tribal powerhouses on the planet were looking at this scene in horror.<br/><br/>Among the tribal powerhouses, a figure suddenly exploded and a powerhouse with a terrifying aura appeared from his body.<br/><br/>This powerhouse’s pitch-black claws were clawing towards tianci!<br/><br/>In addition, one of the tribe’s disciples had a change in expression. He was also attacking Tianci at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>The tribe’s powerhouses’disciples around him were instantly killed by the terrifying energy fluctuations!<br/><br/>In an instant, two tianyuan manifestation powerhouses appeared from the bodies of the six paths universe tribe’s powerhouses’disciples.<br/><br/>This strange and powerful method was something that Wang Xian had never expected!<br/><br/>However, the seven powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin realm attacked Tianci. Wang Xian did not panic at all. Instead, he revealed a faint smile on his face!<br/><br/>The seven powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin realm were already very close to tianci.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was also very close to them!<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>His mind jolted. The planet that was formed from the fragments of the entire galaxy exploded into a ball of fog instantly!<br/><br/>” Lost Planet!<br/><br/>This was a special planet within the fragment of the galaxy.<br/><br/>It could create a powerful environment.<br/><br/>Once the weaker ones were hit, they would be lost in the illusion.<br/><br/>In addition, the powerhouses who were in the illusion might suffer fatal attacks from the outside.<br/><br/>This lost planet was not of much use to the strong ones in the Heaven’s origin realm.<br/><br/>However, these seven strong ones in the Heaven’s origin realm were already below the level of the Heaven’s origin realm when they were suppressed in the six paths universe!<br/><br/>Furthermore, Wang Xian possessed the strength of the Heaven’s origin realm.<br/><br/>One person could fight against or even kill more than a dozen of them!<br/><br/>Under such circumstances, Wang Xian controlled the lost planet and instantly caused the seven strong ones in the Heaven’s origin realm to feel the changes in their surroundings!<br/><br/>Their surroundings had turned into mirrors.<br/><br/>Their faces were in the mirrors. There were countless mirrors around them and countless disciples!<br/><br/>“What’s going on?”<br/><br/>The sudden change made the seven powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin realm slightly shocked. Their faces were filled with astonishment.<br/><br/>Duke of Heaven’s Gate’s pupils constricted slightly as well. He quickly swept his gaze across the surroundings.<br/><br/>In his line of sight, his companion had already disappeared!<br/><br/>There were mirrors all around him. His appearance was all over the mirrors.<br/><br/>” Illusion? A special treasure? Space Tremor!<br/><br/>He growled and the power of space rushed towards his surroundings!<br/><br/>When the space tremor attacked his surroundings, a familiar scream was heard!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw that his trap had succeeded, a smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>Duke of Heaven’s Gate and his companion were still in the same position.<br/><br/>His aoe attack landed directly on his companion.<br/><br/>The powerful attack made his companion let out a scream!<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s body moved. His speed was comparable to their teleportation speed. He arrived in front of this heaven’s origin creator in the Void Universe!<br/><br/>With a move of his palm, a huge dragon claw enveloped him directly.<br/><br/>The terrifying power of death instantly passed through his body and killed him completely.<br/><br/>Duke of Heaven’s Gate’s expression changed drastically when he heard this scream!<br/><br/>He hurriedly used his energy to protect his body and scanned his surroundings vigilantly!<br/><br/>Crack! Crack! Crack<br/><br/>In the next second, he felt that all the mirrors around him were shattered. A terrifying claw covered it!<br/><br/>The claw contained energy that could seal everything. It also contained the threat of death!<br/><br/>His heart pounded violently. He wanted to escape!<br/><br/>However, there was a huge gap between his current strength and Wang Xian’s!<br/><br/>A branch was sent into his body to prevent him from using special treasures to escape.<br/><br/>Following that, Wang Xian clenched his palm.<br/><br/>A miserable scream rang out. The life force of Duke of Heaven’s Gate was instantly extinguished!<br/><br/>A spatial attribute powerhouse with the ability to control was easily killed by Wang Xian!<br/><br/>The suppression of the universe, the sudden sneak attack, and the two void universe powerhouses who were caught off guard.<br/><br/>All kinds of conditions were added together, causing Wang Xian to kill two heaven origin creation stage powerhouses consecutively.<br/><br/>“PFFT! PFFT! ”<br/><br/>At the side, Lin Niu also launched a fatal attack on the other few powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin realm!<br/><br/>The current situation was similar to a powerhouse of the Heaven’s origin realm launching a sneak attack on a powerhouse at the peak of the ruler realm.<br/><br/>How could he defend himself before he could react?<br/><br/>He couldn’t defend at all!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
