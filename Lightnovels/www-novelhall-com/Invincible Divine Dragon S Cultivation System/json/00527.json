He flapped his huge wings.<br/><br/>“Dragon Clouds!”<br/><br/>He let out a low roar. In Bai Cheng Alliance leader’s line of sight, leaves suddenly appeared around him. The leaves caused a huge obstruction to his vision.<br/><br/>On his body, red eyes continuously scanned his surroundings, filled with uneasiness!<br/><br/>Red Eyes. Only in times of crisis and uneasiness would they appear like this.<br/><br/>“His speed is too fast, simply too fast.”<br/><br/>The Hundred City Alliance Master’s expression was extremely unsightly. Without the slightest hesitation, he continuously retreated backwards.<br/><br/>At the same time, he waved his arm, and the Phantom image of a devil dragon condensed around him.<br/><br/>The Shadows of the demonic dragons surrounded him and protected him.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian’s figure appeared on the right and attacked him with his dragon claws.<br/><br/>Roar! Roar<br/><br/>The Shadows of the demonic dragons around him roared and blocked Wang Xian’s attack.<br/><br/>“Peak spirit!”<br/><br/>The Shadows of the demonic dragons around him started to crumble. The alliance leader of the Hundred Cities had a drastic change in expression as he extended his left hand backward.<br/><br/>Weng Weng Weng Weng<br/><br/>At this moment, everyone on Hundred City Peak felt the entire mountain peak move.<br/><br/>“What’s going on?”<br/><br/>“That great being from Dragon Palace seems to be very strong. Our Hundred City Alliance leader is temporarily suppressed!”<br/><br/>“Is Our Alliance leader going to release his trump card?”<br/><br/>The eyes of the group of great being disciples from Hundred City gleamed.<br/><br/>“Attack!”<br/><br/>In the sky, in the center of the group of Universe Masters, an old man glanced around and growled.<br/><br/>“Hundred City Alliance Master, we’ll help you!”<br/><br/>They growled, and more than 30 universe masters with level-two combat power flew forward.<br/><br/>“No Need!”<br/><br/>However, at this time, Hundred City Alliance master growled. His Dark Demon Dragon Eyes were staring ahead, and his face was full of coldness and coldness.<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>At this moment, the hundred cities peak was still trembling. On the top of the 108 peaks, the innate spiritual treasures flew towards the staff in the hands of the leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>On his staff, the blood-red eyes widened.<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>One by one, the innate spiritual treasures entered the blood-red eyes and entered their insides.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes focused when he saw this scene.<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>“Skull Cross Spike!”<br/><br/>He growled and a mask appeared. It attacked the Bai Cheng Alliance leader in front of him.<br/><br/>“Innate formation, defend!”<br/><br/>Bai Cheng Alliance leader growled and the 108 innate spiritual treasures entered the blood-red eye of his staff. He raised his staff and a defensive formation was formed around him instantly.<br/><br/>All Kinds of energy revolved, forming a defensive barrier.<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>“Crack Crack Crack!”<br/><br/>The skull crucifix landed on it, and the defense began to collapse bit by bit.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Seeing his defensive array formation collapse, Hundred Cities Alliance master exclaimed in surprise, and his expression instantly became ugly.<br/><br/>The other party still had powerful treasures.<br/><br/>“Innate great array, devil flag!”<br/><br/>His gaze focused and the staff in his hand condensed into a huge demon flag. The demon flag waved and covered the area in front of him directly.<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the formations one after another and revealed an astonished expression.<br/><br/>He flapped his incipient saint wings and hurriedly dodged to the side.<br/><br/>He easily dodged the attack of his formation.<br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/>The Alliance Master of Bai Cheng’s expression was a little ugly. Waves of energy were injected into the staff in his hand.<br/><br/>“That great being from Dragon Palace is so powerful. He was able to force our alliance leader to such an extent!”<br/><br/>“After all, they are all universe masters with level-three combat power. How could there be such a huge gap between them?”<br/><br/>“It should be very difficult for the other party to defeat our alliance leader. After all, our alliance leader did not even ask for our support!”<br/><br/>Behind them, a group of universe masters with level-two Combat Power were watching the battle ahead with sparkling eyes.<br/><br/>“Is this all your strength? It Won’t be long before I kill you!”<br/><br/>Alliance master Bai Cheng scanned his surroundings and roared coldly.<br/><br/>“Hehe, with just you? You should be the one who dies!”<br/><br/>A mocking look appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes. He flapped his incipient saint wings and instantly appeared behind him.<br/><br/>Sensing the threat coming from behind, Alliance Master Bai Cheng’s expression changed drastically. His golden tail swept out once again.<br/><br/>“Bang, Bang, Bang!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stretched out his dragon claw and clawed at the golden tail. A large amount of blood flowed out from the golden tail.<br/><br/>“Scram!”<br/><br/>Bai Cheng Alliance Master roared in a low voice. He raised the staff in his hands and said, “Hundred Mountains, suppress!”<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>In the blood-red eyes of his staff, mountain peaks flew out suddenly. The mountain peaks contained a terrifying power.<br/><br/>The mountain peaks grew bigger and rotated around him. Soon, 108 mountain peaks were formed.<br/><br/>“Too heavy!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze across these mountain peaks. A solemn expression appeared in his eyes.<br/><br/>He flapped his incipient saint wings and appeared in front of one of the mountain peaks. He swept his dragon tail across it.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>A terrifying collision sound rang out. That mountain peak trembled slightly and cracks appeared on it. However, it did not collapse immediately.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and launched another attack.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>However, at this moment, meteorites erupted from the surrounding mountains and charged towards Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved and dodged in a hurry.<br/><br/>Bang! Bang! Bang<br/><br/>Relying on his speed, he arrived in front of the other mountains and landed his attacks on them one after another.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>A mountain could not withstand the violent energy and collapsed immediately.<br/><br/>“Next time, I will definitely kill you!”<br/><br/>Seeing that he had no way to deal with Wang Xian, the chief of the Hundred Cities Alliance let out a low growl with a face full of unwillingness. His body flew backward.<br/><br/>Under the protection of the many mountains, Wang Xian had no way to deal with them.<br/><br/>“Chief of the Hundred Cities Alliance, you are just so-so!”<br/><br/>He did not continue to chase after them because the base of Bai Cheng and the rest was right behind him.<br/><br/>If he did not have this base, Wang Xian was confident that he could grind them to death.<br/><br/>However, not to mention the formation set up in this base, he did not need to take the risk.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there were more than 30 level 2 masters of the universe behind him who did not make a move.<br/><br/>If they made a move, it would bring Wang Xian a lot of trouble.<br/><br/>“Our Alliance chief is actually not his match!”<br/><br/>At the back, the strong disciples of Bai Cheng had a nasty look on their faces when they saw this scene!<br/><br/>The strongest person from the Dragon Palace had actually suppressed their alliance chief.<br/><br/>“Next time, I will definitely kill you!”<br/><br/>He stared at the alliance chief and said the same thing.<br/><br/>As long as the Five Elements Millstone had a breakthrough again, or the Water Touch King had a breakthrough, Wang Xian was confident that he would be able to destroy it.<br/><br/>“We will see who kills who before long!”<br/><br/>The Hundred City Alliance leader’s expression was a little ugly as he roared with bloodshot eyes.<br/><br/>“Hehe!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian chuckled and turned around to leave immediately. He flew into the distance.<br/><br/>He had already tried out the strength of the Hundred City Alliance leader. The next time would be the day of his death.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
