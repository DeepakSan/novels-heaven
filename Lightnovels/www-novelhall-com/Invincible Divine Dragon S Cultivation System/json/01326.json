Boom! Boom<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>The two powerhouses who had just entered the heavenly yuan creation stage widened their eyes and unleashed a terrifying attack that landed on Wang Xian’s body.<br/><br/>They wanted to finish off their companion.<br/><br/>Finish off the powerhouse at the control level.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>However, when their attack landed on Wang Xian’s body, they realized that it was easily blocked.<br/><br/>This caused them to reveal a look of horror!<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>At this moment, they saw that the powerhouse of their Xiao Yao sect was directly destroyed.<br/><br/>A powerhouse at the control level was directly destroyed!<br/><br/>They revealed a look of horror on their faces.<br/><br/>“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”<br/><br/>“You are a powerhouse at the Great Dao Level!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the powerhouse of Xiao Yao sect who was attacked by Wang Xian and directly destroyed by Wang Xian.<br/><br/>His flesh and blood gathered rapidly at a corner in a strange manner.<br/><br/>He stared at Wang Xian with an embarrassed and shocked expression and roared furiously!<br/><br/>He was resurrected quickly with his powerful ultimate treasure!<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>Just like before, after he resurrected and roared furiously, Wang Xian’s figure followed closely behind him!<br/><br/>The Dragon Claw was clawing at him once again!<br/><br/>Death descended on his body once again!<br/><br/>All of this was within Wang Xian’s expectations.<br/><br/>He had been activating it all along during the battle.<br/><br/>With his strength, it was not a big problem for him to divine an expert at the control level.<br/><br/>The lamp of divination also indicated that he would be resurrected with a treasure the moment he was destroyed!<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>When the expert from the carefree sect saw Wang Xian’s attack again, he let out a roar of anger and despair.<br/><br/>At this moment, he could clearly sense that Wang Xian was not an ordinary expert at the Great Dao level.<br/><br/>He was an expert at the Great Dao level with an extremely deep foundation.<br/><br/>He was not someone he could fight against.<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>His body was once again under the attack of Death!<br/><br/>This made him feel helpless. He waved his arm and many treasures flew out of his body towards the two heavenly yuan creation realm experts.<br/><br/>“Dodge!”<br/><br/>Before he died, he gave a warning!<br/><br/>“Be careful, let’s work together!”<br/><br/>The five experts from the sword sect flew over from another location. When they saw this scene, their pupils constricted as they roared!<br/><br/>The eyes of the two heaven origin creation realm powerhouses from the carefree sect were about to split open. They were terrified!<br/><br/>Their attacks landed on Wang Xian’s body, but they were completely ineffective!<br/><br/>The strength of the opponent was just as the seniors at the control level had said. It was at the Great Dao level!<br/><br/>Their bodies moved as they took over the treasures one by one. They quickly approached the sword sect powerhouse!<br/><br/>At the same time, a Heavenly Kismet realm expert waved his arm.<br/><br/>A round ball flew into the air.<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>Following the sound of an explosion, a blood-red boat was formed.<br/><br/>The blood-red boat was located in the sky. It did not disperse for a long time. It could be seen from a great distance!<br/><br/>At this moment, all the experts and disciples in the surroundings were stunned!<br/><br/>The experts from the carefree sect and the sword sect had arrived.<br/><br/>A total of eight heavenly fate realm experts had arrived.<br/><br/>Three of them were at the control level.<br/><br/>In the blink of an eye, a control level existence was insta-killed.<br/><br/>This? ?<br/><br/>Especially the terrified roar of the carefree sect’s control level expert before his death, it also made all the experts know that the mysterious young man was actually a great dao level existence.<br/><br/>This caused all the experts and disciples to be incomparably shocked.<br/><br/>First, he instantly killed a sect ancestor of the sword sect, and now, he killed an expert of the Xiao Yao sect.<br/><br/>How terrifying!<br/><br/>“Where did this expert come from? He’s not an expert of our Justice Alliance. How… how could he be so powerful! ?”<br/><br/>“Hiss, this strength is truly terrifying. No wonder he dared to kill experts of the sword sect and the Xiao Yao sect. No wonder!”<br/><br/>“This is too terrifying. In just a few minutes, I actually saw the deaths of two saints!”<br/><br/>All the expert disciples were stunned when they saw this scene. They were somewhat dumbfounded!<br/><br/>“Attack together. Don’t split up. Surround and attack him!”<br/><br/>One of the control-level experts from the sword sect stared at Wang Xian with a solemn expression and shouted loudly.<br/><br/>At the same time, he passed this news to all the experts from the sword sect who had yet to arrive.<br/><br/>The Sword sect didn’t know the existence of these experts.<br/><br/>The strongest expert of their sword sect was also in the area of Chaos!<br/><br/>“Trap him and wait for the carefree sect’s patriarch and our sword sect’s patriarch to join forces. At that time, we’ll definitely make him pay a terrible price and keep him here!”<br/><br/>The Sword Sect’s controlling expert sent a stern voice transmission to his companion and the two heaven origin creation realm experts of the carefree sect.<br/><br/>Although the opponent’s strength was abnormally terrifying.<br/><br/>They were not afraid at all.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this was a situation where the two sects were working together!<br/><br/>Once they worked together, they would be able to kill the opponent, even if he was a great dao level powerhouse!<br/><br/>“Kill! Kill!”<br/><br/>The group of Heaven Origin Creation Realm powerhouses roared in anger. They waved their arms and launched terrifying attacks at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>The combined strength of seven heaven origin creation realm powerhouses far exceeded that of ordinary Great Dao realm powerhouses!<br/><br/>Even Wang Xian would take that terrifying attack seriously!<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and a divine dragon circled above him.<br/><br/>The Divine Dragon roared and attacked them directly!<br/><br/>The Divine Dragon swayed its huge body and destroyed their attacks one after another. It continued to attack them.<br/><br/>Although the Divine Dragon’s might had weakened a lot, this scene still shocked all the powerful disciples.<br/><br/>“Although the sword sect and the Footloose sect’s experts didn’t come all together, when these seven joined forces, they were comparable to one great dao realm expert. In addition to the four weakest beginner-level experts, they were still suppressed under such circumstances. This mysterious expert is so terrifying!”<br/><br/>Around them, there were some controlling-level heaven-origin creation-level experts who were watching the battle with a solemn expression!<br/><br/>Some of the beginner-level heaven-origin creation-level experts looked at Wang Xian with a hint of fear.<br/><br/>This was an extremely terrifying existence even at the heaven-origin creation-level.<br/><br/>“The opponent is very strong. Don’t let him break them one by one. Let’s get close together!”<br/><br/>The control-level powerhouse from the Sword Sect, who was holding a sharp metal sword in his hand, saw that their attacks were blocked by Wang Xian. Furthermore, the aftershocks of their attacks continued to attack them.<br/><br/>This made his face filled with a solemn and shocked expression. Immediately, he shouted loudly!<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>The surrounding heaven origin creator-level powerhouses also felt the strength of Wang Xian. In order to prevent them from being broken one by one, they quickly got close to each other!<br/><br/>“Humph!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian snorted softly. The divination lamp emitted a luster as it looked for their weaknesses!<br/><br/>After all, the other party was not a single entity. There were many weaknesses!<br/><br/>When he saw the result of the divination lamp, his body moved and instantly concealed his figure, disappearing from their sight!<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>“Has he left?”<br/><br/>When the five powerhouses who had just entered the Heaven’s origin realm saw that Wang Xian had disappeared, their expressions changed slightly. They immediately asked!<br/><br/>“No, I can vaguely sense that he hasn’t left yet. Be careful!”<br/><br/>“You must be careful!”<br/><br/>The sect master of the Golden Sect of the central sword sect reminded him with a solemn expression!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
