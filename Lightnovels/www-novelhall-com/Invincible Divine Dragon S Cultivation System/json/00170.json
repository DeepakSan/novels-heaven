Three days ago, countless people were talking about it on the universe AI.<br/><br/>However, at the beginning, the Skeleton Island was heading towards the volcano region. They were only guessing and couldn’t be 100% sure.<br/><br/>However, during these three days, the skeleton race and the nine blade race attacked the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Compared to the beginning, some knights came to watch the battle.<br/><br/>At this moment, there were many people around the battlefield.<br/><br/>For example, the warriors of the Willow deity dojo.<br/><br/>The other domain level warriors.<br/><br/>When they heard this news, they immediately flew over to the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>When they saw that the battle was still going on, they were extremely shocked.<br/><br/>“It’s not just the skeleton race, the nine-sword race, and the blood evil race. The blood evil race is a powerful race, and the three races are besieging the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>“Brother above, your information is outdated. The three races have been fighting the Dragon Palace for three days and three nights. The skeleton race has billions and billions of skeletons participating in the battle. However, other than the battle at the supremacy level, the ordinary disciples of the three races are almost destroyed by the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>“It’s a great war. The three races besieged the Dragon Palace race. The battle lasted for three days and three nights, and the number of God Emperor Warriors participating reached over a million. It’s too terrifying.”<br/><br/>“This war is completely a dog compared to a god Emperor. The god Emperor Disciples of the skeleton race are like cannon fodder. The Dragon Palace alone is not at a disadvantage against the three races. It’s too powerful.”<br/><br/>“I heard that the Dragon Palace has 40 universe knights. I wonder if that’s true.”<br/><br/>“In this war, several universe knights have already died.”<br/><br/>On the universe’s AI, countless people were discussing in shock.<br/><br/>A great war had shown them the cruelty of war.<br/><br/>The Godly kings were inferior to dogs in the war.<br/><br/>It was difficult for the godly emperor to keep his life here.<br/><br/>“I didn’t expect junior brother Wang Xian’s dragon palace to be so powerful. Hiss.”<br/><br/>Around the battlefield, the people from the willow deity Daoist sect who had rushed over after hearing the news looked at the battlefield in front of them. Their faces were filled with shock.<br/><br/>The powerhouses from the Dragon Palace had already rushed to the skeleton island and were engaged in a frenzied massacre on the island.<br/><br/>The rapid raindrops kept falling and contained a wave of powerful raindrops to prevent anyone from escaping back to their own divine kingdom.<br/><br/>The war that could not be backed off was abnormally fierce.<br/><br/>“Junior brother Wang Xian is the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. His subordinates are too powerful.”<br/><br/>The disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect stared at him in shock.<br/><br/>However, what the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect did not notice was that not far away from them, there was a woman holding a willow cane hiding at the side. She was looking at the Dragon Palace and some members of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Her long hair was like black hair. She was holding a willow tree that did not match her appearance. There was a hesitant look on her face.<br/><br/>Boom Boom Boom<br/><br/>In the sky in front, the battle continued.<br/><br/>The three races relied on the combat strength of two universe knights at level three to fight against the 35 universe knights of the Dragon Palace. They were not at a disadvantage at all.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian and the rest were not at a disadvantage when facing them.<br/><br/>A battle that was evenly matched would be a long-lasting battle.<br/><br/>On the skeleton island below, an enormous coffin rose up. The coffin was earthy yellow and contained an extremely heavy aura.<br/><br/>Suddenly, Chu Xian’s coffin attacked a universe knight from the Dragon Palace. Caught off guard, the Universe Knight from the Dragon Palace was directly suppressed and killed.<br/><br/>This scene shocked all the members of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Be careful of that coffin. Be careful, the skeleton race still has a trump card.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister GUI’s expression changed slightly. He rushed into the battlefield and warned loudly.<br/><br/>“Kill, Kill!”<br/><br/>“Our skeleton race has been established for billions of years. How can we be afraid of Your Little Dragon Palace? Kill them.”<br/><br/>The golden skeleton led the skeleton race and roared coldly.<br/><br/>This time, the entire skeleton clan attacked, and there were countless skeleton members on the entire Skeleton Island.<br/><br/>The Skeleton Island was also their paradise.<br/><br/>Here, they had all their trump cards.<br/><br/>That earthy yellow coffin was an incomparably powerful acquired spirit treasure.<br/><br/>Within the coffin, tens of millions of skeletons sacrificed their lives and instantly unleashed terrifying attacks.<br/><br/>They killed a universe knight of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>This was the first Universe Knight of the Dragon Palace to fall.<br/><br/>“Kill, Kill, Kill!”<br/><br/>The disciples of the Dragon Palace were on guard and shouted sternly.<br/><br/>The battle once again entered a stalemate.<br/><br/>The war continued.<br/><br/>As time passed, almost everyone in the Milky Way knew about the battle between the three races surrounding the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Countless experts flew over curiously.<br/><br/>When they came to the front of the battlefield and saw the battlefield in front of them, their faces revealed an extremely shocked expression.<br/><br/>Tragic!<br/><br/>Truly tragic.<br/><br/>The skeletons of the skeleton race lay scattered at the bottom of the Milky Way. At a glance, it was a shocking sight.<br/><br/>That terrifying power made everyone’s heart palpitate.<br/><br/>Countless people looked over in shock, their eyes wide open.<br/><br/>The Terrifying Battle of knights in the sky made them even more shocked, they didn’t dare to get close, they could only watch from afar.<br/><br/>Day after day passed, on the 10th day, there were already hundreds of thousands of knights gathered around.<br/><br/>“It’s been 10 days since the battle, the Dragon Palace’s strength is almost equal to the three races.”<br/><br/>“I guess the war is coming to an end. The three clans can’t destroy the Dragon Palace at all, and it will be very difficult for the Dragon Palace to destroy the three clans.”<br/><br/>“Hiss, this is too terrifying. The war has lasted for ten days.”<br/><br/>Ten days passed slowly, and everyone in the surroundings was discussing in shock.<br/><br/>The victory and defeat had not been decided in ten days, and it was very likely that the war would end here.<br/><br/>“Damn it, damn it!”<br/><br/>In the sky, the clan leaders of the bloodthirsty clan and the golden skeleton clan had extremely ugly expressions on their faces.<br/><br/>They had never thought that this war would be like this.<br/><br/>Ten days, ten whole days, and they still hadn’t destroyed the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>In fact, there was almost no hope for them to destroy the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The strength of the Dragon Palace Dragon King and the array master was so powerful that they were shocked.<br/><br/>Even if they had two universe knights at level 3 and the other only had one, they couldn’t suppress the other for 10 days.<br/><br/>If they couldn’t destroy the Dragon Palace this time, their losses would be too great.<br/><br/>Not to mention the death of the knight level, just the disciple had already lost 60-70% .<br/><br/>67% of the disciples had died. What was the meaning of this?<br/><br/>“Hahaha, a bunch of trash. Continue the battle. This battle will not end until the victor is determined.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze across all the Knights of the three races. His face was filled with recklessness.<br/><br/>In this half a month, the Dragon Palace had killed a large number of strong warriors of the three races.<br/><br/>Currently, there were already members of the Dragon Palace who were improving in the dragon transformation pool.<br/><br/>In a few days, that terrifying resource would allow the Dragon Palace to produce two knights at level 2 and over a dozen knights at Level 1.<br/><br/>Once they broke through, the battle situation would be completely changed.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
