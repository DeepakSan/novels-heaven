Let me know if we can find a few peak experts.”<br/><br/>The third Prince said!<br/><br/>“It’s the third Prince!”<br/><br/>Baili nodded.<br/><br/>In the front, when the Holy Dragon King and the others heard the words invincible zone, their expressions changed slightly!<br/><br/>“If the third prince can summon the experts from the invincible zone, we can definitely kill them!”<br/><br/>The Sacred Dragon King quickly said!<br/><br/>“Well, I will send some angels to your tribe. Don’t worry that the Dragon Palace will continue to attack you!”<br/><br/>The third prince continued to say indifferently!<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>The Patriarch of the Holy Dragon King’s god-herding clan and the others immediately replied respectfully!<br/><br/>The third prince waved his hand and disappeared!<br/><br/>The Baili Archangel also left directly!<br/><br/>“If there is a peak expert from the Invincible Zone to help us, then it should be no problem to destroy the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>“The Dragon King and the red-clothed woman of the Dragon Palace are also very terrifying existences in the invincible zone. Unless the Great Angel Baili can find those abnormal experts!”<br/><br/>After the third Prince and the Great Angel Baili left, the Sacred Dragon King and the others stood up and said in a deep voice!<br/><br/>“If the third Prince wants to destroy the Dragon Palace, he will definitely be able to destroy them, definitely!”<br/><br/>The great being of the light sound bug race roared in a low voice!<br/><br/>The Invincible region was the name of a domain. It was located within a void crack in the sky above the inner continent!<br/><br/>That Crack was a broken battlefield!<br/><br/>In the past, a large number of great beings at the universe ruler realm and above surrounded and killed a space beast race.<br/><br/>That space crack had been created by the special ability of the space beast. All the great beings who had surrounded and killed the space beast had been trapped and died there!<br/><br/>Although the space beast had been killed in the end, the group of Great Beings had also been trapped and died there.<br/><br/>In that space, there were still broken God countries!<br/><br/>God countries supported the broken space, and there were nine types of attributes flowing inside!<br/><br/>The attributes there were almost tangible, and the law energy could be clearly seen!<br/><br/>Within that space, there were desolate beasts occupying it, and later on, it attracted a large number of great beings.<br/><br/>However, the desolate beasts there were extremely terrifying, and there were many universe masters with level three Combat Power!<br/><br/>There were even some desolate beasts that had absorbed the energy of the Space Beasts and mutated, and their power was extremely terrifying!<br/><br/>With the evolution of time, that place became a training ground for Pinnacle Great Beings!<br/><br/>Currently, those who could stay there were no weaker than level-two universe masters, and most of them were level-three Universe Masters!<br/><br/>The universe was huge, and so was the heaven opening primal continent. In the 20 billion years since the last calamity ended, many Pinnacle Universe Knights had been born!1<br/><br/>Not every pinnacle universe ruler could become a universe ruler!<br/><br/>It was extremely difficult to become a universe ruler!<br/><br/>Some great beings couldn’t break through in 100 million years, 1 billion years, or 5 billion years, which made great beings want to break through!<br/><br/>There were two ways to break through. One was with the help of the universe true treasure.<br/><br/>The second was to comprehend between life and death battles!<br/><br/>Universe true treasures were limited, so they could only take the second way!<br/><br/>Because of the special situation in the invincible region, many great beings came here to seek a breakthrough!<br/><br/>After more than 10 billion years, there were more and more great beings here!<br/><br/>And more and more great beings broke through here!<br/><br/>Because there were great beings who broke through, more great beings came!<br/><br/>Over time, this place became known as the Invincible Region!<br/><br/>Because the great beings here were all extremely terrifying!<br/><br/>There were even great beings from pinnacle races who came here to seek a breakthrough!<br/><br/>Now, in the invincible region, there were a few relatively well-known great beings, and they were all mutated great beings!<br/><br/>In other words, they were existences comparable to mutated godly dragons!<br/><br/>They were at the pinnacle level of universe knights, and they were able to contend against a true universe master!<br/><br/>However, because of their level, they hadn’t reached this level yet, and they were always looking for a chance to break through!<br/><br/>Those beings could easily fight against more than a dozen universe rulers and level-three great beings!<br/><br/>However, the price to invite such a great being over wouldn’t be low!<br/><br/>After all, such a great being could already fight against hundred-lie archangels who didn’t have any connate true treasures!<br/><br/>Sacred Dragon Emperor and the others waited in the hall for a while, and soon, six archangels flew over!<br/><br/>Six 12-winged archangels, True Universe Masters level existences.<br/><br/>They followed Sacred Dragon Emperor and the others back to their nest!<br/><br/>Pinnacle races couldn’t interfere in the wars of high-level races, but if a universe master level great being was a guest of a high-level race, then they couldn’t be disturbed or attacked!<br/><br/>Such words were an offense to the experts of the peak races. The other party could take action!<br/><br/>With the experts of the angel race present, the Sacred Dragon King and the rest returned to their own nest and waited for the news!<br/><br/>The Sacred Dragon King was absorbing the precious treasures given to him by the third prince. He was looking forward to the day when he would break through as soon as possible!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, we have found all the Cosmos God kingdoms. There are 14 Cosmos God kingdoms with the combat strength of a Tier-3 Cosmos ruler!”<br/><br/>At the same time, within the light giant race, Tian Chen and the rest had found all the God kingdoms and reported to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“Let’s go back. We Can’t stay here any longer.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said with a smile!<br/><br/>Tian Chen and the rest nodded their heads!<br/><br/>This time, the Dragon Palace’s harvest was extremely terrifying!<br/><br/>41 corpses of a Tier-3 universe dominator and 14 Cosmos God kingdoms of the same level!<br/><br/>Apart from that, there were a large number of treasures in these 14 God kingdoms as well as the treasure trove of the Mu God clan!<br/><br/>As for the Mu God clan, the eight-limbed demonic fiend entered the treasure trove of the Mu God clan the moment it entered their grotto-heaven blessed land and obtained a large number of treasures!<br/><br/>All in all, after this battle, the number of Level 3 universe masters of the Dragon Palace could exceed 100!<br/><br/>However, the specific improvement would depend on whether Wang Xian wanted to improve bei Shuang’s realm!<br/><br/>If he could improve bei Shuang’s realm and allow her to reach the peak of a universe knight, then he would be able to fight against a real universe master!<br/><br/>Also, he didn’t know if all the resources could help Wang Xian to achieve a breakthrough in his own strength!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
