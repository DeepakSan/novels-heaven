Some of them hesitated for a moment before following behind from a distance.<br/><br/>They wanted to witness this earth-shattering battle with their own eyes.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“The Golden Light on the Dragon Gate has completely disappeared. The power blocking it has completely disappeared.”<br/><br/>Just as the ancient painting sect and the Divine Dragon Clan were attacking the Dragon Palace, they were in front of the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The energy blocking the Dragon Gate of the Dragon Palace slowly dissipated. They could clearly see everything inside the Heavenly Sea Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The sudden change made all the Demon Beasts’expressions change drastically.<br/><br/>“Charge!”<br/><br/>The great demons of the Demon God Palace sensed that the energy of the dragon gate had completely dissipated. Their eyes were shining.<br/><br/>This was their chance.<br/><br/>Just now, they had tried their best but failed to leap over the Dragon Gate.<br/><br/>Now that the mysterious energy of the Dragon Gate had dissipated, they could directly rush in.<br/><br/>In the next moment, all the demon beasts directly entered the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“No, no, no. Damn that guy. Damn that guy. Why did the Forbidden Art Fail? Why?”<br/><br/>“Is it because I have a dragon soul? Or is there another reason? Why Did I fail? Half of my Dragon Soul has been taken away, and half of my control over the Dragon Palace has disappeared.”<br/><br/>When all the Demon Beasts entered the Sky Sea Dragon Palace, the half-dragon soul of the Sky Sea Dragon King in the Dragon King Hall let out a shrill roar.<br/><br/>This was a plan that he had been planning for billions of years. Billions of years ago, he was about to succeed, but this happened.<br/><br/>Not only did he fail, but his dragon soul was also defeated.<br/><br/>This made him terrified.<br/><br/>With his current situation, he was no longer able to completely control the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>This would definitely attract the covetous eyes of countless great beings.<br/><br/>With his current situation, even within the Dragon Palace, he was unable to contend against Great Beings above universe knight level 3.<br/><br/>The outcome that awaited him was either being destroyed or being subdued.<br/><br/>“Billions of years, all my efforts have been for naught!”<br/><br/>The Tianhai Dragon King’s body trembled violently. He was unwilling, very unwilling.<br/><br/>Billions of years of planning had completely failed because of that fellow.<br/><br/>Now, it had even caused such a situation.<br/><br/>“Looks like I have to find a body.”<br/><br/>He slowly closed his dragon eyes, filled with helplessness.<br/><br/>After being silent for more than ten seconds, he opened his eyes and looked forward.<br/><br/>An image appeared in front of him. In the image, the Heavenly Dragon King was crazily attacking the nomological energy in the distance.<br/><br/>Countless dark symbols surrounded his body.<br/><br/>These symbols were gradually devouring his body.<br/><br/>They were devouring everything about him.<br/><br/>“There’s still a chance, there’s still a chance. As long as I find the purebred divine dragon, there’s still a chance to recover.”<br/><br/>The Tianhai Dragon King’s dragon soul muttered. His figure moved, and in the next moment, he disappeared.<br/><br/>In a medicinal garden where the Tianhai Dragon King was located, the Tianhai Dragon King’s Dragon Soul looked down at the Tianhai Dragon King below, and his expression changed slightly.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>“You’re just a small sub-dragon with a dirty bloodline. I originally didn’t want to take your body, but now that I have no choice, give me your body. This will be your honor!”<br/><br/>The Tianhai Dragon King let out a dense roar as his figure directly charged towards the Sky Dragon King.<br/><br/>“Who? Who Are You?”<br/><br/>The Sky Dragon King’s eyes revealed a blood-red color when he heard this voice. He raised his head and let out a savage roar.<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>However, in the next moment, the Dragon Soul of the Tianhai Dragon King directly charged into the body of the Sky Dragon King.<br/><br/>“I gave you everything that you have now. Now is the time for you to repay me.”<br/><br/>The Tianhai Dragon King’s Dragon Soul roared eerily.<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>When the Tianhai Dragon King heard this, his body trembled.<br/><br/>“You’re the Tianhai Dragon King? You’re the Tianhai Dragon King!”<br/><br/>He roared in fear, and then his expression became even more ferocious. “So what if you’re the Tianhai Dragon King? You Only Have Your Dragon Soul left, and you still want to steal our bodies? Wishful thinking. Get lost.”<br/><br/>“Hehe, your body? In these hundreds of millions of years, I’ve already made all the preparations. I’m now your master. Now, sacrifice your body.”<br/><br/>The Tianhai Dragon King roared in disdain, and his dragon body slowly entered the Tianhai Dragon King’s body.<br/><br/>The Tianhai Dragon King’s body trembled violently, and his eyes were filled with fear and panic.<br/><br/>He struggled for a while, and the light in his eyes slowly faded, and was gradually filled with a cold golden pupil.<br/><br/>The golden pupil was filled with coldness and killing intent.<br/><br/>“I want to completely merge with this body. I want to devour the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, devour his blood and flesh, and improve this dirty bloodline.”<br/><br/>“I want to return to the peak.”<br/><br/>Slowly, the Heaven Dragon King said faintly.<br/><br/>But soon, his face became ugly. He stared at the east entrance of the Dragon Palace, his eyes full of anger and killing intent.<br/><br/>“Damn it, how dare you barge into My Dragon Palace. Alright, Alright. Since you guys want to come in, don’t even think about coming out.”<br/><br/>“Hehe, it’s fortunate that I’ve made a lot of preparations during these billions of years. I’ve prepared a lot for my return to the universe.”<br/><br/>Very soon, he smiled sinisterly.<br/><br/>However, when he sensed the situation in the herb garden, his expression turned ugly once again.<br/><br/>“The Dragon Soul of the Tianhai Dragon King actually escaped?”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian, who was in the herb garden, raised his eyebrows slightly.<br/><br/>The counterattack of the ancestral tree and the escape of the Tianhai Dragon King only lasted for about ten seconds.<br/><br/>“However, his dragon soul seems to have suffered a heavy blow from the ancestral tree. I wonder where he is now.”<br/><br/>“I wonder what level this fellow is at at his peak.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled as he scanned his surroundings.<br/><br/>After confirming that the Sky Sea Dragon Palace should not be in too much danger, he scanned his surroundings.<br/><br/>When he saw that there were godly herbs in a medicinal garden in front of him, he immediately flew over.<br/><br/>The power of law did not affect him much. He waved his arm and immediately kept all the godly herbs of the universe knight level.<br/><br/>Following that, his eyes lit up as he quickly entered the herb gardens.<br/><br/>These godly herbs were a huge resource for the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Perhaps, he could gather all the resources that he had improved.<br/><br/>Wang Xian started to loot the treasures of the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
