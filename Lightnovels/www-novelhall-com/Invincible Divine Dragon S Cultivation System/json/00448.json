It Was Under The Terrifying Space Beast</h1><div class=\"entry-content\" id=\"htmlContent\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3439 3438 had obtained the water lotus. It was under the terrifying space beast<br/><br/>“I got it!”<br/><br/>Under Wang Xian’s sensing, he heaved a sigh of relief when he saw an lie leaving.<br/><br/>That desolate beast with tentacles was at the level of a level two master of the universe.<br/><br/>If Wang Xian went over by himself, it would be hard to predict his life and death.<br/><br/>After all, through the five elements grindstone, he could not even sense the location of the desolate beast.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the attack of the desolate beast was extremely terrifying. The densely packed tentacles blotted out the sky and covered the Sun. Even at the end, he could not see clearly what kind of desolate beast it was.<br/><br/>Fortunately, an lie had the ancient oil lamp protecting him.<br/><br/>However, the attack just now had caused him to lose quite a lot of the life force liquid.<br/><br/>The life force liquid was considered a powerful treasure in the universe.<br/><br/>“Dragon King!”<br/><br/>At this moment, an lie flew over.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and took the water lotus from him.<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>When he saw the water lotus, his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>The first time he obtained the water lotus, it had yet to fully bloom. After absorbing a third-grade water lotus, it had bloomed a lot.<br/><br/>The water lotus he obtained now had a flower bud at one of its six petals. The flower bud was very small as if it was deformed.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian knew that this was a change that the water lotus had undergone during the process of evolution.<br/><br/>The energy contained in this water lotus far exceeded the water lotus that he had obtained previously.<br/><br/>Wang Xian kept it in his body and the three water lotus flowers began to fuse slowly.<br/><br/>“I wonder if I can fuse it into a ninth-grade one. However, the possibility is very small.”<br/><br/>He mumbled as he took the ancient blueprint and looked at it. His eyes were sparkling.<br/><br/>The ancient blueprint still had the water lotus’s display, but to get it, he had to go deeper.<br/><br/>If there was a level two desolate beast with the combat strength of a universe dominator here, what about the deeper part?<br/><br/>Was it the space beast guarding it, or was it an even more powerful desolate beast.<br/><br/>However, it was at least a level two desolate beast with the combat strength of a universe dominator.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s face was pensive.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I think we can go again. If that space beast is here, it should be at the center. There are at most level three desolate beasts with the combat strength of a ruler of the universe here. The ancient oil lamp should be able to withstand it.”<br/><br/>An lie spoke from the side.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at him. “How much of the vitality fluid did the attack just now reduce?”<br/><br/>“About 1% !”<br/><br/>An lie reported!<br/><br/>“Alright, you can continue to try. This time, it will be even more dangerous. Be careful!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was prepared to give it one last try. Regardless of whether he succeeded or not, he would leave this place after this.<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>An lie nodded his head. He moved his body and left immediately.<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed quietly.<br/><br/>The location of the third water lotus was even deeper. An Lie’s speed was very fast.<br/><br/>This time, when he got closer, Wang Xian still didn’t sense any dire beasts around him.<br/><br/>“An lie, act according to the situation. I Can’t Help You!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to him. An lie scanned his surroundings. Without any hesitation, he teleported towards the water lotus.<br/><br/>This time, he didn’t do any Scouting. He relied solely on his speed and luck.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>An lie came in front of the water lotus. His eyes were glowing as he grabbed at it.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>However, at this moment, an incomparably terrifying tentacle rose. It was only one tentacle, but it was at least a few hundred thousand meters long.<br/><br/>An lie felt his breathing stop instantly. The surrounding water flow had stopped flowing.<br/><br/>It was as if the entire space had been confined.<br/><br/>Crack! Crack! Crack<br/><br/>The ancient oil lamp on an Lie’s body was burning rapidly. The life force liquid in it was disappearing at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>“What kind of monster is this?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed this extremely terrifying attack and his breathing stopped.<br/><br/>Everything in the surroundings seemed to be confined. The terrifying tentacles swept over.<br/><br/>There was a terrifying suction cup on the tentacles.<br/><br/>Compared to the tentacles of the dire beast earlier, it was nothing.<br/><br/>“An lie, Hurry!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian urged.<br/><br/>An lie quickly kept the water lotus in front of him.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>The next moment, the tentacles landed on an Lie’s body, causing him to fly backward.<br/><br/>The ancient oil lamp started to flicker and the vitality liquid was almost depleted in an instant.<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>An lie didn’t hesitate at all and began to teleport rapidly.<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>The terrifying tentacle headed straight for the spot where an lie had disappeared and attacked.<br/><br/>A stream of water rushed across billions of kilometers.<br/><br/>Wang Xian, who was standing extremely far away, could only feel a violent stream of water surging over.<br/><br/>His pupils contracted slightly, and his face was filled with shock.<br/><br/>“Is it that universe overlord-level space beast? It shouldn’t be wrong.”<br/><br/>He mumbled with a look of shock in his eyes.<br/><br/>This terrifying attack was able to kill Wang Xian instantly.<br/><br/>Especially that terrifying imprisonment ability. It was as though the stream of water was completely confined within that space.<br/><br/>He took a deep breath. It was truly terrifying!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, we’ve succeeded!”<br/><br/>An lie appeared at the side.<br/><br/>“Oh no, Let’s return to the Dragon Palace immediately.”<br/><br/>However, at this moment, Wang Xian sensed an even more terrifying flow of water surging over.<br/><br/>He hurriedly shouted at an lie.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>As soon as his voice faded, his figure slowly disappeared. An lie didn’t hesitate at all as he disappeared without a trace.<br/><br/>Five seconds after they left, an incomparably huge beast swam over<br/><br/>It was like a huge octopus, with hundreds of huge tentacles.<br/><br/>The position of the head was triangular, like an extremely sharp weapon.<br/><br/>Three eyes, with a vertical eye in the middle, causing the surrounding water flow to be motionless.<br/><br/>It came here as if it was the king of this space, and everything had to follow its orders.<br/><br/>The surroundings were filled with dead silence. Only the gigantic monster was staring at them coldly.<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>He raised his tentacles one by one. Within a radius of tens of billions of kilometers, everyone looked in their direction in horror. They immediately fled in fear.<br/><br/>This aura was so powerful that it made one feel despair.<br/><br/>“Phew!”<br/><br/>At the same time, in the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian exhaled heavily.<br/><br/>An lie appeared around him and wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. “Dragon King, the life force liquid in the ancient oil lamp has bottomed out in an instant. Even if I were to slow down a little, I might end up hanging there. is that an existence on the level of the Master of the Universe?”<br/><br/>“It should be. The life force liquid in the oil lamp is also very valuable!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sighed slightly. The life force liquid was the accumulation of the Dragon Palace over the years.<br/><br/>The value aside, one or two acquired treasures could still be bought.<br/><br/>Now, all of them were gone!<br/><br/>He had sacrificed a lot in order to obtain the water lotus.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, here. This water lotus contains more energy.”<br/><br/>An lie handed over the water lotus. Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw it.<br/><br/>“Fortunately, this water lotus is very valuable. Hehe!”<br/><br/>He looked at the sixth-grade water lotus which had already grown two flower buds. A smile appeared on his face.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
