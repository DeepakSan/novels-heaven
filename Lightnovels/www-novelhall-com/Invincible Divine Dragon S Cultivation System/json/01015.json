We are no match for them at all! ”<br/><br/>“Why are these hunters and demonic beasts staring at us? Damn it, it’s hard for us to escape now! ”<br/><br/>“Saint Son Wu Man, Saint Lady Liu Yue, Saint Son Wang Xian, what should we<br/><br/>Some panicked voices came out from the mouths of the saint sons and saintesses.<br/><br/>They looked at this scene with an embarrassed expression!<br/><br/>“This is bad!”<br/><br/>Saint Son Wu Man and Saint Lady Liu Yue looked at this scene with a solemn and embarrassed expression!<br/><br/>“Kill them. It shouldn’t be a problem for each of you to deal with two of them,<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and 40 spatial swords with spatial attributes that were comparable to innate treasures floated in the air above him. Each of the sharp swords was exuding a terrifying might!<br/><br/>“Leave the four here to me. Kill them all!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said coldly. His body moved and without any hesitation, he charged towards the four hunters who were at level six of the universe Dominators on his right!<br/><br/>Although it would be difficult to fight against three to four hunters who were at a higher level as his cultivation level increased!<br/><br/>However, with the Heaven’s origin sword technique, it was not a big problem for Wang Xian!<br/><br/>In particular, he had a lot of treasures in his hands.<br/><br/>He already had 40 sharp swords that were comparable to innate supreme treasures!<br/><br/>All of these were obtained from the Void Pagoda!<br/><br/>“Brother Wang Xian, be careful! ”<br/><br/>Long Yinyin was slightly shocked when he saw Wang Xian charging towards the four masters of the sixth level. He shouted out in worry!<br/><br/>“It’s alright. They are just four demonic beasts! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and charged forward with 40 innate supreme treasures spatial swords!<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>When the four demon hunters saw Wang Xian charging towards them, they waved their sharp claws furiously and charged forward!<br/><br/>Waves of energy tore towards him!<br/><br/>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and the 40 space swords met his attack directly!<br/><br/>As he charged forward, the 40 space swords changed their positions. Waves of energy gathered and formed a sword formation in an instant!<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>“Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!”<br/><br/>The sounds of collision could be heard. After that, Wang Xian was not at a disadvantage.<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>With a wave of his arm, 18 sharp swords flew to the top of his head and started to spin, setting up sword mounds one after another!<br/><br/>Following that, a terrifying spatial sword landed in Wang Xian’s hand!<br/><br/>This was a spatial sword formed from the condensation of energy, but it contained the incomparable power of the sword principle!<br/><br/>“This… Wang Xian is actually able to fight against four people by himself?”<br/><br/>When the barbarian saint saw this scene, his eyes widened and he couldn’t help but shout out involuntarily!<br/><br/>The space attribute allowed him to fight against four of them alone!<br/><br/>This caused the barbarian saint to be extremely shocked!<br/><br/>With his talent and the treasures in his hands, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to fight against two demonic beasts of the same level!<br/><br/>However, if there were three of them, he wouldn’t be a match for them at all!<br/><br/>And now, Wang Xian was fighting against four of them directly!<br/><br/>Moreover, he wasn’t at a disadvantage at all!<br/><br/>This made him feel extremely shocked!<br/><br/>How could the strength of this saint Wang Xian be so terrifying!<br/><br/>“So Strong. Saint Wu Man, the other four of us, two each!”<br/><br/>Saintess Liu Yue looked at them in astonishment. With a move of her body, she swiftly locked onto the two hunters who were at the level six realm!<br/><br/>“Alright, Pll leave the hunters ahead to you. We’ll fend off the eight hunters who are at the level six realm! ”<br/><br/>The Barbarian Saint held the giant sword in his hand and charged forward like a thunderstorm!<br/><br/>He raised the giant sword in his hand and slashed forward like a streak of lightning!<br/><br/>“This… this Wang Xian saint is so strong. He’s actually fighting against four level six hunter demons alone! ”<br/><br/>“Yeah, he’s not at a disadvantage at all. Wang Xian saint’s sword techniques are too strong. ”<br/><br/>“He has too many treasures in his hands. These forty sharp swords are all at the level of innate supreme treasures. Oh My God, isn’t this too terrifying?”<br/><br/>An extremely shocked voice came out from the mouths of the saint sons and saintesses.<br/><br/>They saw that Wang Xian was not at a disadvantage in a one-on-four fight.<br/><br/>When they saw Wang Xian’s terrifying combat strength and the forty sharp swords at the level of innate supreme treasures, they were extremely shocked!<br/><br/>“He actually has so many spatial swords that are at the level of an innate supreme treasure. This? How is this possible? and his spatial sword technique?”<br/><br/>When the Xu Ni Saint Son and the rest of the void forbidden ground saw this scene, their eyes were filled with shock!<br/><br/>They were also filled with intense jealousy!<br/><br/>40 spatial swords that were at the level of an innate supreme treasure!<br/><br/>This was simply too crazy!<br/><br/>“What kind of inheritance did he obtain? How could he have such powerful sword techniques and so many true treasures?”<br/><br/>The Saintess of the forbidden space couldn’t help but send a voice transmission to saint son Xu Ni! (‘I don’t know! ”<br/><br/>Saint son Xu Ni also shook his head!<br/><br/>In the entire sword and magic universe, the strongest master of the space attribute was the ancestor of their forbidden space.<br/><br/>If they wanted to cultivate the strongest spatial technique, they could only do so here in the forbidden space.<br/><br/>This was publicly acknowledged by the entire universe.<br/><br/>However, a youth of the same level that was even more monstrous than them suddenly appeared.<br/><br/>He was merely an existence that came from a small forbidden space.<br/><br/>To actually have such treasures and sword techniques, how could they not be shocked and jealous!<br/><br/>“Battle, get rid of all the demonic beasts in front! ”<br/><br/>At this moment, the voice of the Saintess from the lawless forbidden land rang out as she commanded all the holy sons and Saintesses!<br/><br/>The bunch of holy sons and Saintesses immediately came back to their senses and attacked the hundreds of demonic beasts in front of them!<br/><br/>Slash! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian held the sword formation above his head and the sharp sword formed from the Heaven Origin Sword Formation. With a flash, he teleported and appeared behind a hunter demon!<br/><br/>In the sky.<br/><br/>The other 22 sharp swords were floating and attacking continuously!<br/><br/>When the demon hunter saw Wang Xian attacking him, he waved his arm.<br/><br/>His arm, which was as sharp as a blade, turned into a length of 1,000 meters and slashed at Wang Xian!<br/><br/>The sharp blade of his arm collided with Wang Xian’s sharp sword, producing a loud sound.<br/><br/>The figure of the demon hunter couldn’t help but fly backward!<br/><br/>Wang Xian saw that the space sword in his hand had also become 10,000 meters long.<br/><br/>He slashed down from above!<br/><br/>Roar!<br/><br/>It roared furiously. At the side, the other three demon hunters saw this scene and quickly helped!<br/><br/>“Bang! Bang! Bang!”<br/><br/>The 10,000-meter-long sharp sword slashed out but was blocked by the four demon hunters!<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and the sharp sword in his hand went straight for the sword!<br/><br/>The sword formation above him also shifted over rapidly!<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and the other 22 sharp swords started to teleport one by one to a certain place in the surroundings!<br/><br/>The space power in Wang Xian’s body vibrated. Waves of space power were transmitted to the sharp swords, causing them to condense into a sword tomb!<br/><br/>The four demon hunters stared at the sharp sword that was attacking them and let out a furious roar!<br/><br/>In their eyes, an energy golden light bloomed, wanting to destroy the sharp sword.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
