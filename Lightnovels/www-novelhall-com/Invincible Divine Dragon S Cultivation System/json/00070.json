He slowly opened his palm, and layers of dragon scales covered it.<br/><br/>The dragon scales emitted an eight-colored glow. With a thought, the color of the dragon scales immediately changed.<br/><br/>Eight luminaries dragon scales. This was the rule-based divine ability that Wang Xian obtained after his breakthrough.<br/><br/>This rule-based divine ability was very useful to the current Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Firstly, it was a defensive-type nomological divine ability that could greatly enhance one’s defense.<br/><br/>Secondly, the eight luminaries dragon scale could freely change the attributes of the dragon scale. In other words, Wang Xian could change his aura as he wished in the future.<br/><br/>Furthermore, when the eight attributes were mixed together, it would cause his aura to be extremely chaotic.<br/><br/>There was an advantage to this. It was to be able to get rid of the witch’s lock on him.<br/><br/>The Spellcaster’s lock-on and the Spellcaster’s curse had no effect on Wang Xian.<br/><br/>This was because the lock-on and curse required the spellcaster to possess his aura and the items on his body.<br/><br/>Since his aura had changed, it was completely impossible to lock onto him.<br/><br/>Furthermore, with his chaotic aura, even if the spellcaster possessed the items on Wang Xian’s body, he could not curse him.<br/><br/>This could also be considered as being invulnerable to all kinds of spells.<br/><br/>“With this nomological supernatural ability, I won’t be locked onto by the Wizard. However, I was ambushed this time. According to the heaven’s formation, I shouldn’t be locked onto with such precision since I have a wizard artifact that can shield my aura. Could it be that the Wizard has a magic artifact that can lock onto me?”<br/><br/>“Or… could it be that he has locked onto me through the Mi Xin Deer?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian guessed two possibilities and narrowed his eyes slightly.<br/><br/>“Next, I have to call the eight-limbed demon fiend, an lie, and the rest over.”<br/><br/>He narrowed his eyes slightly.<br/><br/>Wang Xian would definitely not let go of a force that had tried to kill him thrice.<br/><br/>It was a fight to the death.<br/><br/>Right now, his strength had already reached the peak of the divine emperor realm. Not to mention that he was invincible below the level of a universe knight, there were probably not many people in the entire universe who were stronger than him at this realm.<br/><br/>His speed was comparable to a level one universe knight. He could kill a peak of the divine emperor realm expert in an instant in a one-on-one fight.<br/><br/>With his strength, he naturally had to make the ice mountain race pay the price.<br/><br/>He moved his body and arrived at the place where Mi Xin Lu lived.<br/><br/>“Brother Wang.”<br/><br/>Mi Xin Lu was cultivating. When she saw Wang Xian, she shouted with a smile.<br/><br/>“I’ll use the room upstairs for a while. You cultivate your own. try to enter the willow deity Daoist sect to recruit disciples this time.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian instructed her with a smile. Then, he went upstairs.<br/><br/>As there might be more people coming this time, in order to prevent venerable willow deity from sensing it, he went to the periphery of the willow deity Daoist sect alone.<br/><br/>He set up a devil spirit altar and soon, the three of them walked out from the altar.<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King.”<br/><br/>The three of them bowed respectfully.<br/><br/>“How’s the situation at the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked them.<br/><br/>“Hehe, Dragon King, don’t worry with us around. We have assassinated many people from the red mist race. They are cowering in their planet and don’t dare to come out. No one dares to provoke us now.”<br/><br/>Ba Qi said with a smile.<br/><br/>“That’s good. This time, I’ll give you a mission. Ice Mountain race. You can enter this race through parasitism and obtain as much information as you can about them. I want to make a move against that ice mountain race.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said coldly.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, have you made a breakthrough in your strength?”<br/><br/>An lie asked with a face full of surprise.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded. “You know the location of the ice mountain race, an lie. Bring the eight-limbed demonic fiend and the others there. Be careful. The other party has many powerhouses at the peak of the celestial thearch level.”<br/><br/>“Don’t worry, Dragon King. Leave it to us.”<br/><br/>The eight-limbed demonic fiend and the Dragon King said confidently.<br/><br/>“Okay!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded.<br/><br/>The two level nine celestial thearch powerhouses that he killed in the ice mountain previously were used to increase the strength of the demon and the eight-limbed demon duo.<br/><br/>Both of them had the combat strength of a level nine celestial thearch.<br/><br/>“Both of you wait here first. I’ll go over first.”<br/><br/>An lie moved his body and disappeared in an instant.<br/><br/>Not long after, he returned and left with the eight-limbed demon duo.<br/><br/>“It’s best if I can get rid of the trouble of the ice mountain race within two months.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled.<br/><br/>“Eh? There are so many people outside.”<br/><br/>At this moment, he saw a large number of ships and sailboats gathered outside the willow deity Daoist sect. A large number of experts were gathered there.<br/><br/>There were also a few floating islands that were even larger than the willow deity Daoist sect.<br/><br/>“Is the willow deity Daoist sect about to start recruiting disciples?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s gaze swept over and saw countless young and middle-aged people gathering together. He muttered to himself.<br/><br/>Every thousand years, the willow deity Daoist sect would recruit disciples. This was a grand and prosperous era for many young and middle-aged people in the Milky Way region.<br/><br/>After joining the willow deity Daoist sect, the weakest one would be able to reach the eighth level of celestial thearch.<br/><br/>This was the first reason. The second reason was that one would be able to get to know more powerhouses in the sect.<br/><br/>He could even join any race he wanted. He would even be groomed as the core disciple.<br/><br/>There were many benefits to joining the willow deity sect. This resulted in the recruitment of disciples that happened once every thousand years. Countless people would come.<br/><br/>Powerful forces would also bring their disciples over.<br/><br/>Wang Xian opened the communication group of the Willow Deity sect on the universal ai and realized that many people were discussing this matter.<br/><br/>The last time the Divine Willow Daoist sect recruited disciples, none of them succeeded. This time, he didn’t know if there would be anyone.<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. Wang Xian didn’t take any action during this period. Instead, he waited for the news from the eight-limbed demonic fiend.<br/><br/>In just over ten days, they had already parasitized on the level nine divine emperor of the ice mountain race. From there, they obtained a large amount of information.<br/><br/>A level nine divine emperor was already considered a core member of the upper echelons of the ice mountain race. Now, the two of them were prepared to parasitize on the grandson of the current clan leader to see if they could obtain more core information.<br/><br/>While Wang Xian was waiting, the Willow Deity sect was also bustling with activity.<br/><br/>Not only were there more than a hundred million people on the surface of the sea surrounding the willow deity sect, there were also many disciples of the sect within.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian came to the Divine Willow Daoist sect, he only met two to three thousand disciples. He had never seen most of the rest.<br/><br/>Recently, many disciples had returned. It was obvious that they were here to watch the show.<br/><br/>There were also disciples from various races who were in the Divine Willow Daoist sect to welcome their own clansmen and the inner disciples who were participating in the assessment.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
