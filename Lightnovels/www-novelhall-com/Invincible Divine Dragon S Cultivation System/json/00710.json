Is there any connection between them?”<br/><br/>“The space beasts are different from other peak races. They live more like beasts. They hunt, grow, and Hibernate!”<br/><br/>“After the Divine Dragon Clan was destroyed, the other peak races didn’t occupy the nest of the Divine Dragon Clan? How did the Space Beasts occupy it? Is it because the space beasts are strong?”<br/><br/>“If they are strong, how did the Green River Water Phoenix manage to enter?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew rapidly in the void, his eyes shining brightly!<br/><br/>Thinking about the situation on the Divine Dragon Island, Wang Xian’s mind was filled with thoughts!<br/><br/>The leader of the ancestral dragon clan seemed to have been to the Divine Dragon Island before. After he was killed by the leader of the Holy Dragon Clan, he sent the words “Be careful of the Phoenix”!<br/><br/>There must be an important reason behind this!<br/><br/>“No matter what, the Angel tribe and Phoenix tribe will have to pay the price for besieging me this time. I Can’t attack the disciples of the Angel tribe and Phoenix tribe outside. However, there are no such rules in the Invincible Zone!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes shone with a sharp glint. He wanted to exterminate all the powerhouses of the Angel tribe and Phoenix tribe in the Invincible Zone!<br/><br/>Not a single one of them was left alive!<br/><br/>He wanted to let the two peak races know that he was not someone to be trifled with!<br/><br/>Of course, perhaps the peak races did not take the disciples in the invincible zone seriously either!<br/><br/>But that was not important!<br/><br/>What was important was that Wang Xian wanted to kill them!<br/><br/>However, just as Wang Xian was flying in the air, what happened in the trading ground was spreading at a terrifying speed in the invincible zone!<br/><br/>With the combined efforts of the experts from the angel race and the Phoenix race, there were more than 800 level 3 universe masters attacking the Dragon King!<br/><br/>In the end, seven mad demons suddenly appeared. With the Dragon King as their leader, they killed all the experts from the angel race and the Phoenix race under the Order of the Dragon King!<br/><br/>This matter was extremely sensational!<br/><br/>The entire invincible zone trembled violently!<br/><br/>“This… This actually happened when we were leaving, this is simply unbelievable!”<br/><br/>“Holy Shit, the Phoenix race and the Angel Race are allied? Over 800 universe masters with level 3 combat strength besieging the Dragon King? The seven mad demons took the Dragon King as their king and were subdued by the Dragon King? Every piece of news can cause the invincible region to boil!”<br/><br/>“The seven mad demons of the Invincible Zone have submitted to the Dragon King? They annihilated all the experts of the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan under the Order of the Dragon King? Hiss, this…”<br/><br/>“Didn’t you see that the Dragon King’s strength is the most terrifying? He could easily annihilate a mad demon. An existence at the level of a mad demon wouldn’t even have the chance to resist in front of him!”<br/><br/>“Why did the Phoenix clan’s experts ally with the Angel clan in order to take the eternal fruit? To be completely destroyed by the Dragon King, it’s too tragic. The Dragon King is an unwarable existence in the Invincible Zone!”<br/><br/>On the universe’s AI, the invincible zone was completely boiling!<br/><br/>This news was too shocking!<br/><br/>Whether it was the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan ganging up on the Dragon King!<br/><br/>Or the seven mad demons submitting to the Dragon King!<br/><br/>Or the strength that the Dragon King displayed, it caused the entire invincible region to shake!<br/><br/>In this world, there really was an invincible enemy!<br/><br/>For a time, the Dragon King became the true king of the invincible region!<br/><br/>An invincible King!<br/><br/>“HMPH!”<br/><br/>At the same time, I was at a place in the Holy Mountain of light!<br/><br/>The third Prince of the Angel race, the Angel of Light, stood in front of the throne in the palace, looking at the information on the universe ai, his face was filled with coldness!<br/><br/>On his universal AI, there was a message from Gardecker’s Angel!<br/><br/>The message was: Sooner or later, I will kill you and Rip Off Your Bird Wings!<br/><br/>When he saw this message, his eyes were filled with violent killing intent!<br/><br/>He naturally knew that this message was not sent by Gardecker’s Angel!<br/><br/>He also naturally knew that this was sent by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>“A Puny Dragon King dares to provoke me. He’s courting death!”<br/><br/>His expression was extremely cold, and his expression was somewhat ugly!<br/><br/>Especially when he learned of the situation in the invincible region.<br/><br/>He had given so many battle angels to his subordinates, and he had even taken out so many resources, and even joined forces with the Clear River Water Phoenix!<br/><br/>In the end, he was still easily killed by the Dragon King!<br/><br/>This made him furious, but at the same time, he had a new understanding of the Dragon King’s strength!<br/><br/>“After subduing seven mad demons, it’s already impossible to destroy them in the invincible zone. And this Dragon King’s combat strength is definitely not weaker than a true tier 2 ruler. He might be an existence at the level of the Five Elements Divine Dragon!”<br/><br/>The third Prince’s expression kept changing.<br/><br/>He waved his arm, and a Phoenix image appeared in front of him!<br/><br/>Ripples appeared, and a few seconds later, a figure was formed!<br/><br/>“Have you received the situation in the Invincible Zone?”<br/><br/>The third prince said to the image of the Clear River Water Phoenix!<br/><br/>“I’ve received it. Unless a master of the universe makes a move, it’s very difficult to kill it!”<br/><br/>The Clear River Water Phoenix also frowned slightly.<br/><br/>This time, it was completely out of their expectations that they didn’t succeed!<br/><br/>With the strength that the Dragon King had displayed, it was already very difficult to kill it!<br/><br/>“Do we really have to wait for the Dragon King to break through to the master level? Do We really have to wait for the Dragon Palace to reach the peak race?”<br/><br/>The third Prince said!<br/><br/>“There’s another way. Forget it. The possibility is too small. We can only wait for the Dragon Palace to reach the peak of the race!”<br/><br/>The Clear River Water Phoenix hesitated for a moment and said!<br/><br/>The third Prince raised his eyebrows and looked at her. “What’s the method you’re talking about?”<br/><br/>“The land of mountains and seas, but the method is not acceptable. Forget it.”<br/><br/>The Clear River Water Phoenix shook her head!<br/><br/>The third prince heard it and thought for a moment, but then he shook his head too!<br/><br/>There was no other way!<br/><br/>“We have to wait, I don’t know how long we will have to wait!”<br/><br/>The third prince said with some unwillingness!<br/><br/>This wait would take at least thousands of years, at most tens of thousands of years, or even more!<br/><br/>The Clear River Water Phoenix shook its head. In the current situation, they were completely helpless!<br/><br/>The Dragon King was already in power. Unless they broke the rules and made a move, they wouldn’t be able to destroy him!<br/><br/>Once they broke the rules and destroyed him, with the relationship between the Dragon Palace and the elves, they would definitely be punished!<br/><br/>The gains wouldn’t make up for the losses!<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Dragon King, there are experts from the Angel of darkness gathered at a blessed land!”<br/><br/>In the no-land zone, Wang Xian brought Wu Sha and the rest and flew quickly to the outer area!<br/><br/>Soon, Wu Sha and the rest received a piece of information and reported it to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>In the no-land zone, there were still quite a number of old monsters from the Angel Race!<br/><br/>After all, there were only a dozen or so experts from the angel race who took action this time. In the invincible zone, there were at least two to three hundred experts from the angel race, especially the Angel of Darkness!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
