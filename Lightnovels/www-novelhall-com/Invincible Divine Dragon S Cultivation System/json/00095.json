More than 10,000 great beings from Qianhai were bitten by the dark skeletons, and blood splattered everywhere. Their faces were filled with fear and despair.<br/><br/>They looked at the figure in the sky in shock, begging.<br/><br/>Universe knights were not someone they could fight against at their level.<br/><br/>“A bunch of ants, how dare they take over the territory of the Mohan clan and act so arrogantly. Do they really think that the Mohan clan, which has not appeared for over a billion years, can be offended by a bunch of Little Rascals like you?”<br/><br/>In the sky, the chief of the Mohan clan looked coldly at the group of people who were screaming in fear.<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, experts from various factions and races were being pursued by the nine peak-stage divine emperor experts of the Mohan clan.<br/><br/>They frantically fled in their surroundings.<br/><br/>Those who could directly flee back to their divine kingdoms would definitely not hesitate.<br/><br/>At this moment, they were incomparably terrified.<br/><br/>What was the situation?<br/><br/>Why would ten terrifying experts suddenly appear?<br/><br/>They claimed to be from the Mohan clan, how was this possible?<br/><br/>The Mohan clan had been destroyed for over a billion years!<br/><br/>The people on the planets around the Mohan clan fled, quickly causing a huge commotion around the Mohan clan ruins.<br/><br/>Within a few hundred light years, many powers were active around the Mohan clan ruins.<br/><br/>There were even many powers that rose up because of the Mohan clan ruins.<br/><br/>A group of races and domain level powers gathered here.<br/><br/>Now that such a huge event had happened, it caused a commotion among all the powers.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“The Grand Elder is dead, our grand elder is actually dead!”<br/><br/>In the vast territory of the Qian Hai domain level race, in the place where the life tokens were stored, an old man shouted with a face full of shock.<br/><br/>His figure flashed and he quickly flew out.<br/><br/>Soon, the news spread throughout the entire Qian Hai race.<br/><br/>In the grand hall of the Qian Hai race, the clan leader and all the great beings of the Qian Hai race were all looking at the information on the universe AI with solemn expressions.<br/><br/>At this moment, the universe AI near the ruins of the Mohan clan was completely shaken.<br/><br/>The information of nine Pinnacle god-emperor Great Beings and one universe knight terrified all the powers.<br/><br/>“They are the bloodlines left behind by the Mo Han Clan?”<br/><br/>In the center of the hall, the leader of the Qianhong clan said, his expression changing drastically.<br/><br/>The rest of the people didn’t say anything. They didn’t dare to believe this fact.<br/><br/>If they were really the bloodlines left behind by the Mo Han clan, then the sky in this starry sky would change.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Master, if they really are the bloodlines left behind by the Mo Han clan, then we now…”<br/><br/>At this moment, the ones who were the most terrified were none other than the disciples of the Red Mist clan.<br/><br/>They had received the report from their disciples, and when they saw the information on the universe AI, they felt their vision go black.<br/><br/>This was simply bad news.<br/><br/>Ever since the establishment of the Red Mist clan, there had been all sorts of things happening.<br/><br/>Now, people suspected to be the remnants of the Mo Han clan’s bloodline had appeared, this…<br/><br/>They were now a race that had been established based on the Mo Han clan’s ruins planet.<br/><br/>Now that their master had arrived, wouldn’t he be the first to tell them to scram?<br/><br/>In addition to the strength and cruelty displayed by the ten experts, if they didn’t leave this place, it was uncertain whether they would be able to survive.<br/><br/>“Hu!”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian closed his eyes and leaned on his divine seat, letting out a weak breath.<br/><br/>He had set up the red mist race with great ambition, hoping that one day he could become a powerful race in the universe.<br/><br/>However, from the beginning to the establishment of the race until now, he had suffered setbacks everywhere.<br/><br/>A dragon palace had made them cower here, not daring to come out.<br/><br/>Now, another expert from the Mohan clan had suddenly appeared.<br/><br/>This was bad news for him.<br/><br/>Escape?<br/><br/>He slowly opened his eyes, revealing a trace of powerlessness.<br/><br/>“It’s all because of the Dragon Palace. If it weren’t for them…”<br/><br/>Soon, his eyes were filled with hatred and blood.<br/><br/>“Gather all the disciples and follow me outside.”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian made a decision and said expressionlessly.<br/><br/>“Master, we…”<br/><br/>Hearing god Emperor Hong Tian’s words, the expressions of the two old men below changed slightly.<br/><br/>“Don’t worry. The other party has a universe knight level existence. It’s not something we can provoke. Go and submit to them and join them.”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian said indifferently, his expression did not change at all.<br/><br/>The expressions of the two old men below changed slightly, and they quickly nodded, “It’s master. We will immediately gather all the disciples.”<br/><br/>There were not many disciples of the red fog race, and there were only a few hundred thousand at the moment.<br/><br/>Such a small number was all thanks to the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Soon, all the disciples gathered. They followed behind God Emperor Hong Tian in surprise and teleported outside.<br/><br/>When they just appeared outside, they could smell the stench of blood in the air.<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>In the next moment, a terrifying aura covered them.<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian, who was at the front, narrowed his eyes slightly and looked up at the figure above.<br/><br/>“Oh? There are still people who don’t know what’s good for them?”<br/><br/>In the void not far away, the clan leader of the Mohan clan revealed a faint smile when he saw the group of people from the red fog race that had suddenly teleported over.<br/><br/>There was blood again.<br/><br/>He realized that the world outside was simply too beautiful.<br/><br/>If there was so much blood on their core continent, his strength might have long broken through.<br/><br/>“Greetings, sir. We are from the Red Mist race. We are a race that lives in the Mohan clan’s territory. We know that the Lord of the Mohan Clan has appeared and re-established the glory of the Mohan clan. We, the Red Mist race, are willing to be the underlings of the Mohan clan.”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian looked at the chief of the Mohan clan and felt the dense killing intent. He did not dare to hesitate and said respectfully.<br/><br/>“Oh? Hahaha, the Red Mist clan? Submit to us?”<br/><br/>When the clan leader of the Mohan clan heard their words, he suddenly laughed out loud and revealed a trace of pride on his face.<br/><br/>“Very good, very good. Submitting to our Mohan clan is your best choice. Otherwise, if you dare to occupy our territory, what awaits you is destruction.”<br/><br/>He laughed wantonly and continued.<br/><br/>“Yes, yes. With your strength, sir, you will definitely be able to recreate the glory of the Mo Han clan in the future!”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian said respectfully once more.<br/><br/>“You are very tactful. Don’t worry, there will be no lack of benefits for you in the future. Come over and tell me all about the situation in the starry sky of our Mo Han clan.”<br/><br/>The clan head of the Mo Han clan said indifferently.<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian didn’t dare to disobey. He immediately flew over and told all the powers around the Mo Han clan ruins.<br/><br/>The clan head of the Mo Han clan narrowed his eyes slightly and listened quietly by the side.<br/><br/>“Go and inform all the powers. They have been staying at my Mo Han clan for so long. Master has returned. It’s time for them to pay their respects to master.”<br/><br/>Finally, he narrowed his eyes slightly and ordered.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
