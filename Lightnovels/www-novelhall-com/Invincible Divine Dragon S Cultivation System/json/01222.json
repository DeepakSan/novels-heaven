He flew rapidly towards the starry universe!<br/><br/>When he entered the starry universe, Wang Xian called the body of the Void Divine Dragon over temporarily.<br/><br/>Wang Xian had set up quite a number of formations in the sword and Magic Universe.<br/><br/>He could teleport to the passageway instantly. The passageway could also teleport him to the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Therefore, if he rushed over or rushed over, it would only take him about ten minutes.<br/><br/>After the body of the Void Divine Dragon entered his body, Wang Xian arrived at the passageway in his complete body.<br/><br/>The passage between the nine-origin universe and the starry universe.<br/><br/>This passage was opened by a few powerful starry beasts.<br/><br/>At that time, after Wang Xian obtained the starfield fragment, he still felt an intense threat from the starry beasts, Chaos.<br/><br/>According to Wang Xian’s estimation, the chaotic feilian, Ya Ya, and Xu Shi, these starry beasts, should have reached the peak of the universe’s ruler.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it was very likely that they had touched the threshold of the Heaven’s origin realm.<br/><br/>As there were no spots for them to break through in the nine-origin universe, they opened a passageway and returned to the starry universe.<br/><br/>Wang Xian entered the starry universe. It was completely different from the previous entry.<br/><br/>The suppression of the universe had completely disappeared!<br/><br/>There was no difference between here and in the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>Here, he could also unleash his peak strength.<br/><br/>“Let’s go look for chaos. ”<br/><br/>Without the suppression of the universe, when Wang Xian entered the nine-origin universe, he would not be detected by the powerful cosmic behemoth of the Heaven’s origin creation.<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>Wang Xian channeled the power of space and continued to teleport in the direction of the boundless starry sky.<br/><br/>After a full year, Wang Xian arrived at the edge of the infinite starry sky.<br/><br/>He continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>After entering the ocean, Wang Xian continued to fly at a rapid speed.<br/><br/>After flying for a few more days, Wang Xian had already entered the infinite starry sky.<br/><br/>At this moment, he suddenly heard a terrifying roar from an extremely far distance.<br/><br/>However, this roar was getting further and further away from him.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard this voice, his eyes flickered slightly.<br/><br/>This was the voice of an existence at the Heaven’s origin level.<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not pursue the source of this voice. Instead, he continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>Soon, numerous huge mountain ranges were suspended in the void.<br/><br/>These mountain ranges were connected to one another. Each of them was the size of a planet.<br/><br/>Wang Xian saw that there were space beasts shuttling through the mountain range.<br/><br/>Moreover, there were quite a number of space beasts.<br/><br/>Wang Xian concealed his figure and continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>These space beasts at the ruler level couldn’t sense Wang Xian’s existence at all.<br/><br/>Very soon, he sensed a powerful aura.<br/><br/>This aura was somewhat familiar.<br/><br/>“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is here to pay a visit!” Wang Xian came to the front of a huge mountain and shouted!<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! ”<br/><br/>As soon as Wang Xian finished his sentence, Hun Dun’s figure appeared immediately. He looked at Wang Xian with his huge eyes and his face was filled with shock.<br/><br/>“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, you actually… actually broke through to the Heaven’s origin creation stage. The Aura on your body…”<br/><br/>Hun Dun stared at Wang Xian in disbelief.<br/><br/>From his senses, the energy in Wang Xian’s body was extremely terrifying. It was far from what an ordinary Heaven’s origin creation cosmic beast could compare to.<br/><br/>This shocked him greatly.<br/><br/>One had to know that the last time they met was not too long ago.<br/><br/>At that time, he could easily kill Wang Xian.<br/><br/>But now, under his senses, the Dragon King was like a few terrifying existences in the depths of the boundless starry sky. “Senior Hundun, long time no see.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and nodded at him.<br/><br/>Naturally, Hundun was no longer aware of what had happened in the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>Back then, when they were completely integrated into the starry sky, they would be suppressed when they entered the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>From then on, they could be considered to be completely separated from the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>“I dare not, I dare not. Lord Dragon King, you have already made a breakthrough. You can just call me hundun from now on!”<br/><br/>Hundun said hurriedly with a respectful tone.<br/><br/>Now that Wang Xian had achieved a breakthrough, he could easily kill him. Naturally, he did not dare to pretend to be a senior in front of Wang Xian. In fact, he even needed to curry favor with him.<br/><br/>“Alright, Alright. When I met you back then, you were almost able to achieve a breakthrough. It seems that the quota for the starry universe has been used up. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke to Hun Dun.<br/><br/>“Yes, this is something that we didn’t expect. ”<br/><br/>Hun Dun shook his huge head bitterly. “We entered the starry universe and initially wanted to achieve a breakthrough. However, when we reached the threshold, we realized that the quota for this universe was already full. It had already been occupied by 15 Beast Kings. ”<br/><br/>“Later on, we thought of activating our intelligence on the other starry universes in the universe. In the end, we also failed.”<br/><br/>As he spoke, he was filled with helplessness!<br/><br/>When he saw Wang Xian’s gaze, he was extremely envious.<br/><br/>“Oh? What Happened?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian revealed an astonished expression. “Just now, I sensed that there was a powerful beast king flying out of the infinite starry sky. Now that the calamity has begun, what happened?”<br/><br/>“We returned to the starry sky from the nine-origin universe. Initially, we submitted to a Beast King. Initially, we wanted to help this beast king to activate his spiritual intelligence, but in the end, we realized that it was very difficult to succeed! ”<br/><br/>“The Beast King accepted our tribute and allowed us to stay in its territory, but it didn’t communicate with us. We tried other methods to help it open its mind, but we failed.”<br/><br/>“In the end, we realized that it was impossible to help the 9-essences universe’s Space Beast Open its mind. We were born in the 9-essences universe and were nourished by the energy of the 9-essences universe, thus giving birth to our mind. ”<br/><br/>“The Space Universe has special energy. Special Energy forms a special way of thinking. The stronger the space beast, the harder it is to change its way of thinking. ”<br/><br/>“That’s why we failed. In addition, we realized that there were no more spots for us to break through. Now that the Apocalypse has begun, the universe in which we can help the Space Beasts to break through is too rare. We have never even heard of it. ”<br/><br/>Chaos replied, “As for the Beast King that left, he must have entered the chaos to look for food!”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
