They want to destroy our Phoenix clan!<br/><br/>“What should we do? Will the other Heavenly Yuan creator realm experts help us?”<br/><br/>In Phoenix Mountain, all the Phoenix clan’s disciples turned pale when they saw this scene.<br/><br/>Their faces were filled with fear.<br/><br/>Now, what should they do?<br/><br/>They looked at their emperor of the Phoenix.<br/><br/>They looked at the group of Heaven’s origin powerhouses.<br/><br/>“Emperor of the Phoenix, if you don ‘t have anything to say about the matters of the Divine Dragon Clan, just die! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at the Emperor of the Phoenix and spoke with a cold expression!<br/><br/>When the Emperor of the Phoenix heard his words, he instantly became alert. His body slowly transformed into the form of a Phoenix and the Phoenix wings all over his body exploded.<br/><br/>He did not reply to Wang Xian’s words.<br/><br/>This was because the destruction of the Divine Dragon Clan was a breach of his promise. It had a lot to do with his plan.<br/><br/>Once he lied, the surrounding Heaven’s origin powerhouses would be able to tell.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>In just a second, Wang Xian started to move.<br/><br/>The Five Elements Millstone, the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, and the body of the Void Divine Dragon started to move at the same time.<br/><br/>In an instant, Wang Xian erupted with an extremely terrifying energy. The moment this energy erupted, the fallen shadow demon Emperor’s gaze focused. A wave of energy directly enveloped the top of all the powerful disciples of the demon race and the skeleton race beside the demon race!<br/><br/>“What a terrifying power!”<br/><br/>When the Hetian saint sensed this wave of energy, his expression changed drastically. He hurriedly used the energy to envelop the saint’s lineage as well as the powerful disciples of the Divine Tiger race beside him.<br/><br/>The expressions of the elven empress and the rest changed as well. The energy enveloped their disciples.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, Pm going to fight it out with you! ”<br/><br/>When the Emperor of Phoenix saw Wang Xian attacking him, he knew that he couldn’t let this pass. He roared furiously.<br/><br/>However, he didn’t attack Wang Xian. Instead, he turned around and fled.<br/><br/>He knew that he was definitely no match for Wang Xian.<br/><br/>However, in Wang Xian’s eyes, his speed was too slow.<br/><br/>His strength was not even at the control level!<br/><br/>The gap between them was at the level of seven of the weakest heaven origin destinies.<br/><br/>The gap was huge!<br/><br/>“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP! ”<br/><br/>The Emperor of Phoenix let out a wild roar as nirvana flames bloomed all over his body.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Wang Xian was very close to the Emperor of Phoenix. The body of the Void Divine Dragon appeared in front of him almost instantly. The terrifying spatial blade slashed directly at the Emperor of Phoenix!<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s original body also appeared in front of the Emperor of Phoenix in an instant. The nine-colored Dragon Claw tore open the space in front of him and destroyed everything around him, including the space.<br/><br/>The energy that was filled with deathly stillness landed on the body of the Emperor of Phoenix.<br/><br/>“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP! ”<br/><br/>The Emperor of Phoenix felt this attack and his body trembled violently.<br/><br/>However, he could not resist at all!<br/><br/>The energy enveloped him and his vitality quickly disappeared.<br/><br/>A wisp of Nirvana fire flew out directly!<br/><br/>In the center of the Nirvana Fire, there was the appearance of a fire Phoenix!<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>The Nirvana fire ignored Wang Xian’s attack and flew out directly. It expanded in the wind and transformed into the body of the Emperor of Phoenix! His body began to turn illusory and he wanted to fly over a long distance.<br/><br/>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! ”<br/><br/>“Five elements yin-yang wind and thunder seal! ”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this scene, his entire body emitted nine-colored rays of light.<br/><br/>The nine rays of light condensed into a line and enveloped the surrounding space.<br/><br/>Under this space, all the energy was frozen!<br/><br/>It was as if time had frozen.<br/><br/>When the Emperor of Phoenix who was escaping saw this, his face was filled with despair.<br/><br/>The gap was too big.<br/><br/>Even if he unleashed his powerful trump card, he still couldn’t Dodge it!<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian let out a dragon’s roar as his dragon claws attacked the emperor of Phoenix once again.<br/><br/>Crack! Crack! Crack<br/><br/>Beneath the Emperor of Phoenix, a divine parasol tree suddenly rose from the ground to meet the dragon claws.<br/><br/>Bang<br/><br/>The dragon claws that were strong enough to kill the Emperor of Phoenix landed on the Divine Parasol Tree and the divine parasol tree collapsed. However, the Emperor of Phoenix managed to dodge this fatal attack!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, stop. Can you let our Phoenix tribe go?”<br/><br/>The Emperor of Phoenix saw Wang Xian’s invincible strength and looked to the side. The Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor and the rest did not stop him at all. At this moment, they were completely in despair!<br/><br/>He stared at Wang Xian and roared loudly with an embarrassed expression.<br/><br/>“Fine. If you die, I will let your Phoenix tribe go. You can consider it. Use Your Life to save your entire Phoenix Tribe! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at him and spoke directly!<br/><br/>It was not impossible for him to let the other powerful disciples of the Phoenix tribe go.<br/><br/>The prerequisite was that he wanted the emperor of Phoenix’s life.<br/><br/>This life was not just his life, but his origin life.<br/><br/>The kind that could be killed and completely exterminated.<br/><br/>As a veteran of the Tianyuan Destiny Realm, the Emperor of the Phoenix had an extremely deep foundation.<br/><br/>Even if Wang Xian had robbed the entire family of the Phoenix clan, he would definitely be able to revive after killing him.<br/><br/>There were definitely resurrection treasures that he had hidden in other places.<br/><br/>Some of the resurrection treasures might even be hidden in the chaos.<br/><br/>It was extremely difficult to truly kill a heaven’s origin creator!<br/><br/>“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, do you have any other conditions?”<br/><br/>The emperor of the Phoenix’s expression changed drastically when he heard this condition.<br/><br/>He stared at Wang Xian with a dark expression.<br/><br/>“Unless you die completely, all the disciples of your Phoenix clan will die. In the nine-origin universe, your Phoenix clan will no longer exist. Make your choice. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said indifferently as the corners of his mouth curled up slightly!<br/><br/>“Wishful thinking. Dragon King, you can’t kill me. As long as Pm alive, as long as Pm alive, Your Dragon Palace will not have an easy time. I will make all of you perish just like the Divine Dragon Clan in the past. ”<br/><br/>The Emperor of the Phoenix roared crazily!<br/><br/>Let him die?<br/><br/>He didn’t want to die!<br/><br/>Even if he had to sacrifice the entire Phoenix clan.<br/><br/>He couldn’t die!<br/><br/>“Hehe, what a selfish fellow. Then die. Let your entire Phoenix clan die with you!<br/><br/>Wang Xian revealed a cold expression on his face. He moved and attacked the Emperor of the Phoenix clan once again!<br/><br/>“Hahaha, this is your emperor. This is the Heaven’s destiny of your Phoenix clan. For the sake of your own lives, I will let all of you die. Then, all of you shall die! ”<br/><br/>A mocking expression appeared on Lin Niu’s face from the side.<br/><br/>His body moved, and a terrifying blood-red energy sea attacked all the powerful disciples of the Phoenix Clan!<br/><br/>“Phoenix Love Tower, what’s the point? You made your own decision back then, but you want the entire Phoenix clan to bear it. ”<br/><br/>The Shadow Devil Emperor looked at all this and shook his head as he spoke.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I will fight with Your Dragon Palace to the death. If my disciple dies, your disciple will die in the future as well. hahaha! ”<br/><br/>The Emperor of Phoenix did not respond to the fallen shadow demon Emperor’s words. Instead, he roared crazily.<br/><br/>Just now, he suffered another fatal blow from Wang Xian. However, he was resurrected by the side with a special revenge.<br/><br/>However, at this moment, he was completely aware of his ending.<br/><br/>At this moment, he was filled with hatred!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
