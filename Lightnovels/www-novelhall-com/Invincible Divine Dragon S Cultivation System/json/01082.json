It was obvious that they had some thoughts.<br/><br/>Although they were all creatures from the nine-origin universe, Wang Xian still had to pay attention to what he should pay attention to! “We want to make a deal with you, Dragon King. ”<br/><br/>The ancestral wizard in the middle looked at Wang Xian and said!<br/><br/>Wang Xian was surprised when he heard his words.<br/><br/>The ancestral wizard of the Wizard clan wanted to make a deal with him?<br/><br/>“I wonder how many seniors of the Wizard clan want to make a deal with me?” Wang Xian asked directly.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, you possess nine attributes. Now, you have a special method to enter the battlefield of the Elemental God and obtain elemental fragments. ”<br/><br/>“Our Wizard clan has a method that can lead the Elemental God into the nine-origin universe and turn it into a blessed land. We wish to use the blessed land to trade for the elemental fragments in your hands. Of course, the trade will definitely satisfy the Dragon Palace! ”<br/><br/>The ancestral wizard in the middle continued to speak!<br/><br/>“Use the blessed land to trade for the elemental fragments?”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard their words, he raised his eyebrows slightly.<br/><br/>“I wonder what attributes the ancestral wizard seniors and the other two elemental gods who are fighting together have? What elemental fragments do you want?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued to ask!<br/><br/>“The elemental gods who are fighting at the side are of the darkness and water attributes. The strength of the two elemental gods is similar to these two. We want the elemental fragments of the darkness attribute. ”<br/><br/>“The Dragon King will help us obtain all the fallen darkness elemental fragments. We can guide the two elemental gods of the darkness and water attributes into the nine-origin universe. The two blessed lands will belong to<br/><br/>Your Dragon Palace. What do you think?”<br/><br/>The ancestral wizard in the middle continued to reply!<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled when he heard his words.<br/><br/>The elemental fragments of the darkness attribute.<br/><br/>Currently, although the elemental fragment of the darkness attribute was extremely useful to the tai chi dragon disc,.<br/><br/>A small amount of elemental fragment of the darkness attribute would be of limited value to the Tai Chi Dragon Disc.<br/><br/>What he needed the most at the moment was the elemental fragment of the five elements.<br/><br/>The elemental fragment of the five elements required for the Tai Chi Dragon Disc’s breakthrough was almost complete!<br/><br/>With the elemental fragment of the water attribute, the five elements grinding could definitely complete the breakthrough.<br/><br/>There might even be some left.<br/><br/>And the Dragon Palace could obtain two powerful grotto-heavens!<br/><br/>The grotto-heavens formed by the two elemental gods were more valuable than the elemental fragments in a long-term perspective! Wang Xian had no reason to reject a lucrative deal!<br/><br/>sure!<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded. “If I can enter the middle of the battlefield between the two elemental gods, I agree to this deal! ”<br/><br/>“Alright! ”<br/><br/>The eyes of the ancestral wizard in the center lit up as he nodded with a smile.<br/><br/>This deal was initiated by them.<br/><br/>To them, it was extremely beneficial!<br/><br/>“Alright, the other battlefield has been going on for more than 10,000 years. The two elemental gods have also started to engage in close combat. I wonder when the Dragon King is planning to head over?”<br/><br/>The human-headed and snake-bodied ancestral wizard asked Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“How far is that place from here? I’ll get my men to go over and take a look first. If any elemental fragments appear, I can rush over immediately. ” Wang Xian said.<br/><br/>The elemental gods were still fighting here. He didn’t know when the elemental fragments would drop.<br/><br/>He wasn’t willing to give up on this place.<br/><br/>After all, the elemental fragments were too precious!<br/><br/>“No problem. The distance isn’t too far. When the time comes, we can make a teleportation formation for you! ”<br/><br/>An ancestral wizard said directly!<br/><br/>“That’s even better! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and nodded. Then, he looked at Lin Niu and said, “Lin Niu, follow the ancestral wizard seniors to the other battlefield of the Elemental God!<br/><br/>“Yes, Boss!”<br/><br/>Lin Niu nodded his head. He knew the strength of these ancestors.<br/><br/>“Hehe, let’s Go! ”<br/><br/>The twelve ancestors smiled and left with Lin Niu!<br/><br/>Wang Xian took a look and returned to the coverage area of the battlefield of the two elemental gods!<br/><br/>“Bang, Bang, Bang!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the sound of collision could be heard. Wang Xian saw an elemental fragment shooting towards the side!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this scene, his eyes immediately lit up with a fiery glow.<br/><br/>“This piece is very big. Since I have obtained this piece, the five elements millstone in my hand should be sufficient for me to improve. It should be sufficient for me to reach the level of the Heaven’s origin creation! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian whispered in excitement. He flew over quickly and kept it!<br/><br/>Following that, he ordered the five elements millstone to start absorbing the elemental fragments in the mother nest!<br/><br/>Once the five elements millstone completely integrated these elemental fragments, his strength would be greatly enhanced.<br/><br/>When the time came, the Dragon Palace would be able to deal with an elf queen who was at the mastery level of the Heaven’s origin creation!<br/><br/>“When my strength reaches a certain level, I will exterminate the Phoenix clan!<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself as a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.<br/><br/>Time passed by minute by minute. A year later, news came from Lin Niu.<br/><br/>It was about the situation at the other battlefield of the god of elements.<br/><br/>After Wang Xian received it, a smile appeared on his face!<br/><br/>He didn’t expect to have such a terrifying harvest not long after he came to the Chaos!<br/><br/>The harvest was too huge!<br/><br/>He also didn’t expect that his nine attributes would have such a pleasant surprise!<br/><br/>Perhaps only he could enter the battle range of the elemental gods!<br/><br/>He thought to himself.<br/><br/>A few hundred years later, the twelve ancestral sorcerers came again and set up a teleportation formation at the side!<br/><br/>Wang Xian and Ling Linniu tried the teleportation formation to avoid any special situations.<br/><br/>After all, he was not particularly familiar with the twelve ancestral sorcerers. He still had to make some preparations!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, let’s take a look at the other battlefield of the god of elements! ” One of the ancestral witches said to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head and arrived at the other battlefield of the god of elements through the teleportation formation!<br/><br/>His eyes lit up when he saw the battle ahead.<br/><br/>There were already a few shimmering elemental fragments in this battlefield.<br/><br/>These fragments might be absorbed by the god of elements again after a long period of time!<br/><br/>Therefore, it didn’t mean that he would be able to obtain these elemental fragments after the battle ended!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, you should be able to enter it, right?” The ancestral wizard with pale pupils looked at Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“Let me give it a try! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved his body. The water and darkness attributes on his body were constantly interweaving and circulating!<br/><br/>His body came to the edge of the aftermath of the battle.<br/><br/>When he entered, he was not attacked.<br/><br/>He was safe and sound..
