His strength is the strongest in our nine-origin universe and he has already reached the level of Great Dao. ” The Elven empress spoke to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>The Elven Empress ‘words made Wang Xian slightly surprised.<br/><br/>He didn’t expect that the strongest person in the Heaven’s origin creation level was actually the demon race.<br/><br/>The demon race was relatively low-key in the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>Just now, when they were having a dispute, this fallen Shadow Demon Emperor was also among them, but he didn’t say anything!<br/><br/>“Yes, the Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor is the strongest. What you saw just now was one of his avatars. His avatars had just entered the Heavenly Yuan creation realm. ”<br/><br/>“As for his original body, it should be cultivating in the chaos to find treasures. Besides the Shadow Devil Emperor, there are three people at the control realm. I am one of them. There are also the Dark Clan’s Heavenly Yuan creation realm and the Black Tortoise clan’s. ”<br/><br/>“The rest are all at the initial stage. However, there are strong and weak at the initial stage. The Great Dao realm does not mean that one can kill the initial stage of the Heavenly Yuan creation realm. Some initial stage heavenly Yuan Creation Realm Warriors can fight two people at the same level alone. ”<br/><br/>“This is the old beginner level Tianyuan creation. Only the old Great Dao level can destroy this kind of Tianyuan creation. In short, the gap between the Tianyuan creation is not like the ruler realm, where one level higher can easily kill one level weaker than oneself. ”<br/><br/>“Like the Emperor of Phoenix and the Emperor of angels, they are both at the beginner level of Tianyuan creation. They can fight and escape even if they fight two people alone! ”<br/><br/>“Of course, this is my understanding of them in the past. I don’t know if they have improved or not. However, I believe that they have not reached the level of control! ”<br/><br/>The Elven empress gave Wang Xian a detailed introduction.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head.<br/><br/>The strength of the nine-origin universe was already very powerful!<br/><br/>There was even one at the Great Dao level!<br/><br/>There were also three at the control level!<br/><br/>One must know that one great dao level cultivator could easily fight against nine beginner level cultivators.<br/><br/>In other words, if the nine-origin universe wanted to destroy the sword and magic universe, it would be a piece of cake!<br/><br/>And with their powerful strength, after the calamity began, they could completely occupy other universes and obtain some spots to break through!<br/><br/>For example, the nine-origin universe had nine elements of the heavenly fate.<br/><br/>Then, after all nine spots of the heavenly fate were occupied, the disciples of the nine origin universe could go to other universes to break through.<br/><br/>Of course, it didn’t mean that every universe had nine spots.<br/><br/>For example, in the belief universe, the disciples of the nine origin universe wouldn’t be able to break through to the heavenly fate realm.<br/><br/>Because the cultivation system was different, because that universe didn’t have the elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.<br/><br/>As such, it didn’t support the experts with the attributes of metal, wood, water, fire, and Earth to break through!<br/><br/>Once the calamity erupted, it would be a disaster for those weak universes!<br/><br/>“Thank you for informing me, senior elven empress. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thanked the elven empress.<br/><br/>“Hehe, there’s no need. It’s really out of my expectations for you to be able to reach this step. The fusion of the nine attributes into one, and before you reach the Heaven’s origin realm of Destiny, you already possess the Heaven’s origin power of Destiny. This is enough for you to protect yourself. ”<br/><br/>“It’s enough for the Dragon Palace to establish itself in the entire nine-origin universe. ”<br/><br/>The Elven empress smiled and shook her head, then said, “Alright, I’m going to go to the chaos around the tree of chaos and see if I can find any treasures!”<br/><br/>“The place where the tree of chaos appears usually has treasures. You can also go there to look for them, but you have to be careful. There’s nothing like what you imagine in the chaos, only dead silence. There are also some dangerous environments. ”<br/><br/>“For example, some terrifying chaotic storms that can cause the fate of the Heaven’s origin to perish.”<br/><br/>The Elven empress reminded.<br/><br/>“Thank you for Your Reminder, senior elven empress. I will take note of it! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded.<br/><br/>“Yes, that’s right! ”<br/><br/>The Elven empress nodded, suddenly, she looked at Wang Xian and said, “In our nine-origin universe, the Wizard clan is very special. The combined strength of the twelve ancestors of the Wizard clan is very terrifying. Under the heaven-revolving formation, they are able to resist the fate of the Heaven’s origin at the control level. Their bodies are rather special. Their lifespans are one more calamity than those below the ordinary fate of the Heaven’s origin.<br/><br/>In the last calamity battle, they killed a fate of the Heaven’s origin! ”<br/><br/>“You should pay attention to the Wizards. It’s best not to provoke them. Their attacks are very strange. ”<br/><br/>“Also, don’t provoke the Hetian Sage in the nine-origin universe. The Hetian Sage has received the recognition of the universe’s Al. This is a terrifying treasure at the Heavenly Yuan creation level. Although it’s auxiliary and has almost no destructive power, the Hetian Sage uses the universe’s Al. In the nine-origin universe, those at the control level can’t do anything to him! ”<br/><br/>“However, the Hetian saint is not bad. He cares about the living beings of the nine-origin universe and is more fair and considerate of the overall situation. ” After the elven empress said these two points, she left immediately!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard the last two pieces of information, he revealed a look of astonishment!<br/><br/>The Wizard clan?<br/><br/>The twelve ancestors of the Wizard clan working together was actually so terrifying?<br/><br/>To be able to receive such a high evaluation from the elven empress.<br/><br/>There was also the unity saint.<br/><br/>The lineage of the saint was established after the last calamity.<br/><br/>The Unity Saint had also broken through after the calamity. With the help of the universe’s Al, his strength had soared!<br/><br/>“A heaven origin creation-level weapon is still powerful! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sighed slightly.<br/><br/>The universe’s Al was the only publicly announced heaven origin creation-level treasure in the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>He did not expect that the Hetian Sage could actually control some of it.<br/><br/>It was rumored that this heaven origin creation treasure was controlled by a group of heaven origin creation powerhouses.<br/><br/>Clearly, there were some differences!<br/><br/>After listening to the Elven empress ‘explanation, Wang Xian had a complete understanding of the nine-origin universe!<br/><br/>Currently, although the Dragon Palace had two heaven origin creation treasures, they were still not the strongest.<br/><br/>Not to mention the Great Dao level fallen Shadow Devil Emperor.<br/><br/>The heaven origin fortunes of the Xuanwu clan, the Elven empress, and the Netherworld race were all able to fight against Wang Xian and Lin Niu!<br/><br/>As Lin Niu had obtained the Agar Heavenly Demon God, he should be considered as a veteran who had just entered the heaven origin fortunes!<br/><br/>Overall, he and Lin Niu could fight against those at the control level!<br/><br/>Especially if they were separated, their mobility and threat would be higher!<br/><br/>More terrifying!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
