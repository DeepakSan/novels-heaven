God Emperor Hong Tian stood in front of the divine seat. The origin magnetic light ring above his head rotated, emitting a red luster.<br/><br/>A terrifying aura spread out from his body towards the surroundings.<br/><br/>At the same time, all the disciples of the red fog race below were shouting excitedly. Similarly, an aura soared into the sky.<br/><br/>“Hehe, very domineering!”<br/><br/>At the front, the three top domain-level experts felt this terrifying aura. A hint of seriousness flashed across their eyes. Their bodies also emitted waves of aura as they tried to defend themselves.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest narrowed their eyes slightly. The Yin-yang Dragon disk appeared around him to defend against this power.<br/><br/>“These guys are really arrogant. Are they trying to show off their strength to all the races?”<br/><br/>Ba Qi and the rest could not help but complain. Their eyes flashed as they swept across all the experts from the red fog race.<br/><br/>From the waves of power, they could sense the strength of all the experts from the red fog race.<br/><br/>There were three rank nine divine emperors, nearly 20 rank eight divine emperors, and more than 100 rank seven divine emperors.<br/><br/>There were more than 53,000 divine emperors and above.<br/><br/>The strongest one was still god Emperor Hong Tian. That mighty aura made many experts of the races break out in cold sweat.<br/><br/>“I didn’t expect God Emperor Hong Tian to have accumulated such a strong foundation. He’s too strong!”<br/><br/>“He’s not any weaker than the other domain-level races. In addition, they belong to the Magus lineage. The red fog race is able to rank in the top five of our Starry Sky Forces!”<br/><br/>“So Strong!”<br/><br/>At the back, the experts of the various races felt this power and their expressions changed slightly.<br/><br/>“Hehe, when our red fog race was first established, we recruited experts from all walks of life. First of all, let me introduce to everyone the experts who have joined our red fog race.”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian was very satisfied when he saw this scene. He continued to speak indifferently.<br/><br/>“I am Dan Lun of the red fog race. Greetings to all of You!”<br/><br/>“Red fog race’s violent mountain giant. Greetings to all of you!”<br/><br/>“A group of elite core disciples from the three-eyed race have joined the red fog race. Greetings to all of you!”<br/><br/>“A group of elite core disciples from the four-armed race have joined the red fog race. Greetings to all of You!”<br/><br/>Experts walked out from the back and stood to the left and right of God Emperor Hong Tian.<br/><br/>“Master Danlun has actually joined the red fog race. Hiss, God Emperor Hong Tian has actually invited Master Danlun to join!”<br/><br/>“Master Danlun is a ninth level God emperor expert and is skilled in alchemy. His disciples number in the tens of thousands and all of them are powerful alchemists.”<br/><br/>“It must be divine emperor Hong Tian who lured Master Danlun and the others over with that Divine Garden Star.”<br/><br/>“The Explosive Mountain Giants have also joined the Red Mist tribe. Although there are only tens of thousands of them, each of them has the combat strength of a divine emperor when they reach adulthood. The leader of the Explosive Mountain Giants now has the combat strength of a rank nine divine emperor!”<br/><br/>“Isn’t the three-eyed tribe and the four-armed tribe the two great tribes that they disbanded after being defeated by the Dragon Palace? They have actually joined the Red Mist tribe. Although most of the elites of the two great tribes have been killed, they still possess quite a number of foundations.”<br/><br/>Shocked voices sounded from around them. When they saw the experts who had joined the Red Mist tribe one after another, even the Pangshan tribe and the others in front revealed solemn expressions.<br/><br/>To directly establish a strength at the peak of this starry sky, the strength of the Hong Tian Celestial Emperor could be seen.<br/><br/>“Three-eyed tribe, four-armed tribe!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian, Ba Qi, and the others saw these two tribes, they raised their eyebrows slightly.<br/><br/>These two tribes had a deep hatred towards the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“I, the Hong Tian Celestial Emperor, am very honored to be able to invite master Dan Lun and the Explosive Mountain Giant to join the Red Mist tribe. In the future, our Red Mist tribe will sell all kinds of medicinal pills. I hope that all of you can show us your face!”<br/><br/>“Other than the medicinal pill business, our red fog race also carries out the war pet business!”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian stood in front with a smile on his face.<br/><br/>As he spoke, he waved his arm.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>Roars came from the back.<br/><br/>The aura of the wilderness charged over.<br/><br/>The might caused everyone’s gaze to freeze.<br/><br/>In the middle was a level eight divine emperor desolate beast. It had two huge heads and its body was over 10,000 meters in size.<br/><br/>A violent aura came from its body.<br/><br/>Level eight divine emperor desolate beast, double roar!<br/><br/>Around this desolate beast, there were more than a dozen level seven divine emperor desolate beasts.<br/><br/>“This is? A battle pet tamed by the Hong Tian Divine Emperor?”<br/><br/>“A celestial emperor level eight battle pet, this… how is this possible!”<br/><br/>“Hiss, a celestial emperor level eight battle pet, this is too terrifying!”<br/><br/>Everyone looked at the ten thousand over battle pets, their faces filled with shock.<br/><br/>There were more than ten thousand celestial emperor level battle pets, and one of them was a celestial emperor level eight battle pet.<br/><br/>One had to know that the top races only had celestial emperor level eight experts overseeing them.<br/><br/>Now, they were actually selling eighth level divine emperor battle pets. How terrifying!<br/><br/>When everyone saw this scene, their faces revealed an extremely shocked expression.<br/><br/>Even the three domain level race experts at the very front had a slight change in expression.<br/><br/>The battle pet business was a big business in the entire universe.<br/><br/>There were even powerful races that enslaved some demonic beast races and sold them.<br/><br/>The red fog race actually had more than 10,000 god Emperor level war pets, causing them to be extremely shocked.<br/><br/>“These are the more than 10,000 god Emperor level war pets of our red fog race. They will be sold from today onwards!”<br/><br/>“In addition, our red fog race will open up a planet that I have broken through and create a commercial planet there!”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian continued to speak as he created momentum for the red fog race.<br/><br/>The items that he brought out and the foundation that he displayed shocked all the factions.<br/><br/>“Congratulations, God Emperor Hong Tian. We will definitely support you in the future!”<br/><br/>“Congratulations on the establishment of the Red Fog clan. In the future, with God Emperor Hong Tian leading the Red Fog clan, they will definitely sweep across the entire region!”<br/><br/>The experts from the various races and races immediately bowed respectfully.<br/><br/>Some of the experts from the races spoke even more respectfully.<br/><br/>After all, just the battle pets sold by the red fog race could be comparable to or even surpass their strongest experts. They naturally had to be respectful!<br/><br/>“Haha, Thank You Very Much. Our red fog race is also willing to be friends with all of you and live in harmony!”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian laughed loudly and said.<br/><br/>When the experts from the other factions heard this, they heaved a sigh of relief in their hearts.<br/><br/>“However, when our red fog clan was first established, we still have to settle some matters and settle some grudges!”<br/><br/>All of a sudden, God Emperor Hong Tian changed the topic and his tone was filled with coldness.<br/><br/>His words made the hearts of some of the weaker races and domain-level races tremble slightly as they revealed nervous expressions.<br/><br/>What was going on?<br/><br/>Someone had offended God Emperor Hong Tian?<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian and the rest heard God Emperor Hong Tian’s words and recalled the expressions of some of the red fog race’s disciples, they suddenly had a bad feeling.<br/><br/>They narrowed their eyes slightly.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
