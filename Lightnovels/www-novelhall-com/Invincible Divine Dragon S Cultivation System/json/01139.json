I was raised by you and my mother since I was young. My mother and you are the closest people in my life. ”<br/><br/>“And I also know that you are genuinely good to me and want to protect me. ” Tianci listened to Wang Xian’s words and spoke to him seriously.<br/><br/>He would not forget that when he was just born, his cultivation speed was slow.<br/><br/>It was his foster father who told him that he was born extraordinary.<br/><br/>He taught him how to cultivate the wood attribute.<br/><br/>He would never forget that it was his foster father who taught him when he encountered some problems.<br/><br/>Not to mention that everything his foster father did was for his own good.<br/><br/>If not for his foster father, he would have been discovered and killed by some experts.<br/><br/>In addition, with the improvement of his strength and the growth of the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan in his body, he also knew why he was so close to his foster father since he was young.<br/><br/>That was because he vaguely felt that there was a treasure of the same attribute in his foster father’s body.<br/><br/>Now that he had grown up, he could think of many problems clearly!<br/><br/>“Hehe, let’s Go! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and brought Tianci along as they flew towards the source of water.<br/><br/>“Foster father, is this the source of Fire? We actually came here directly. This place is very far away from the source of water!”<br/><br/>“Foster Father, your speed is so fast and terrifying. When did I have such a fast<br/><br/>“Oh no, foster father. More than a dozen of my classmates and I are going to hunt elemental beasts. What should we do now?”<br/><br/>Sitting on the back of the Unicorn, Tianci scanned the surroundings and spoke in shock!<br/><br/>“I will settle the matter of your experiential learning. When the time comes, just transfer some of your memories directly into the minds of your classmates. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian replied to tianci! “Modify my memories? Is it that powerful?”<br/><br/>Tianci asked in surprise.<br/><br/>“As long as one cultivates this type of ability, it’s very easy for the strong to use it on the weak. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head.<br/><br/>“There’s also this kind of ability. It’s a little scary. Foster father, what if someone tampers with my memory?”<br/><br/>“That won’t happen. You have the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation in your body. Even the powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin creation would go crazy to obtain such a treasure. With your current strength, even the powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin creation wouldn’t be able to tamper with your memory. The Ultimate Treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation in your body has some ability to protect yourself. ”<br/><br/>Tianci chatted with Wang Xian as they flew towards the source of water quickly.<br/><br/>The distance from here to the source of water was still very far. It would take at least a month.<br/><br/>This was under the condition of using the teleportation formation midway.<br/><br/>Tianci and the rest had been training for ten years. Hence, this one month didn’t affect them much!<br/><br/>“Damn it, damn it. The Ultimate Treasure of Tianyuan is actually in the body of a young man. It has completely merged with that young man. The Ultimate Treasure of Tianyuan was born and merged with a young man! ”<br/><br/>“There are actually two powerful experts of the Heaven’s origin beside him. What are those two experts of the Heaven’s origin doing? Why didn’t they take the treasure away directly?”<br/><br/>While Wang Xian and the rest were hurrying on their way, they were in a universe at the same time.<br/><br/>The center of the huge basin was enveloped by bright energy.<br/><br/>In the sky, there were countless light elves flying.<br/><br/>An old man was sitting cross-legged in the center of the basin.<br/><br/>The old man’s body was illusory and gradually began to solidify.<br/><br/>He let out a low voice and his expression was extremely ugly.<br/><br/>He was an existence at the light-attributed Tianyuan level who had just been killed by Wang Xian and the rest.<br/><br/>After his death, he was resurrected in his own universe!<br/><br/>This resurrection had caused him to pay a huge price.<br/><br/>Furthermore, his corpse was also a huge resource.<br/><br/>Within that corpse, there were two of his weapons.<br/><br/>One was a heavenly fate fragment, and the other was a powerful weapon.<br/><br/>They were all his treasures, but now, they were all gone.<br/><br/>Now, even if he completely recovered, he wouldn’t be able to return to his peak combat strength.<br/><br/>“The heavenly fate treasure can’t be let off like this. Right now, the surroundings of the six paths universe are all guarded by other heavenly fate powerhouses. They have all sorts of powerful detection methods, so it should be difficult for them to bring their treasures out. ”<br/><br/>“However, their strength is much stronger than mine. I’m not their match at all. ”<br/><br/>He muttered. His expression changed as he kept thinking. “Looks like Pll have to find some helpers.”<br/><br/>He was silent for dozens of minutes before he spoke.<br/><br/>He wasn ‘t his match. He could only find other heaven origin creation realm warriors to cooperate with.<br/><br/>This was something that couldn’t be helped.<br/><br/>“We’re here. Tianci, continue your training. Come and look for me after it’s<br/><br/>A month later, Wang Xian and the rest came to the water source again.<br/><br/>He spoke to tianci. “Yes, yes, Foster Father!”<br/><br/>Tianci nodded his head.<br/><br/>After that, Wang Xian left immediately while Lin Niu continued to follow tianci.<br/><br/>However, this time, Wang Xian did not leave too far away in order to prevent any accidents from happening.<br/><br/>Instead, he came to a location not too far away from Heaven’s gift.<br/><br/>There was no difference between returning to his temporary residence and staying here.<br/><br/>When he came to the bottom of the sea, Wang Xian moved his palm and the corpse of the Radiant Heaven’s origin creation expert appeared in front of him.<br/><br/>“Light attribute. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. “Furthermore, it’s an old-fashioned Radiant<br/><br/>Heaven’s origin creation expert. ”<br/><br/>He moved his palm and searched through the corpse. He found a spatial item.<br/><br/>In this spatial item, Wang Xian found a piece of the Heaven’s origin destiny realm fragment, which was the divine bell of light.<br/><br/>There was also a staff and some resources of the light attribute.<br/><br/>There weren’t many resources, but the value of the staff of light and the Heaven’s origin destiny realm fragment was extremely high!<br/><br/>The staff was obviously forged from treasures found in the chaos. It couldn’t be compared to innate treasures.<br/><br/>“Now that I have obtained the corpse of an old Tianyuan fate powerhouse with the light attribute and a staff, can the Taiji Dragon Plate achieve a breakthrough?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was looking forward to it.<br/><br/>The last time, the Taiji Dragon Plate had absorbed a large amount of resources and treasures. Even with the corpse of a Tianyuan fate powerhouse, it was still unable to achieve a breakthrough.<br/><br/>This time, after absorbing another one, it should be able to make a breakthrough, right?<br/><br/>Once he made a breakthrough, Wang Xian’s combat strength would be able to increase by quite a lot.<br/><br/>“It’s not easy to obtain the corpse of a heaven origin creator. It’s definitely extremely precious. ”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, he took out the Tai Chi Dragon Plate and started to devour it!<br/><br/>Following that, he sized up this god of light clock.<br/><br/>After sizing it up, he gained some understanding.<br/><br/>This divine clock of light was a treasure that could be used for defense and trapping humans. Its power was similar to the fragments of the Starfield.<br/><br/>It was weaker than the book of Water Forbidden Spell.<br/><br/>The book of water forbidden spell in Wang Xian’s hands was two-thirds of the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
