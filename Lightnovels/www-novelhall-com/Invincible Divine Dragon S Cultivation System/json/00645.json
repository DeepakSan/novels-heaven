Life Sound Arrow also cupped his hands to show his respect to these two powerhouses!<br/><br/>Clearly, their strength was much stronger than Life Sound Arrow’s!<br/><br/>The powerhouses from the top races entered the reception room of the auction one after another. This was an eye-opener for the powerhouses’disciples from the high-level races around!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, we detected that there are powerhouses hiding in the surroundings. They are very strong!”<br/><br/>There was only one day left before the auction started. Prime Minister GUI reported to Wang Xian after reading the information from the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>“Can you find out who the powerhouses are?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked!<br/><br/>“We sent the powerhouses to take a look. They should be from the Angel clan. The other powerhouses should be some of the top powerhouses in the invincible zone. They are comparable to the old scholar, the Tai Shui Demon King and the rest!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui replied!<br/><br/>Some of the powerhouses had already arrived. However, they didn’t want to see the road, so they hid in the surroundings!<br/><br/>“How many top-notch experts are there now?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked him!<br/><br/>“There should be around 35 experts from various peak races, including some old monsters from the invincible zone. I wonder if there are more experts hiding in the surroundings.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister GUI reported!<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head slightly!<br/><br/>35 experts with at least level four combat strength, the ruler of the universe, was already a huge number!<br/><br/>One must know that many masters represented not only himself but also his family and friends. It could be a circle of masters from their peak races!<br/><br/>“I can sell three soul returning embryo fruits. I can’t sell any more.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself!<br/><br/>Treasures of this level were too precious. If he took too many of them, it might attract the covetous eyes of the Masters!<br/><br/>“Wang Xian, my father and grandfather are here. I need to go and welcome them!”<br/><br/>At this moment, Ling Honggu flew over and said to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“Oh? Are you here? Let’s Go Together!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was slightly taken aback. Then, he said with a smile on his face!<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>Ling honggu nodded with a smile. The two of them moved and flew out!<br/><br/>“Eh? This Is?”<br/><br/>When he and Ling Honggu flew out, his gaze focused slightly and landed on the old man beside the Spirit Demon King!<br/><br/>The old man was extremely tall and sturdy. At this moment, his aura was restrained.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian could tell at a glance that he was an expert at the level of a universe dominator!<br/><br/>Furthermore, his strength was also higher than the sound of life arrow. As for the exact level, he couldn’t tell!<br/><br/>While Wang Xian was sizing him up, the old man was also sizing up Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“Not bad, not bad. Dragon King, right? He’s very strong and has great potential!”<br/><br/>The old man smiled at Wang Xian and commented!<br/><br/>“Sir, I’m impressed!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian cupped his hands and looked at Ling Honggu at the side.<br/><br/>He didn’t expect Ling Honggu to have such a terrifying grandfather!<br/><br/>This person should be an expert of the skeleton race!<br/><br/>Among the peak races, in a one-on-one situation, it was best not to provoke the skeleton race!<br/><br/>Because you did not know whether it was a 1v1 or 1V9999999999.<br/><br/>There was a well-known thing in the universe, that was not to engage in a 1v1 PK with the skeleton race!<br/><br/>Because they might summon an army of skeletons!<br/><br/>Even if the angels of the angel race could summon an army of angels, one had to consider how many armies this skeleton king had.<br/><br/>The Skeleton King who was above the level of a universe dominator would definitely have his own skeleton army!<br/><br/>“Spirit Demon King, this way please!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian extended his hand and gestured for them to enter the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>“HMM? That’s an expert from the skeleton clan. This Dragon King of the Dragon Palace not only has a good relationship with the Elf clan, but he also has a good relationship with a king from the skeleton clan?”<br/><br/>“Which King from the skeleton clan is this? His strength is much stronger than mine!”<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, the experts from the peak races looked over with sparkling eyes.<br/><br/>Wang Xian brought the spirit demon king and the rest to the Dragon King’s palace. After inviting them to a banquet, they chatted for a while!<br/><br/>They also had a brief understanding of the grandfather of the Spirit Red Bone!<br/><br/>He was a king of the skeleton clan.<br/><br/>With the relationship between the spirit red bone and his grandfather, the grandfather of the spirit red bone was very polite to Wang Xian and even admired him very much.<br/><br/>After all, it was all thanks to Wang Xian that the spirit red bone was able to reach this stage!<br/><br/>“The auction is about to begin. Lord Sound of Life Arrow, Lord Black Vulture King, everyone, let’s head over!”<br/><br/>The auction was about to begin. Wang Xian called out to his grandfather, the black vulture king, and the sound of life arrow as they flew towards the auction venue!<br/><br/>“Hehe, Alright, Alright.”<br/><br/>The sound of life arrow smiled and nodded his head!<br/><br/>These few days, Wang Xian had treated the elves very well!<br/><br/>Putting everything else aside, he took out two soul-returning embryo fruits and gifted them to the sound of life arrow!<br/><br/>However, the sound of life arrow didn’t take advantage of him. He traded some extremely precious fruits and spiritual herbs with it!<br/><br/>Of course, although the treasures that the sound of life arrow took out were precious, in terms of rarity, the soul returning embryo fruit was naturally incomparable!<br/><br/>As for Red Spirit Bone’s grandfather, he took out the darkness attribute innate true treasure in his hand and sold it to him at a low price.<br/><br/>Ling Honggu’s grandfather rejected him. He said that if he wanted it, he would bid for it!<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled at this and didn’t continue to be polite!<br/><br/>The resources in Wang Xian’s hands were enough for him to level up!<br/><br/>If it wasn’t enough, there was still an auction to be held. After the auction, he would break through directly!<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>Roar! Roar! Roar<br/><br/>When Wang Xian and the rest flew toward the auction venue, divine dragons, berserk dragon species, halberd dragon guard, and imperial dragon species flew out from the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>Twenty pure-blooded divine dragons, led by bei Shuang!<br/><br/>Other than them were AO qitian, Ao Qi, ao Yasha, and the rest of the peak-tier close-combat dragon species. Each of them exuded the combat strength of A Level 3 universe dominator!<br/><br/>There were a total of 100 level 3 universe overlords, and every one of them had a terrifying aura!<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, some peak-tier race warriors looked over in surprise, their eyes shining!<br/><br/>“20 pure-blooded dragons, and the rest are all peak-tier races. This Dragon Palace really lives up to its name!”<br/><br/>“Amazing, that should be the frost dragon. It’s much easier for mutated pure-blooded dragons to break through the shackles of a ruler. It seems that the Dragon Palace really has the possibility to step into the peak-tier race!”<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace’s current strength is comparable to a dragon king who wasn’t weak at the peak of the Divine Dragon Clan. There are a lot of peak-level dragon species. I heard that they even have a thorned dragon species. That’s a terrifying existence!”<br/><br/>The experts from the five or six peak-level species looked on in shock.<br/><br/>As for the peak-level disciples who hadn’t broken through to the ruler realm, they were even more shocked!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
