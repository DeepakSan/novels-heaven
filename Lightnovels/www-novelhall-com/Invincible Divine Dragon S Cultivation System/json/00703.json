They quickly surrounded the entire trading ground from all directions!<br/><br/>Their bodies were emitting a powerful aura that made people’s hearts palpitate!<br/><br/>“Eh? What’s going on? What a powerful aura. More than a hundred experts from the Phoenix clan. Are they also here to buy ordinary fruit?”<br/><br/>“It should be. However, it’s very rare to see more than a hundred phoenixes gathered together!”<br/><br/>When they walked toward the inner area of the trading ground, some experts saw them and asked in puzzlement!<br/><br/>However, they didn’t pay too much attention to it. After all, the Dragon King was selling the fruits now, so it was normal for some experts to come and buy them!<br/><br/>“All of you, move out and approach the trading area. If we approach at the same time, we will definitely attract the attention of the Dragon King. If he wants to escape, just take action and pin him down. We must not let him escape!”<br/><br/>Huo Min Tian looked at the information in his hands and immediately gave an order on the universe ai!<br/><br/>He looked at senior Huo Ying beside him and nodded slightly as a sign of acknowledgment!<br/><br/>They moved and flew quickly towards the trading ground.<br/><br/>Their speed was very fast and they could not hide the power on their bodies. However, at this moment, there was no need to hide their power!<br/><br/>With the Dragon King’s strength, as long as they got close, he would be able to sense them immediately. Therefore, there was no need to hide!<br/><br/>From all directions, a group of powerhouses from the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan flew over in an encirclement formation<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>In the trading ground, Wang Xian was sitting leisurely. Suddenly, he felt waves of energy from all directions flying over rapidly!<br/><br/>Those who could emit such energy were definitely not weaklings!<br/><br/>His eyes flickered slightly as he looked around.<br/><br/>There must be a reason why so many powerhouses were flying over in such a manner.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly as he scanned his surroundings with a smile on his face!<br/><br/>“HMM? That Dragon King should have sensed our arrival but didn’t have any reaction. Is He that confident?”<br/><br/>Gardner Angel and the rest, who were surrounding them from all directions, sensed that Wang Xian didn’t move and revealed a surprised expression on their faces!<br/><br/>Logically speaking, they should have been alerted by such a terrifying attack.<br/><br/>However, the Dragon King did not move at all, as if he did not sense them!<br/><br/>It was also as if he did not care about them at all!<br/><br/>“Arrogant!”<br/><br/>Gardecker’s Angel’s eyes revealed a cold expression as he stared ahead.<br/><br/>“Boom Boom Boom!”<br/><br/>Following that, numerous powerful figures flew over. The group of Old Monsters, who had not left yet, sensed the majestic energy and revealed wary expressions!<br/><br/>“What’s the situation? A large number of experts are flying over!”<br/><br/>“A large number of experts are flying over from all directions. What’s the situation?”<br/><br/>“The situation isn’t right. Experts are coming from all directions. They are surrounding us. What are these guys trying to do?”<br/><br/>On the land of the trading ground, the group of old monsters looked around and frowned as they roared in a low voice!<br/><br/>These waves of energy were extremely terrifying. It made them feel a little terrified!<br/><br/>“You’re not weak at all!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sat there and swept his gaze across the surroundings. He said with a faint smile!<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>At the spot in front of him, waves of terrifying fire energy dyed the entire void red. Two gigantic fire phoenixes flapped their wings and flew towards him!<br/><br/>“CHIRP CHIRP!”<br/><br/>From behind him, a phoenix cry sounded. A large number of water phoenixes flapped their wings and flew towards him!<br/><br/>Behind the dozens of water phoenixes, a gigantic water phoenix totem rose. This water phoenix totem was really incomparable. It flapped its wings and contained a terrifying aura!<br/><br/>From the left, right, and other directions, the experts from the angel race and other races flew towards him!<br/><br/>As they approached, all the powerhouses locked onto Wang Xian’s position on the trading ground!<br/><br/>“Eh? What’s going on? The powerhouses from the Phoenix race of the angel race, what are they doing?”<br/><br/>“They are coming for the Dragon King. From the looks of it, it doesn’t seem like they are buying the everlasting fruit.”<br/><br/>“They have completely sealed off the surrounding space. They are prepared!”<br/><br/>When the experts on the trading ground saw this scene, their expressions changed slightly. They looked at Wang Xian!<br/><br/>Some of the experts were afraid of being affected and flew out!<br/><br/>The experts from the Phoenix and Angel clans did not stop them!<br/><br/>“They are here to deal with the Dragon King. Could it be that they are here to take the eternal fruit?”<br/><br/>Some of the experts who flew out looked over and said in astonishment!<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze across them and slightly adjusted his brows!<br/><br/>“Why are there so many phoenixes? What are the powerhouses of the Phoenix tribe doing? They are using so many powerhouses. What is this?”<br/><br/>He mumbled and continued to sit there casually, waiting for them to come closer!<br/><br/>“HMM? This dragon king is really confident!”<br/><br/>Gardecker Angel, the Fire Vanishing Heaven Phoenix and the rest of the powerhouses flew over. It was completely different from what they had expected the Dragon King to escape directly!<br/><br/>The Dragon King was still sitting there calmly. He did not seem to care about them at all!<br/><br/>“Hehe, this is even better!”<br/><br/>Gardecker angel sneered. They exchanged a glance and flew directly toward the trading site!<br/><br/>They surrounded Wang Xian in a formation.<br/><br/>“The Dragon King is really strong-willed!”<br/><br/>The Fiery Eagle Phoenix flew to the front and flapped its wings. It stared at Wang Xian and said calmly!<br/><br/>“If someone is here to give me resources, I will naturally welcome them!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s gaze landed on the Fire Eagle Phoenix as he said with a smile!<br/><br/>This was an existence on the level of a madman!<br/><br/>“Haha, Dragon King, we will take all of your fruits!”<br/><br/>The Fire Eagle Phoenix laughed out loud and said to Wang Xian calmly.<br/><br/>“If you want them, give me the resources in exchange.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said calmly!<br/><br/>“I still prefer the Dragon King to give me the longevity fruit!”<br/><br/>The Fire Eagle said with a smile!<br/><br/>“I don’t give the longevity fruit to beggars!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head slowly and said mockingly!<br/><br/>Give it to you?<br/><br/>Hehe, this is really interesting!<br/><br/>“You’re looking for trouble!”<br/><br/>“You’re here to target the Dragon King on purpose. Are you here to give me the longevity fruit?”<br/><br/>“I think so. The Phoenix clan doesn’t seem to have any conflict with the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>“Look over there, there are experts from the Angel clan. The Angel Clan has a grudge with the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>The old monsters around them looked at this scene in astonishment!<br/><br/>The experts from the Phoenix clan were here to take the eternal fruit?<br/><br/>The amount of power they had used was a little too much. were they going to threaten the Dragon King?\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
