I don’t understand why the Holy Dragon tribe is so insistent on fighting the ancestral dragon lineage. Is there something else involved?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head. He felt a little helpless in his heart.<br/><br/>Although his current strength was not bad, there were still some things that he could not come into contact with.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, what should we do now?”<br/><br/>Tian Chen frowned and asked Wang Xian.<br/><br/>If it was a war between the ancestral dragon lineage and the Holy Dragon lineage, the Holy Dragon experts would want to kill those with the Divine Dragon bloodline other than them.<br/><br/>The members of the Dragon Palace could also fish in troubled waters and kill the experts of the Holy Dragon lineage.<br/><br/>But now, not only the ancestral dragon bloodline, but also many bounty hunters. They wanted to obtain the mission rewards and kill those with the Divine Dragon Bloodline.<br/><br/>The members of the Dragon Palace didn’t know who the bounty hunters were, let alone that every creature could be a bounty hunter.<br/><br/>This was a bit difficult to do!<br/><br/>In the end, the mission of the Hundred Cities Alliance had a great impact.<br/><br/>“Tell the members of the Dragon Palace to be careful first. Also, inform the eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest to bring their subordinates to infiltrate Tian Heng City, Great Marquis City, Light Dragon City, and Sun City. Wait for the Order.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian ordered, “Also, keep an eye on the surroundings.”<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The Heaven Array nodded.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked outside and shook his head slightly.<br/><br/>He was prepared to cultivate for a period of time to search for treasures in the river of eternity. Now, it seemed that his plan had failed.<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. On the third day, the Azure Dragon Moon came to pay a visit. Then, he led a group of disciples from the ancestral dragon lineage and left Lotus Peak.<br/><br/>They wanted to meet up with some other powerhouses.<br/><br/>According to him, they did not launch a counterattack for the time being. This was because the leader of the ancestral dragon lineage and some powerhouses from the ancestral dragon lineage could not be contacted for the time being.<br/><br/>They did not dare to launch a counterattack rashly.<br/><br/>Furthermore, they could not find any evidence for the siege of the four great cities.<br/><br/>Now, they gathered together and waited for orders.<br/><br/>The ancestral dragon tribe was a little passive. The entire ancestral dragon tribe had been scattered and could not form a powerful force.<br/><br/>Green Dragon Moon bade farewell to Wang Xian. In the following period of time, an lie continued to search for the water lotus. The river of eternity had also calmed down.<br/><br/>The situation in the outside world became more and more intense. The cultivators of the divine dragon lineage suffered from a terrifying attack.<br/><br/>As time passed, the harvest of an lie in the river of eternity became less and less.<br/><br/>It was not even enough to form a ninth-grade water lotus.<br/><br/>As time passed, the battle between the Divine Dragon lineage and the ancestral dragon lineage became more and more intense.<br/><br/>There were even rumors that there were experts from the ancestral dragon lineage who charged into the nest of the divine dragon lineage and an earth-shattering battle broke out.<br/><br/>The outcome of the battle was unknown, but they must have paid a hefty price.<br/><br/>Ba Qi and Mo Sha led 10,000 poisonous horned dragons over.<br/><br/>The birth of poisonous horned dragons was very special. Similar to Dragon Wizards, the number of poisonous horned dragons could only reach 10,000.<br/><br/>However, 10,000 was not a small number. Wang Xian had already sent them into the four major cities.<br/><br/>The four major cities were relatively quiet now. The others did not know that they were secretly hunting experts from the Holy Dragon lineage.<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>After five years of calm, an Lie’s figure appeared in front of Wang Xian on this day.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, something huge seems to have happened in the middle of the river of eternity. When I was around just now, I felt a surge of majestic water energy and life force being transmitted over.”<br/><br/>An lie said with a face full of astonishment.<br/><br/>“Huh? What’s going on?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was slightly taken aback as he looked at an lie.<br/><br/>An lie shook his head.<br/><br/>“Let’s go and take a look!”<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>The next moment, under the cover of an lie, Wang Xian appeared at the bottom of the river where the water in the Sky had fallen.<br/><br/>The moment he appeared, he felt a surge of majestic energy surging over.<br/><br/>This energy was accompanied by an intense life force and water energy.<br/><br/>“This is? This energy is so familiar!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly as he looked ahead in shock.<br/><br/>He couldn’t see any living beings at a glance. However, that powerful energy was coming from the center.<br/><br/>This energy was similar to the energy emitted by the water lotus.<br/><br/>However, it was dozens of times more powerful than the ninth-grade water lotus in his hand.<br/><br/>“The energy of the water lotus is pretty good. Could it be that a twelfth-grade water lotus has appeared inside?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he speculated in his heart.<br/><br/>However, he didn’t dare to enter.<br/><br/>This made him frown slightly.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian sensed a tremor in the area in front of him. A beam of light was surging towards him.<br/><br/>He was slightly shocked. His body moved and he immediately flew upwards.<br/><br/>When he flew out of the water surface, he saw a huge shadow. It was located in the huge water in the sky.<br/><br/>It was a lotus flower. The lotus flower was emitting a blue luster.<br/><br/>The petals were blooming one after another. It was extremely lifelike.<br/><br/>There was a total of 12 petals!<br/><br/>The entire lotus flower shadow blotted out the sky and the Sun. The water in the sky fell as though it was watering this beautiful lotus flower.<br/><br/>“A twelfth-grade water lotus is a twelfth-grade water lotus. To be able to create such power, it must be a twelfth-grade water lotus.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian widened his eyes and revealed a shocked expression.<br/><br/>A twelfth-grade water lotus was a treasure that was even more powerful than an innate treasure.<br/><br/>This phenomenon was definitely related to a twelfth-grade water lotus.<br/><br/>The water on the surface of the river rippled. If one looked down from a high altitude, one would notice that these ripples formed a gigantic water lotus that was rippling towards the surroundings.<br/><br/>The speed of the water ripples was the same, and it was abnormally mystical.<br/><br/>Wang Xian took out the ancient blueprint and was slightly surprised when he saw the situation on it.<br/><br/>The ancient blueprint emitted a strong luster. There was a huge lotus flower that was born in the middle of the blueprint.<br/><br/>It formed the image of a twelfth-grade water lotus flower.<br/><br/>“A twelfth-grade water lotus flower has been born. The cosmic behemoth that is the ruler of the universe might have been waiting for its birth.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>He wanted to obtain such a treasure, but the possibility of obtaining it was zero.<br/><br/>Such a treasure was guarded by a cosmic dominator-level space beast!<br/><br/>Even if an lie went over, he would be killed instantly. There was no time for him to escape.<br/><br/>“This commotion is too big. I guess the entire river of Eternity will know soon. They won’t know how long it will take for this twelfth-grade water lotus flower to be born. If it takes too long, I guess there will be countless experts coming over.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled as he looked ahead quietly.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
