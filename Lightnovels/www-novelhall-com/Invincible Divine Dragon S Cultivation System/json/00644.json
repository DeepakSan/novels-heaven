Whoosh! Whoosh!”<br/><br/>“Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!”<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>As the Dragon Palace’s auction approached, more and more experts arrived around the heavenly river!<br/><br/>Some experts rushed over at a terrifying and strange speed!<br/><br/>Some experts were majestic and gave off boundless might as they directly crossed over!<br/><br/>There were also some high-level races that directly rode enormous flying vehicles!<br/><br/>However, when the great disciples of these high-level races arrived, they were all very low-key. They floated in the sky above the Milky Way and looked around with curiosity!<br/><br/>“Many powerful high-level races have come. They are the star soul race. This race has many universe masters with level-three combat power. Once, their race obtained a powerful meteorite, which caused over a hundred great beings of their race to undergo a mutation. It is said that there are no less than 30 universe masters with level-three Combat Power!”<br/><br/>“That’s cold light sword god from the cold light 19 provinces. I didn’t expect him to be here as well. He is a powerful existence with an innate supreme treasure. He is definitely an extremely terrifying existence below the peak races of our inner continent. I heard that he has taken in a disciple.”<br/><br/>“Look over there quickly. That should be the experts from the invincible region, right? The baleful aura from their bodies is so strong.”<br/><br/>“There are two great beings from the star soul race who came from the invincible region. They are all terrifyingly powerful. Now that so many great beings from the invincible region are here, I’m afraid that the Great Beings from the pinnacle races will come as well, right?”<br/><br/>The discussions in the surroundings continued.<br/><br/>The first to arrive was a group of high-level races. However, all the great beings and disciples knew that there would be great beings from the pinnacle races coming as well!<br/><br/>An innate supreme treasure was enough to attract the strong warriors from the peak races. It was enough to attract the masters of the universe!<br/><br/>After all, an innate supreme treasure was extremely precious to the Masters of the universe!<br/><br/>“There are many strong warriors coming this time. Tell the strong warriors of the Dragon Palace to pay attention and activate the formation!”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian, who was in the Dragon Palace, glanced around and ordered Prime Minister Gui!<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui nodded his head!<br/><br/>The auction of the Dragon Palace was getting closer and closer, and there were more and more experts. At the very least, the Dragon Palace had to be on guard!<br/><br/>The experts from the peak races would not break the rules, but there would be other experts as well, especially those old freaks from the Invincible Zone!<br/><br/>There was no room for failure in this auction!<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>Soon, a terrifying energy soared into the sky from the auction ground beside the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>Dragon pillars appeared out of thin air around them, and on top of the dragon pillars, there were divine dragons spiraling around. They stood there lifelike!<br/><br/>A pair of ice-cold dragon eyes scanned the surroundings!<br/><br/>“Crack! Crack! Crack!”<br/><br/>At the same time, huge devil dragon cannons were aimed at the surroundings of the auction from the West Gate!<br/><br/>Each of the 18 demonic dragon cannons contained a terrifying power!<br/><br/>Just one look at them would make one’s heart palpitate!<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>“Hiss, what’s This?”<br/><br/>When the array formation of the Dragon Palace and the demonic dragon cannons were raised, all the experts and disciples of the forces that had arrived looked over in shock!<br/><br/>When they sensed the great terror on the Dragon Pillars!<br/><br/>When they saw the dark and deep magic dragon cannon that made people’s hearts palpitate, their bodies couldn’t help but tense up!<br/><br/>“Hiss, what array formation is this? Why does it give people such a terrifying feeling? This array formation should be able to easily kill me!”<br/><br/>At a place in the Heavenly River, the pupils of a group of old monsters who had rushed over from the invincible region slightly shrank when they saw the array formation that had suddenly risen up!<br/><br/>An old monster widened his eyes and couldn’t help but growl in a low voice!<br/><br/>The formation that rose up from the auction beside the Dragon Palace could instantly kill him!<br/><br/>“As expected of an existence that can kill the old scholar, the supreme water demon king, and the Black Tower Magus. Just this formation alone can contend against universe overlords!”<br/><br/>An Old Magus from the invincible region glanced at the formation and commented!<br/><br/>“This dragon palace is indeed not simple. With eighteen terrifying war weapons, five or six universe overlords with stage three battle strength can easily be killed!”<br/><br/>“The former Dragon God clan. It seems that this dragon king must have obtained a powerful dragon God inheritance. They might be able to become a pinnacle race again!”<br/><br/>Some of the old monsters from the Invincible region were discussing!<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, the experts from the other high-level races could faintly hear the discussion. Their faces were also filled with shock!<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace is truly invincible. They haven’t even sent out any experts yet. Just their array formations and war weapons alone can easily destroy us. No race below the pinnacle is invincible!”<br/><br/>On the side of the star soul race, an old monster who had just returned from the invincible region couldn’t help but speak out!<br/><br/>The surrounding experts of the star soul race silently nodded their heads!<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace could easily annihilate them!<br/><br/>Even existences at the level of the star soul race were so shocked, not to mention the other races!<br/><br/>All of them looked on with faces full of shock!<br/><br/>“HM? A great being from a pinnacle race is here!”<br/><br/>As the auction drew closer and closer, the great disciples from the pinnacle races appeared!<br/><br/>The first to appear was the great being from the ELF race.<br/><br/>The great disciples from the Elf race arrived, and the leader of the team was life sonic arrow. Other than him, a great being at the universe ruler realm, the rest were all existences below the universe ruler ruler realm!<br/><br/>The ELF race mainly focused on the wood attribute. The innate true treasures auctioned this time were not of much use to the ELF race.<br/><br/>Therefore, only one powerful warrior had come to lead the team, but more than a thousand disciples of the Elf race had come!<br/><br/>“Welcome, Lord Life Sonic Arrow!”<br/><br/>The Elf race had a benefactor, Wang Xian, who personally came to welcome him. He cupped his hands at life Sonic Arrow!<br/><br/>“Hehe, you don’t have to be so polite, Dragon King. With your current strength, I’m afraid you aren’t weaker than me. You might surpass me soon!”<br/><br/>The sound of life arrow smiled at Wang Xian and said!<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The Elf disciples around the sound of life arrow cupped their hands at Wang Xian and greeted him!<br/><br/>Firstly, Wang Xian’s strength was terrifying enough.<br/><br/>Of course, the main reason was because of the accompanying elves!<br/><br/>The status of the accompanying elves in the Elf clan was very high. Ordinary disciples would have to address them as ‘Sir’when they met!<br/><br/>As the owner of the accompanying elves, Wang Xian, they would naturally treat him with respect!<br/><br/>“Hehe, everyone, please come in!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and led them into the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>With the arrival of the ELF race, more and more experts from the other peak races came one after another!<br/><br/>The Divine Tiger Race, the demon race, the nether race, and the experts from the Celestial Nation!<br/><br/>The Divine Tiger Race had all kinds of attributes. As for the demons and the nether race, they mainly cultivated the darkness attribute!<br/><br/>The disciples of the experts from the Celestial Nation also had all kinds of attributes.<br/><br/>The experts and disciples from the four peak races flew over without hiding anything. Wang Xian brought Prime Minister Gui to welcome them personally!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
