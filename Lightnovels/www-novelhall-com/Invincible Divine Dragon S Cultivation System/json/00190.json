Suddenly, he sensed the movement coming from the ground in front of him. His brows were tightly knitted, and his eyes were cold and alert.<br/><br/>When he first entered this place, he didn’t sense the aura of any living creature.<br/><br/>Who was that in the soil?<br/><br/>His dragon eyes were flickering.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>At this moment, the Heaven Dragon King who was in the soil stood up slowly. The soil on his body fell off and his true appearance was revealed.<br/><br/>“Eh? It’s You, Heaven Dragon King?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian recognized him and a solemn expression appeared on his face. He stared at him intently and asked, “You inherited this Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>“Not yet, but I will soon inherit this Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>The Heaven Dragon King Sized Up Wang Xian with a fiery gaze. His face was filled with a ferocious smile.<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>Upon hearing his reply, a hint of doubt flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes.<br/><br/>“What a strong bloodline, what a pure bloodline of the Divine Dragon. Hahaha, if I can obtain your bloodline, I will definitely be able to make the divine dragon race stand at the peak once again!”<br/><br/>“However, this is about to happen. Soon, I, the Heaven Dragon King, will become the strongest divine dragon in the universe.”<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>The Heaven Dragon King roared ferociously and excitedly. His body had undergone a transformation.<br/><br/>He had a huge horn, huge wings, and a dragon tail that was similar to the Divine Dragon.<br/><br/>This was the appearance of his true form.<br/><br/>Sensing the aura of the Heaven Dragon King and listening to his words, Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression.<br/><br/>“You want to obtain my bloodline?”<br/><br/>As he spoke, he stared at the black liquid in his palm. The energy that was extinguished trembled slightly.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>However, when the energy swept past, the black liquid did not dissipate. Instead, it transformed into a special symbol.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, today, your bloodline is my bloodline. I have spent a lot of effort and schemed for three years just to wait for this moment. Don’t worry, Dragon King. I will bring the bloodline in your body to greater heights!”<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar! The power that comes from the taboo comes from the most ancient technique, the heaven pilfering technique. Activate!”<br/><br/>He raised his head and let out an excited roar.<br/><br/>Following that, black symbols gushed out from his body and spread toward Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the strange symbols. With a wave of his arm, the five elements millstone appeared in his hand.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>With a wave of his arm, a frost divine sword slashed directly at the strange symbol that was connected together.<br/><br/>Bang<br/><br/>However, what surprised Wang Xian was that when the frost divine sword landed on the strange symbol, it did not have the slightest fluctuation.<br/><br/>It did not stop it at all.<br/><br/>This caused his expression to change slightly.<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>At this moment, the strange symbol in front of him instantly entered his body.<br/><br/>This caused his expression to change drastically. The bad premonition in his heart became even stronger.<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>When the strange symbol entered his body, the strange symbol that flew out from the Heavenly Dragon King’s body flew over quickly.<br/><br/>The five elements grinding was used to block it, but it was useless.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>The strange symbol entered Wang Xian’s body. This made him feel extremely cold.<br/><br/>This strange symbol connected him to the Heaven Dragon King.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, this is indeed a forbidden technique. It is indeed an ancient technique!”<br/><br/>“Heaven pilfering pulse changing technique!”<br/><br/>The Heaven Dragon King saw the strange black symbol entering Wang Xian’s body. Through this strange symbol, he could feel the surging bloodline power in his body.<br/><br/>This made his body tremble. The greed and excitement in his heart reached its peak.<br/><br/>“Heaven Pilfering Meridian Exchange?”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard these words again, the intense uneasiness in his heart became even stronger.<br/><br/>The Heaven Dragon King in front of him looked even more ferocious and excited.<br/><br/>His body trembled, but he realized that the energy in his body could not be mobilized.<br/><br/>This caused his expression to change slightly.<br/><br/>“Let’s begin, Meridian Exchange!”<br/><br/>“I will possess your bloodline. I will exterminate your Dragon Palace, carry forward the Heaven Dragon Clan, and lead our Heaven Dragon Clan to Glory!”<br/><br/>The Heaven Dragon King raised his head and roared in excitement.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, not bad, not bad, not bad at all.”<br/><br/>All of a sudden, a voice rang out, startling Wang Xian and the Heaven Dragon King.<br/><br/>In the next moment, the Heaven Dragon King’s figure disappeared. An illusory figure formed from black symbols appeared in front of them.<br/><br/>The head was like a camel, the horns were like a deer, the eyes were like a rabbit, the ears were like an ox, the neck was like a snake, the abdomen was like a clam, the scales were like a carp, the claws were like an eagle, and the palms were like a tiger.<br/><br/>Looking at the illusory figure in front of him and the black symbol, Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly.<br/><br/>This was a divine dragon, a real divine dragon.<br/><br/>However, it seemed to have lost its physical body and only had that illusory energy.<br/><br/>“I have waited for billions of years. Finally, I have waited for a divine dragon with such a high bloodline. Furthermore, it is a mutated divine dragon that is far superior to a purebred divine dragon. I have not waited for billions of years in vain!”<br/><br/>The Divine Dragon Phantom roared with excitement.<br/><br/>“You…”<br/><br/>“You’re the Tianhai Dragon King?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at him. His pupils contracted slightly as he spoke with a vigilant expression.<br/><br/>“Haha, that’s right. It’s me, the Dragon King. I’ve been here for billions of years. After billions of years of elimination and loneliness, I could have possessed them long ago. However, their bloodline is too garbage.”<br/><br/>“I’ve been waiting, waiting for a powerful person with the Divine Dragon bloodline to enter. Today, I’ve finally waited, I’ve finally waited.”<br/><br/>“The emperor and the heavens have not let down their painstaking efforts. Hahaha, I’m very satisfied with your bloodline.”<br/><br/>“Heaven pilfered to change my bloodline, using your bloodline to condense my body!”<br/><br/>The Tianhai Dragon King roared ferociously as well.<br/><br/>He had endured too much during these billions of years.<br/><br/>However, this day had finally arrived. The bait that he had released, the Tianhai Dragon King, did not let him down.<br/><br/>He had even given him such a great gift.<br/><br/>As long as he could condense his body with his bloodline, he would be able to completely recover and get rid of his current appearance.<br/><br/>He would be able to see the sun again.<br/><br/>He would be able to step into glory.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed the energy on the strange dark symbols. His expression changed drastically as he raised his head and let out a dragon roar.<br/><br/>He transformed into the body of a divine dragon and the mighty energy swept forward.<br/><br/>“It’s useless. This is a forbidden power. This is an ancient spell. You Can’t break free from it.”<br/><br/>The Tianhai Dragon King laughed out loud as he spoke. When he saw Wang Xian’s body of a divine dragon, a dark glow shot out from his eyes.<br/><br/>“What a powerful bloodline of a divine dragon. It actually possesses so many attributes. Very good, very good. It belongs to Me Now!”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
