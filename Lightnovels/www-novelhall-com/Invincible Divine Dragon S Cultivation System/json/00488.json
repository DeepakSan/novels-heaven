One had to rely on their own perception.<br/><br/>Spreading one’s own energy around the surroundings, sensing the surroundings.<br/><br/>Similarly, once one’s energy sensed the surroundings, it was like a bright lamp in the dark night. It was also easily discovered by other powerhouses or living beings.<br/><br/>This place was more suitable for the powerhouses of the skeleton race, because their bodies were also the best cover.<br/><br/>Other creatures were not as suitable as the skeletons.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the skeletons, demon skeletons, and any other powerhouses were the same. They could only use their energy to sense their surroundings.<br/><br/>It was also a bright light in the dark night.<br/><br/>When two waves of energy collided, they could determine the opponent’s position and consider whether to attack.<br/><br/>However, there were also some skeletons and demon skeletons who hid their bodies and quietly lay there waiting for people to arrive before hunting.<br/><br/>Therefore, this was also the place where the abyss skeleton pool was more dangerous than the underground demon cave city.<br/><br/>Wang Xian entered the pool but did not sense his surroundings. Instead, he made his netherspirit avatar appear.<br/><br/>The Netherspirit avatar did not have a physical body, so its sensing ability was relatively strong. The Netherspirit Avatar flew in front while he followed behind.<br/><br/>It was still the same as the underground demon cave city.<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>He kept flying downwards. Due to the existence of the withered bones, Wang Xian’s speed was less than 1/100,000 of his usual speed.<br/><br/>In other words, his current speed was equivalent to that of a level five or six universe knight.<br/><br/>After all, there was the barrier of the withered bones.<br/><br/>However, the Ghost Avatar’s speed was not affected at all here.<br/><br/>“Eh!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian dived downwards for five to six hours, the ghost avatar immediately sensed something.<br/><br/>“Whoosh!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian controlled the ghost avatar. His body moved and instantly flew in a certain direction.<br/><br/>“Crash!”<br/><br/>When the ghost avatar approached, a skull instantly released a skeleton flame and fled into the distance.<br/><br/>However, his speed was greatly affected in this place. The ghost avatar easily caught up to him and held him in his hand.<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew over, grabbed the skull, and looked it up and down.<br/><br/>“A skull gave birth to spiritual intelligence and has the combat strength of a level seven universe knight. TSK TSK, this land of demonic bones is really magical.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the skull. A skull in this form could completely destroy his spiritual intelligence and turn it into a powerful weapon.<br/><br/>However, he wasn’t interested in this level. He was directly absorbed by the Taiji Dragon Disc.<br/><br/>Continue!<br/><br/>He realized that the Netherworld ghost was like a fish in water as long as he could sense it. The other party wouldn’t be able to escape.<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued to fly deeper into the abyss.<br/><br/>He continued to fly deeper into the abyss. According to the information he obtained from the spiritual demon race, this abyss was tens of millions of kilometers deep.<br/><br/>When he reached the bottom, he could explore his surroundings.<br/><br/>Due to the decrease in speed, these tens of millions of kilometers could not be compared to the outside world.<br/><br/>Wang Xian explored bit by bit. Three days later, the ghost avatar sensed something again and charged over directly.<br/><br/>This time, he obtained a bone. It was a dead bone of a living creature. Now, it had the combat strength of a peak universe knight.<br/><br/>After all, Wang Xian’s strength was already very strong. He explored little by little and gradually gained more and more.<br/><br/>A special demonic skeleton formed by a head and a bone possessed the combat strength of a Level 1 universe dominator.<br/><br/>A demonic skeleton formed by four bones that were randomly pieced together possessed the combat strength of a peak-level universe knight.<br/><br/>There were all kinds of strange demonic skeletons. During the journey, Wang Xian even met a few experts.<br/><br/>They sensed for a while but did not make a move. They separated immediately.<br/><br/>Since the other party did not provoke Wang Xian, Wang Xian would not kill for no reason.<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. Half a year passed in the blink of an eye. During this half a year, Wang Xian was very satisfied with his gains.<br/><br/>He obtained four demon skeletons with the combat strength of A Level One universe dominator.<br/><br/>This gain was definitely very powerful.<br/><br/>“I wonder if the Hundred Cities Alliance and the Holy Dragon lineage have sent experts to kill me.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled to himself and smiled. He continued to search ahead.<br/><br/>The information regarding the abyssal skeleton pool in the information regarding the spiritual demon race was relatively smaller.<br/><br/>After all, there was no sense of direction here. There was only a rough area. Could there be powerful demon skeletons here.<br/><br/>The Tai Chi Dragon Disc had already recovered and was floating around the Netherworld Ghost. This gave the Netherworld Ghost Avatar a great boost.<br/><br/>It continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>However, half a month later, the Netherworld Ghost Avatar was advancing and sensing the surroundings.<br/><br/>All of a sudden, a terrifying attack attacked him.<br/><br/>The attack came from a spot ten meters away from him.<br/><br/>The sudden attack caused Wang Xian’s expression to change drastically.<br/><br/>A Ray of blood-red light pierced straight through the head of the Netherworld Ghost Avatar.<br/><br/>The Tai Chi Dragon disc automatically revolved.<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>However, what shocked Wang Xian was that the tai chi dragon disc was slowly collapsing under the attack of the blood-red light.<br/><br/>This caused his expression to change drastically.<br/><br/>An attack that could break through the Tai Chi Dragon Disc’s defense was able to threaten Wang Xian’s life.<br/><br/>Just like the previous attack by the Divine Light Dragon, although cracks appeared on the Taiji Dragon Plate, a backlash was surging toward it.<br/><br/>Wang Xian could clearly feel the blood-red light trembling.<br/><br/>“A finger? A Pink Finger?”<br/><br/>When he saw the demonic skeleton in the blood-red light, his gaze froze.<br/><br/>The pink finger bone reminded Wang Xian of a pink skeleton palm he had obtained from the level-two battle-strength skeleton, the Master of the universe.<br/><br/>It possessed the attributes of darkness and fire.<br/><br/>However, it was different from this finger bone. This finger bone gave birth to intelligence and belonged to the demonic skeleton.<br/><br/>“It has not reached the level three battle-power of the universe dominator. I can deal with it.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian focused his gaze and flapped the uninitiated holy wings on his back vigorously.<br/><br/>Crack! Crack! Crack<br/><br/>The surrounding dry bones surged in all directions. He attacked the pink finger at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>With a wave of his palm, the five elements grinding mill broke through the dry bones one by one and attacked the pink finger as well.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>When the pink finger saw that its attack did not kill the ghost avatar, it sensed Wang Xian’s attack and emitted a strong glow.<br/><br/>It did not escape but continued to pierce through the Ghost Avatar.<br/><br/>The ghost avatar quickly gathered energy to defend itself.<br/><br/>“Ah!”<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian could feel the immense pain coming from the Netherworld Ghost Avatar very quickly.<br/><br/>The attack of this pink finger bone was accompanied by elemental attacks. Its attack power was comparable to two to three powerhouses of the same level.<br/><br/>The Netherworld Ghost Avatar was completely no match for him!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
