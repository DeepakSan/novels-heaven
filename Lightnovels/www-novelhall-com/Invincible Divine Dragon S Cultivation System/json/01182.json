If he could kill them, he would kill them.<br/><br/>It was similar to how heaven’s gift didn’t have any enmity with them. However, they all wanted to kill Heaven’s gift and obtain the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation.<br/><br/>It didn’t matter if it was good or bad. There was only the cruel law of the universe!<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued his pursuit. However, what made him a little regretful was that the energy of the wind and thunder lock on the enemy disappeared after more than ten minutes.<br/><br/>The ability of the Netherworld Dragon to pursue and attack required a very long time before it could be used once.<br/><br/>Without this ability, it was too difficult for Wang Xian to chase down a heaven’s origin creator!<br/><br/>Just like how the powerhouses in the Void Universe chased after Wang Xian back then, it was exceptionally difficult to kill a heaven’s origin creator!<br/><br/>After more than ten hours, Wang Xian gave up completely and summoned the five elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate over!<br/><br/>After that, he flew towards Earth City.<br/><br/>As he had used the Netherworld Dragon’s pursuit ability once, the place where Wang Xian was currently at was no longer at the Earth Plains. Instead, he was at the grassland!<br/><br/>However, without the suppression of the six universes, Wang Xian’s speed was still very fast!<br/><br/>Halfway through, the twelve ancestral witches, the elven empress, and a few other strong cultivators in the Heaven’s origin realm sent a message to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>They wanted to meet Wang Xian at the tree of chaos beside the nine-origin universe to see if they could make a deal!<br/><br/>After Wang Xian saw their message, he immediately agreed to it!<br/><br/>He had many corpses of Heaven origin creation stage powerhouses in his hands. The twelve ancestral witches knew about it.<br/><br/>Such resources were of great use to heaven origin creation stage powerhouses!<br/><br/>Needless to say, it could be used to nurture his subordinates!<br/><br/>Furthermore, the corpses in Wang Xian’s hands could not be used up. He could definitely trade with them in exchange for some treasures and resources!<br/><br/>“This time, I should be able to gather the resources needed for my breakthrough! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes flickered.<br/><br/>He had gained enough this time.<br/><br/>After chatting with the 12 ancestors, the Elf Queen, and the rest for a while, he returned to Earth City not long after.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian rushed over, he discovered that some of the destroyed buildings in earth city had been rebuilt.<br/><br/>In Earth City, there was the aura of a heaven’s origin creator.<br/><br/>“The Earth Element Heaven’s origin creator has returned. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself. He sensed the location of Tian Ci and immediately flew over!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Soon, Wang Xian’s figure appeared in a hall.<br/><br/>There were six seats above the hall.<br/><br/>Lin Niu had transformed into his human form and sat on the seat above. Beside him, Tian Ci was also sitting there.<br/><br/>The other one was the six paths universe’s Tianyuan Destiny Realm Powerhouse, Tu Sha City.<br/><br/>In the large hall, there were also the Mu Li tribe’s powerhouse disciples, Tian Ci’s mother, and the rest.<br/><br/>In addition, there were a group of powerhouses at the peak of the ninth level of the universe dominator.<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>When the group of powerhouses from the six paths universe saw the arrival of Wang Xian, they hurriedly greeted him.<br/><br/>At present, the relationship between Wang Xian and their six paths universe was very delicate.<br/><br/>If the three of them wanted to protect Mu Litianci and help him break through to the Tianyuan Destiny realm, then the relationship between Wang Xian and them could be considered very good.<br/><br/>Of course, all of this required the official announcement from their side.<br/><br/>However, they could also tell from the current situation.<br/><br/>Mu Litianci was going to become a heaven origin destiny realm powerhouse in the future.<br/><br/>The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was too powerful. Even if the three of them from the six paths universe wanted to snatch the Heaven Origin Destiny Realm Treasure, the chances were very slim!<br/><br/>“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace of the Divine Dragon Clan from the nine-origin universe, it is really fortunate to be able to get to know each other in such a way. I would also like to thank the Dragon King for helping our six paths universe to protect the treasure of our universe! ”<br/><br/>Upon seeing Wang Xian’s arrival, Tu Sha City immediately stood up and cupped his hands in gratitude with sparkling eyes!<br/><br/>“Foster Father! ”<br/><br/>Upon seeing Wang Xian, Tianci immediately ran to his side.<br/><br/>“Everything is a good fortune! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stroked tianci’s head and said to Tu Sha City with a smile!<br/><br/>“Hehe, it is you, Dragon King, who is fated with our six paths universe. No matter what, our six paths universe needs to thank you properly. If not for you, the ultimate treasure of our six paths universe would have been snatched away. In the future, our six paths universe would also have one less powerhouse who can suppress everything. ”<br/><br/>Tusha city spoke to Wang Xian very politely.<br/><br/>There was nothing they could do about it. The strength that Wang Xian displayed now was not weaker than their six paths universe.<br/><br/>Furthermore, they did not have the suppression of the six paths universe at the moment.<br/><br/>If they were to become enemies with Wang Xian, their entire six paths universe would be plunged into misery.<br/><br/>More than half of the living beings would be wiped out!<br/><br/>“Hehe, maybe we are really fated.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and was very polite to him.<br/><br/>“Ha-ha, indeed fate, this time we want to properly thank the Dragon King!” At that moment, a voice came from outside.<br/><br/>Six paths of the universe, the other two souls of heaven and the Golden Leopard entered the hall.<br/><br/>The spirit of the dead laughed and said to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“No thanks necessary.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head when he saw them coming.<br/><br/>“We have to thank you. If not for your help, our six paths universe would have suffered a great loss today. We have also prepared some treasures to gift to you. We hope that we can make friends with you, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The undead looked at Wang Xian and said seriously.<br/><br/>“If you really want to thank me, give heaven some treasures and let him enter the Heaven’s origin creation realm as soon as possible! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and said to them!<br/><br/>“Haha, that’s fine too. The Tianyuan manifestation treasure can be directly nurtured and recognized as its owner. Tianci is extraordinary since he was born. In the future, we will also be the best comrades. Now, we naturally have to take out the treasures and let him reach the Tianyuan manifestation stage as soon as possible! ”<br/><br/>The specter smiled and nodded.<br/><br/>“Next, since all the tribes of the six paths universe are here, we will hold a grand ceremony to celebrate and congratulate the future Tianyuan manifestation masters of our six paths universe. ”<br/><br/>Tusha city suggested!<br/><br/>“Everyone, please make your decision. However, after a period of time, I will bring Tianci to the nine origin universe. After he has reached the Tianyuan universe, I will ask him to come back.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke to them!<br/><br/>His words stunned the spirits of the dead and their eyes flickered.<br/><br/>Mu Liyin ‘er and the rest were not too surprised by his words.<br/><br/>Tianci had already told them some things.<br/><br/>Mu Liyin ‘er and Tianci’s grandparents also agreed to let Tianci return to the nine-origin universe with Wang Xian.<br/><br/>This was because they knew that in this world, other than them, only Tianci’s foster father was genuinely good to tianci.<br/><br/>He would not harm him.<br/><br/>They also had complete trust in Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Even more than their trust in the three lords of the six paths universe!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
