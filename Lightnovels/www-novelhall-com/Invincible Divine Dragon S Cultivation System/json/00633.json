Is there really an invincible enemy in this world? 2<br/><br/>Run!<br/><br/>Run!<br/><br/>The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was a monster and an existence that could not be provoked!<br/><br/>Now, they could not understand why they had encountered such a terrifying enemy?<br/><br/>Could it be that the other party had inherited the halo of the entire Divine Dragon Clan?<br/><br/>“Run, can we escape?”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui wanted to escape when he saw them?<br/><br/>His face was cold!<br/><br/>“Hahaha, the six great races, our Dragon Palace wants to see where you can run to this time!”<br/><br/>Ba Qi Ao and the others laughed crazily, and a terrifying aura burst out from their bodies!<br/><br/>“Can you escape? This time, I’ll let all of You Die Here!”<br/><br/>The experts of the Dragon Palace roared with murderous intent!<br/><br/>“You think you can kill us and leave so easily?”?<br/><br/>“Then you underestimate the Dragon Palace!”!<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>All the members of the Dragon Palace roared angrily!<br/><br/>Waves of energy shot up into the sky!<br/><br/>“Hiss, what… What’s going on? Why are there so many experts of the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>When all the Great Beings of Dragon Palace released their full power, the 71 Great Beings were stunned again!<br/><br/>The power of universe masters with level 3 power was very obvious!<br/><br/>From the Great Beings of Dragon Palace, they could feel more than 100 waves of this terrifying power!<br/><br/>What did this mean?<br/><br/>It meant that Dragon Palace had more than 100 universe masters with level 3 power!<br/><br/>Oh My God!<br/><br/>Do they still need to live?<br/><br/>“How is this possible? Why are there so many experts in the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>“Why? How is this possible? I don’t believe it!”<br/><br/>The experts of the six great races were all stunned!<br/><br/>They were completely stunned!<br/><br/>“Hahaha, that Magus is dead. The array formation of our dragon palace has been restored!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a Dragon Magus roared and shouted excitedly!<br/><br/>Because of the existence of the Black Tower Magi, the spell formation they had set up had lost its effect!<br/><br/>And after the Black Tower Magi died, the spell formation had been restored!<br/><br/>“No, no, no!”<br/><br/>When the Sacred Dragon King and the others heard this, they felt their vision go black.<br/><br/>The Black Tower Magi had once said that the Dragon Palace’s spell formation was their trump card!<br/><br/>After the spell formation exploded, even experts like the grand aquatic demon king had to be careful!<br/><br/>Now that the array formation had been restored?<br/><br/>“Hahaha, we can finally use the equipment of the fire hammer clan to guard the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the leaders of the Fire Hammer Dragon Clan of the Dragon Palace laughed crazily. Terrifying holes appeared out of thin air around the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>Especially the eighteen holes in the center. Each hole gave them a horrifying feeling!<br/><br/>The 18 cannon holes were surrounded by all sorts of complicated engravings, and the aura they gave off was terrifying and strange!<br/><br/>This was Devil Dragon Cannon!<br/><br/>It was the masterpiece of the fire hammer race!<br/><br/>One cannon could threaten a universe master level three great being, and it was suitable for a defensive battle!<br/><br/>“Not good, not good. We have to break the restriction as soon as possible. We have to escape immediately, or we will be finished!”<br/><br/>An expert from the light giant race said in Panic!<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>“Ah! AWOOOOO!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a sudden scream came from the side!<br/><br/>When they heard the scream, their bodies trembled violently and they looked to the side!<br/><br/>They saw the flesh and blood on the arms of the supreme water demon king flying everywhere. They saw his body flying backward!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace continued to attack the Taishui Demon King!<br/><br/>Just like the performance of the Black Tower’s Magi, killing the experts of the invincible region was like slaughtering a dog!<br/><br/>“Crash!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian flapped his primaless sacred wings. When he saw the severely injured Taishui demon king, he flew over and transformed his arm into a dragon claw!<br/><br/>The divine light dragon on the Taiji Dragon disc attached itself to it and charged heavily at the Taishui Demon King!<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>The Taishui Demon King roared. The flesh on his chest bulged out and formed a flesh and blood defense!<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>The attack landed on his flesh and blood defense. His flesh and blood split apart. However, the Taishui Demon King managed to block this attack!<br/><br/>“I blocked it!”<br/><br/>The taishui demon king was pleasantly surprised. He could block the Dragon King’s attack, even if he would be injured!<br/><br/>However, before he could be proud of himself, Wang Xian launched a series of heavy punches at him!<br/><br/>The bright dragon head kept on attacking and biting at his defense!<br/><br/>The most terrifying part of the Tai Chi Dragon Plate was its defense and Backlash!<br/><br/>As long as the attack power of the Tai Chi Dragon Plate was not broken, it was best not to attack Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Otherwise, all the attacks would backfire on him!<br/><br/>Since he could not break through Wang Xian’s defense, his own defense was the best choice!<br/><br/>However, it was a pity that with the support of the Tai Chi Dragon Plate, Wang Xian’s attack power was at the level of a true ruler of the universe!<br/><br/>Therefore, under Wang Xian’s continuous attacks, the Tai Shui Demon King could not hold on for long!<br/><br/>Especially in such close combat, he would not be able to withstand the attacks even if he had ten lives!<br/><br/>Bam<br/><br/>With a heavy blow, the Dragon Claw entered the body of the Taishui Demon King!<br/><br/>Waves of energy dissipated his life force!<br/><br/>“Hehe, you dare to challenge me with this strength? Silly Dog!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his head and spoke calmly to the Taishui Demon King!<br/><br/>Silly Dog, you’re here to die!<br/><br/>The taishui demon king stared at Wang Xian with its huge eyes and its aura slowly disappeared!<br/><br/>“I’m invincible below the level of the universe’s ruler!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said again indifferently!<br/><br/>The Monster King opened its mouth and its eyes were blood red. “There is no invincible in this world. Explode!”<br/><br/>After saying that, the terrifying energy in its body began to brew!<br/><br/>“Eh? It’s Too Late!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed that the Taiji dragon coiling dark divine dragon had also entered his body!<br/><br/>A corpse quickly fell down!<br/><br/>“Mine, Mine, all mine!”<br/><br/>The king of water tentacles looked at the corpse of the Taishui Demon King and roared with excitement. Then, he flew over quickly!<br/><br/>The corpse was hers!<br/><br/>“It’s over!”<br/><br/>“It’s over!”<br/><br/>From the side, these two words appeared in the minds of the Saint Dragon King and the rest of the experts when they saw the TAISHUI demon king being killed!<br/><br/>It was completely over!<br/><br/>The supreme water demon king was actually killed within a few seconds!<br/><br/>“Oh no!”<br/><br/>When the old scholar saw this scene, his face changed drastically, and his face turned pale!<br/><br/>Weng Weng Weng<br/><br/>At this time, the Dragon Palace’s array formation started to operate, and terrifying dragon pillars appeared in the surroundings!<br/><br/>At the same time, the surrounding sky also changed, and nine-colored energy enveloped it!<br/><br/>Under the Forbidden Sky of the innate supreme treasure, another array formation appeared!<br/><br/>This was the Dragon Palace’s Forbidden Sky Sealing Array Formation!<br/><br/>Another seal appeared in this space!<br/><br/>How could they escape?<br/><br/>“Didn’t the experts of the invincible zone say that they wanted to take the Dragon Palace’s head? Why aren’t they taking it anymore? Are they all trash?”<br/><br/>The Sacred Dragon King couldn’t help but roar when he saw this scene!<br/><br/>Are the experts of the Invincible Zone all trash?<br/><br/>Aren’t they all very confident and arrogant?<br/><br/>Didn’t they say that they wanted to take the Dragon King’s head easily when they came?<br/><br/>What Happened Now?<br/><br/>All of you only know how to F * cking brag, and now you actually put yourselves at risk!<br/><br/>At this moment, they even hated the third Prince of the Angel clan in their hearts!<br/><br/>Why did they look for trash like them?\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
