Sooner or later, we will make them pay a terrible price!”<br/><br/>In the 9-essences universe, when all the disciples heard their arrogant and<br/><br/>provocative words, their faces were extremely ugly!<br/><br/>However, they couldn’t do anything about it!<br/><br/>In fact, they didn’t even have enough confidence to refute!<br/><br/>Prime Minister Turtle and the others who were seated at the side slightly raised their eyebrows when they heard the words of the universe gods!<br/><br/>“Gods who believe in the universe, don’t be too arrogant! ”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Turtle’s eyes flickered slightly. After pondering for a moment, he said indifferently!<br/><br/>“Hahaha, how arrogant are you? What can you do to us if we are arrogant? “If you have the guts, come out and compete with us. Hahaha, do you not dare? But don’t worry, even if you stay in this city, we will kill all of you. Not a single one of you will be spared! ”<br/><br/>Hearing Prime Minister Gui’s words, a tier 7 pantheon had a disdainful look on his face as he spoke coldly!<br/><br/>“Your strength is very strong, but if you want to break through the defense of the Star City, it’s still not enough. In this big battle, it’s hard to say who will win and who will lose!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui replied indifferently!<br/><br/>“Who are you? You are so close to the level of US level 3 gods, yet you still dare to talk to us. Don’t tell me that your 9-origin universe is so trash that you need a level 3 god to speak? hahaha!”<br/><br/>In the belief universe army’s position, a level seven pantheon stared at Prime Minister Gui and said with disdain, his gaze swept across all the elite disciples of the 13 pinnacle races. “In the past, I heard that the 9-origin universe is not weak. Now, it seems that it is not so. After the calamity arrives, you will be the first to be destroyed by our belief universe! ”<br/><br/>“Hehe, indeed, I do not have the qualifications to speak to you, but as long as<br/><br/>My Dragon Palace has the qualifications, that is Enough! ”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui stared at them and replied indifferently.<br/><br/>“Your Dragon Palace is still too weak. Let’s Make a fool of ourselves First! ”<br/><br/>However, as soon as Prime Minister Gui finished his words, an expert of the Phoenix clan who was a ruler of the seventh stage suddenly opened his mouth and said!<br/><br/>“Hehe. ”<br/><br/>Some experts of the Angel clan also sneered and glanced at Prime Minister Gui and the others!<br/><br/>Although the expert from the Phoenix clan didn’t say much and asked for the position in front so that the experts from the belief universe couldn’t hear him, all the disciples from the nine-origin universe could hear him clearly from the position in the back.<br/><br/>Their eyes slightly flickered as they looked at the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>It seemed that it was true…<br/><br/>“Dragon Palace, are you the subordinates of the Dragon Palace, the Dragon<br/><br/>King of the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>“The forces of the Dragon Palace, the Dragon King, will break through your city in a moment. I will make you beg for Death!”<br/><br/>However, just as the eyes of the disciples of the nine-origin universe flashed and they were thinking about something, cold growls came from the front!<br/><br/>“Hehe, yes.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui chuckled when he heard their words.<br/><br/>“HMM? What’s going on?”<br/><br/>(‘I don’t know. What’s going on? Those people who believe in the universe seem to hate the Dragon King a lot. ”<br/><br/>The sudden scene shocked all the powerful disciples in the 9-origin universe!<br/><br/>“Dragon Palace, you are the subordinates of the Dragon King. The Dragon King has been trapped in our belief universe for more than 30 million years. Do you think he can escape and survive?”<br/><br/>“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace must die. All the disciples of Your Dragon Palace must die as well! ”<br/><br/>In one of the 21 legions, a level seven pantheon said with a face full of hatred.<br/><br/>He was a powerhouse of the Heavenly Palace. He had a relative who was killed by Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“Hehe, the power of your belief universe that has gathered half of its power for tens of millions of years has yet to destroy our Dragon King. You will never be able to do so in the future. On the contrary, your belief universe must be destroyed by our Dragon King one by one! ”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui said indifferently!<br/><br/>“Do you think that your Dragon King will be able to escape this time? Our belief universe has used the fragment of the Heavenly Yuan creation treasure. Do you think that your Dragon King can withstand it? Don’t worry, we will destroy you. Next, we will pay a visit to your Dragon King and take his head! ”<br/><br/>Not far away from the Heavenly Palace Army, the powerhouses of the decree palace also said with killing intent!<br/><br/>“Hehe! ”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui smiled coldly. “Who doesn’t know how to Talk Big? The Qianyuan Palace is a good example for you! ”<br/><br/>“Holy Sh * t, Holy Sh * t, What’s going on?”<br/><br/>“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace has been trapped for more than 30 million years?”? “The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace has used half of the power of the universe to resist and even used the fragment of a heavenly Yuan creation-level treasure. This…” “Oh my God, what did the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace Do?”<br/><br/>“No Way, no way. The information that Prime Minister Gui of the Dragon Palace talked to the gods of the belief universe is too terrifying. The belief universe used half of its power to resist the Dragon King. Now, the Dragon King has been trapped for more than 30 million years. Even with the fragment of the heavenly creation, they couldn’t deal with the Dragon King?”<br/><br/>“This? What did the Dragon King Do? What is the lesson from the Qian Yuan Palace?”<br/><br/>At this moment, the powerful disciples of all the races in the nine-origin universe widened their eyes, full of disbelief and shock!<br/><br/>What did they hear?<br/><br/>What did the Dragon King do when all the powerful disciples of the nine-origin universe were unaware?<br/><br/>He was able to make the entire belief universe so angry.<br/><br/>He even gritted his teeth!<br/><br/>What was the lesson of the Qian Yuan Palace?<br/><br/>On the city wall, the experts of the peak races looked at Prime Minister Gui with changing expressions!<br/><br/>“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is indeed very powerful. Without him, the belief universe would have destroyed all the trash in your nine-origin universe tens of millions of years ago. However, it is not too late for us to do so now<br/><br/>“Before the calamity arrives, we will descend on your nine-origin universe and completely destroy your Dragon Palace! ”<br/><br/>At the center of the belief universe army, a Tier 7 pantheon said with a grim expression!<br/><br/>Hearing this, all the powerful disciples of the nine-origin universe were shocked once again.<br/><br/>If not for the Dragon King, we would have been completely destroyed tens of millions of years ago?<br/><br/>This?<br/><br/>The reason why they weren’t destroyed, and why they weren’t driven out of the starry universe, was because of the Dragon Palace Dragon King?<br/><br/>However, when they saw the powerful army and power of the belief universe, the possibility was really high!<br/><br/>At least at that time, their nine-origin universe didn’t have such a powerful starry city!<br/><br/>Then the reason why they were able to fight back and forth with the belief universe for tens of millions of years, was because the Dragon Palace Dragon King restrained half of the power of the belief universe?<br/><br/>So they were able to fight against the belief universe for so long?<br/><br/>At the thought of this, everyone couldn’t help but suck in a breath of cold air, their faces filled with shock.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace was completely different from what they thought!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
