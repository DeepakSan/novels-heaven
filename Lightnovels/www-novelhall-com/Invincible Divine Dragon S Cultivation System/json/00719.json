His eyes were filled with excitement!<br/><br/>The nine-origin Divine Dragon had nine attributes!<br/><br/>The five elements, light and darkness, and wind and thunder were perfectly integrated into his body!<br/><br/>“The number of laws and laws has increased by two at once. I feel that my speed has also increased and my attack power has become stronger. Although I won’t be able to fight against someone of a higher level, it shouldn’t be too much of a problem for me to fight against another person of the same level!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled to himself!<br/><br/>At the thought of this, he suddenly had an idea.<br/><br/>“My current nine attributes are divided into three small groups. Five Elements Fusion, light and Darkness Fusion, wind and thunder fusion. The rest are not fusion. If I can completely fuse the nine attributes together, what would it be like?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian felt that the possibility of this was very high. The entire universe was dominated by nine attributes!<br/><br/>In other words, the energy of the nine attributes were fused together to support this universe!<br/><br/>As for the other frost and fog, they were all evolutions of the nine attributes!<br/><br/>If Wang Xian could completely fuse the nine attributes, then… He could also create a world?<br/><br/>“I don’t think so. The universe also involves space and time.”<br/><br/>He shook his head and mumbled.<br/><br/>“No matter what, my gains this time are too great!”<br/><br/>A satisfied smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face!<br/><br/>After a trip to the invincible zone, his strength had improved. He had also evolved into a nine-origin divine dragon. His current strength, along with the four Netherspirit avatars and his spirit spirit, was extremely heaven-defying.<br/><br/>A master of the universe at the second level was easily killed!<br/><br/>“Prime Minister Gui!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shouted in a low voice.<br/><br/>“I’m Here!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui immediately came to the Dragon King’s Hall and bowed respectfully to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“Tell me about the progress of the members of the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke to Prime Minister Gui!<br/><br/>All the resources that he had obtained in the invincible zone had been placed in the Dragon Palace in advance!<br/><br/>The progress of the members of the Dragon Palace should be over by now!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, currently, the number of powerhouses in the Dragon Palace who have the combat strength of a level three universe overlord has reached 1,500. Meanwhile, the number of members in the Dragon Palace who have the combat strength of a universe overlord or above has reached 4,000!”<br/><br/>“The overall strength has increased by more than seven times compared to before!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister GUI reported respectfully!<br/><br/>This time, Wang Xian had gained a lot. The corpses of the powerhouses from the angel race and the Phoenix race, as well as other things such as the Demon Breaker Circle and the corpses of desolate beasts, had given the Dragon Palace a huge improvement!<br/><br/>Now, among the high-level races in the universe, having a level 3 universe dominator was already an extremely powerful high-level race!<br/><br/>For example, the light giant race and the god Herder race, who were enemies with the Dragon Palace back then, were already very terrifying existences in the universe!<br/><br/>However, their strength was only 20 to 30 level 3 universe Dominators!<br/><br/>The current Dragon Palace had 1,500 level 3 universe masters!<br/><br/>In addition, the Dragon Palace had a frost dragon and two bone dragons!<br/><br/>Apart from that, there were seven mad demons!<br/><br/>The current seven mad demons all had strength that surpassed the mutated Divine Dragon!<br/><br/>Furthermore, they were very close to breaking through!<br/><br/>If Wang Xian allowed them to break through quickly, they might be able to complete the breakthrough within 10 years!<br/><br/>This power was absolutely invincible among the high-level races!<br/><br/>As for the other disciples of the Dragon Palace, they had also received a huge improvement due to Wang Xian’s huge resources!<br/><br/>There were nearly eight million disciples, and none of them were lower than the level of a universe knight!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, with our strength, it won’t be long before we can advance to the peak race!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister GUI said with some excitement!<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. “There’s no rush for now. It would be best if we can get the Dragon Palace to produce dozens of masters in the ruler realm before we announce that we have upgraded to the peak!”<br/><br/>He had always remembered the reminder from the elves!<br/><br/>Furthermore, Wang Xian had completely offended the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan in the invincible zone this time. He had to be careful!<br/><br/>Once the Dragon Palace was elevated to the peak of the race, the other peak races would have sufficient reason to attack the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>“However, although we will not announce that we are the peak race for now, we can still establish the prestige of the Dragon Palace. Pass down the order immediately. From today onwards, all races in the universe are prohibited from hunting the Asian Dragons with the Divine Dragon Bloodline. Any cultivator of the wizard lineage is prohibited from transferring the Asian Dragons’bodies. There are also no forces that have the Divine Dragon bloodline in advance!”<br/><br/>“Those who are not of the Divine Dragon bloodline agree. They are not allowed to be used as mounts. Those who sell the Divine Dragon bloodline are prohibited from doing so!”<br/><br/>“Those who disobey will be exterminated!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian gave an order to prime minister GUI with a dignified expression!<br/><br/>He wanted to re-establish the prestige of the Divine Dragon clan and the prestige of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace had been upgraded step by step. From the outer regions of the universe to the surroundings of the heaven-splitting primordial land, and to the present stage, they had seen many things!<br/><br/>This was especially so when many inferior dragons were reduced to mounts, causing some of the others to become so-called Dragon Knights!<br/><br/>There were even many wizards who transferred the bloodline of the Divine Dragon and hunted inferior dragons!<br/><br/>Wang Xian was going to be completely exterminated for such a matter!<br/><br/>He wanted to let all the forces in the universe know that the lineage of the divine dragon had risen once again, and the might of the Divine Dragon had been re-established!<br/><br/>If there were any forces and powerful disciples who still wanted to be dragon knights, they would just have to wait for the extermination of their entire race!<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui replied immediately. His eyes were sparkling!<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head lightly. “Send the other divine dragons to our other dragon palaces. After the news is released, if this situation doesn’t end within a year, the entire clan will be exterminated!”<br/><br/>“Dragon King, is this the rule of the external world of the heaven-splitting primordial lands? We are now a faction within the heaven-splitting primordial lands. We are forbidden to attack ordinary factions outside the universe!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui hesitated for a moment before replying!<br/><br/>“It’s alright. We will issue an order in advance. The peak races will not interfere because of such a trivial matter!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said indifferently!<br/><br/>Rules were set by the strong to restrain the weak. The current Dragon Palace could already be considered as the peak race of the future!<br/><br/>Under the circumstance of issuing an order in advance, some rules could be completely disregarded!<br/><br/>No one would find trouble with the Dragon Palace over such a trivial matter!<br/><br/>Even if they did, they would at most trigger the experts of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>This was completely unnecessary for the peak races!<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister GUI nodded and left immediately!<br/><br/>Soon, the hundreds of divine dragons in the Dragon Palace arrived at the other dragon palaces through the teleportation array of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace had been upgraded along the way, leaving behind many other dragon palaces in other places!<br/><br/>Some of these dragon palaces were located at the periphery of the heaven-splitting primordial lands, while others were located at the surrounding starry skies.<br/><br/>They flew over naturally to convey Wang Xian’s will!<br/><br/>In the interior of the heaven-splitting primordial lands, a piece of news quickly spread out!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
