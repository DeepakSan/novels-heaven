A hint of fear appeared in their eyes.<br/><br/>This was especially so for the young city Lord and the others. Their eyes were filled with fear.<br/><br/>“What’s going on? What kind of battle pet is this?”<br/><br/>The young city lord of Clay City shouted out involuntarily, his face filled with fear.<br/><br/>“Oh no!”<br/><br/>The expression of the city lord of Clay City also changed drastically.<br/><br/>“Peng!”<br/><br/>In the sky, Lei Ta and the Great Mill of the five elements collided, and Lei ta flew backwards.<br/><br/>There was a crack on the Thunder Tower. It couldn’t withstand a single blow!<br/><br/>“Oh No, Oh No, oh no!”<br/><br/>The expression of the city lord of Clay City changed drastically. His acquired Supreme Treasure had been damaged, and he had also suffered a slight backlash.<br/><br/>“The small Clay City wants to kill me?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at them with a cold gaze. His eyes were filled with killing intent. A complete set of the uninitiated holy wings appeared behind him.<br/><br/>At this moment, he didn’t bother to hide anything and attacked the castellan of Clare city directly.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>Under his terrifying speed, Wang Xian arrived in front of the castellan of Clare City in an instant. His arm transformed into a dragon claw and grabbed at him directly.<br/><br/>When the castellan of Clare City saw Wang Xian’s figure, his pupils constricted slightly. A look of fear appeared in his eyes.<br/><br/>He roared and wanted to hide behind.<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian caught him by surprise. The castellan of Clare City was not prepared and could not dodge Wang Xian’s speed at all.<br/><br/>The Dragon Claw clawed at him. His body was emitting a strong force of lightning and wanted to resist.<br/><br/>“Crack Crack Crack!”<br/><br/>However, the force of lightning collapsed under the Dragon Claw and clawed at his body.<br/><br/>“Dragon Eye Lock!”<br/><br/>The moment Wang Xian grabbed the city lord of Clai City, the dragon eye swept across the surroundings and the trapping formation that enveloped the entire space collapsed.<br/><br/>Numerous chains covered the surrounding area and covered the sky above Clai City.<br/><br/>The millions of strong warriors of Clai City’s army were all covered.<br/><br/>“What… What is going on?”<br/><br/>At this moment, all the strong warriors of Clai City looked at this scene in horror. Their eyes were filled with panic.<br/><br/>“City Lord, City Lord, he…”<br/><br/>“No, no, how could this be? How could that senior brother of the lightning race possess such terrifying strength?”<br/><br/>“This… this…”<br/><br/>At this moment, all of the powerful disciples of Clare City were on the verge of collapse.<br/><br/>Their city Lord was prepared to casually kill their senior brother of the Lightning race, but he did not expect that the other party would be able to unleash such terrifying strength.<br/><br/>With such strength, he was able to capture their castellan in an instant!<br/><br/>Who would dare to believe this?<br/><br/>“With such strength, you still want to kill me? With the strength of your Clay City, you still dare to attack the Thunder Ray race. You are really seeking your own destruction!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared coldly at the castellan of Clay City.<br/><br/>“Cough, cough, cough. How could this be? How could you possess such powerful strength?”<br/><br/>The castellan of Clare City coughed out a large amount of blood. His entire body trembled as he stared at Wang Xian. He roared in disbelief.<br/><br/>“There are many things that you guys can’t Imagine!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said coldly. His gaze landed on the purple lightning snake as he ordered, “Destroy Clare City. Kill everyone!”<br/><br/>“Roar, Roar, Roar!”<br/><br/>The purple lightning snake let out a low roar. The innate spiritual treasure above his head began to emit lightning rays that covered the entire area.<br/><br/>“Crackle!”<br/><br/>In an instant, the terrifying power of lightning attacked the surrounding area.<br/><br/>“Not good, run, run!”<br/><br/>“The surrounding space is sealed, we can’t escape back to our God country in an instant!”<br/><br/>“That Thunder Snake is a pinnacle universe knight, and the Thunder Horn on its head is an innate spirit treasure!”<br/><br/>A terrified roar sounded, and the million strong disciples of the Clay City Army saw the purple thunder snake attacking them, and their faces were filled with fear.<br/><br/>The strength of clay city was not weak. Other than the city Lord who was at the pinnacle of universe knights, there were more than 10 Level 9 universe knights. They could naturally sense the strength of the purple thunder snake and the innate spiritual treasure.<br/><br/>It was also because they could sense it that they felt despair.<br/><br/>What made them even more despair was that the senior brother of the Thunder Race had sealed the surrounding space.<br/><br/>What awaited them next might be death.<br/><br/>“How can a senior brother of the lightning race possess such terrifying strength? This is illogical!”<br/><br/>When the castellan of Clare City heard Wang Xian’s order and saw the purple lightning snake starting to kill, his eyes were blood-red as he roared indignantly.<br/><br/>The other party was only the eldest senior brother of the Lightning race!<br/><br/>Although the status of the eldest senior brother was relatively high, he was still a disciple after all!<br/><br/>Under normal circumstances, eldest senior brother’s strength was completely inferior to that of the elders.<br/><br/>However, the strength displayed by this eldest senior brother of the Lightning race was F * cking stronger than the strongest of the Lightning race!<br/><br/>This was still eldest senior brother?<br/><br/>This was definitely not the Lightning Race’s patriarch?<br/><br/>If they knew that the other party had such terrifying strength, how would they dare to make a move!<br/><br/>“How is this possible!”<br/><br/>At the side, the young castellan of Clare City was also on the verge of collapse. His face was filled with despair.<br/><br/>“Hehe, you guys deserve to die!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian laughed coldly. He exerted force with his dragon claw and a wave of destructive force entered the body of the castellan of Clare City!<br/><br/>“Ah!”<br/><br/>The sound of despair before his death rang out. Wang Xian waved his dragon claw and kept his corpse away. He looked around.<br/><br/>“Don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”<br/><br/>Seeing his father’s death, the young castellan of Clare City roared in horror.<br/><br/>“Ants!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and a wave of energy engulfed them.<br/><br/>“Hiss, hiss, hiss!”<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the purple lightning snake started its massacre in the surrounding area.<br/><br/>The million soldiers of Clare City were completely helpless against the purple lightning snake who possessed an innate spiritual treasure.<br/><br/>Under his rampage and attacks, a million soldiers would not be able to hold on for even a minute.<br/><br/>“Since you dare to deal with the Lightning race, there’s no need for you to exist anymore!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved his body and flew directly to the sky.<br/><br/>The five elements grinding mill expanded rapidly and turned into a terrifying behemoth.<br/><br/>Carrying the deathly silent destructive power of the five elements, it charged downwards.<br/><br/>“Boom Boom Boom!”<br/><br/>Streams of energy swept across, causing all the buildings to rapidly collapse.<br/><br/>“What happened over there?”<br/><br/>“Not good, there are experts invading clay city. The city Lord and the others didn’t seem to be able to resist. Quickly flee!”<br/><br/>“Boom Boom Boom!”<br/><br/>Terrified voices rang out from within clay city. When the residents saw the situation over here, they immediately fled in panic.<br/><br/>“The city Lord has been killed. The city of clay is about to be destroyed!”<br/><br/>Some of the distant experts sensed the situation. Their bodies trembled and they quickly fled.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
