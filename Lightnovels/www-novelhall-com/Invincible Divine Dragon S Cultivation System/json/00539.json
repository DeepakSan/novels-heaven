TSK TSK, if this is given to the spirit red bone, she might really be able to advance to the level of a universe dominator.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the pink skeleton’s parts with a glint in his eyes.<br/><br/>He kept it and prepared to make a trip to the spiritual demon race later.<br/><br/>If the spirit red bone could really advance to the level of a universe dominator, it might be a powerful ally in the future.<br/><br/>Looking around, Wang Xian and the rest found another demon skeleton with the combat strength of a level three universe dominator!<br/><br/>This made Wang Xian look excited.<br/><br/>The demon skeleton with the combat strength of a level three universe dominator, coupled with the twenty or so innate spiritual treasures with darkness attributes, gave the Tai Chi Dragon disc a 100% chance of breaking through!<br/><br/>At that time, unless one possessed an innate supreme treasure, no one below the level of a universe dominator could hurt Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I have obtained a lot of things related to Wizards.”<br/><br/>The sky array found a lot of treasures related to the inheritance of wizards. He looked a little excited.<br/><br/>“Just keep it. There’s also this!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and threw the innate supreme treasure to him!<br/><br/>The source of the curse, the Devil’s corpse!<br/><br/>This was the only innate supreme treasure in the dragon palace at the moment. It was perfect for the sky array.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Wang Xian had a thought in his mind. If he were to fight with someone, as long as he managed to injure the other party and obtain some of the other party’s blood, he would be able to throw it into the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>By then, the Heaven Formation could directly curse and kill the other party!<br/><br/>This was simply too terrifying!<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>When the Heaven Formation saw this innate treasure, his eyes were filled with a fiery look. He sensed it carefully and was slightly excited.<br/><br/>“Thank you, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Tian Chen shouted excitedly.<br/><br/>“Hehe, take it. You are the only one who is suitable to use it in the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and scanned his surroundings. He realized that many of the treasures had been taken away by the king of water touch. “Water touch, you can keep the treasures that can help you recover. However, it is useless. Hand them over.”<br/><br/>“Hehe, good, good!”<br/><br/>Water Touch flew over and replied with a smile.<br/><br/>“Also, go and find the Divine Kingdom of the other master of the universe with a level three combat strength!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian instructed the heaven array.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The Heaven Array replied immediately.<br/><br/>Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and counted his gains. He revealed a satisfied expression.<br/><br/>There were two corpses of the Master of the universe with a level three combat strength. As expected, the Divine Kingdom of the Master of the universe with a level three combat strength could obtain two of them.<br/><br/>Together, they could give birth to three level 3 battle-strength experts of the Universe Dominator in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>There were also ten level 2 battle-strength corpses of the universe dominator. He was still preparing to give birth to level 3 battle-strength experts of the universe dominator.<br/><br/>Together, there were four of them!<br/><br/>Including Wang Xian, the water touch king, and the Heaven Array, there were seven of them!<br/><br/>Wouldn’t it be easy for seven of them to destroy the Hundred Cities Alliance?<br/><br/>The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.<br/><br/>After putting away all the treasures, the heaven array and the water touch king went to deal with the demon Shaman Tribe to search for the divine kingdom and check if there were any treasures in the other castles.<br/><br/>He took out a teleportation item and crushed it. The next moment, his figure appeared in the main hall of the spiritual demon tribe.<br/><br/>“Greetings, Lord Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Upon seeing Wang Xian’s appearance, the guards in the main hall of the spiritual demon race greeted him with exceptional respect.<br/><br/>After a few consecutive visits, he had given ling Honggu a few years worth of pink skeleton body parts as well as a soul-returning fruit. The spiritual demon king had already given the order that when Wang Xian came again, he must be respectful!<br/><br/>“Please inform the Spiritual Demon King!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to the spirit demon race’s powerhouse.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The Spirit Demon Race’s powerhouse nodded and flew out immediately.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, brother Wang Xian is here again. Welcome, Welcome!”<br/><br/>The Spirit Demon King appeared in the main hall quickly. He looked at Wang Xian with flickering eyes.<br/><br/>Ever since he knew that Wang Xian belonged to the Dragon Palace, he had been paying special attention to the war between the Dragon Palace and the Hundred Cities Alliance!<br/><br/>Naturally, he also knew that the Dragon Palace now had a level 3 battle-power Master of the universe.<br/><br/>Now that he saw Wang Xian, he could vaguely sense that this level 3 battle-power master of the universe was the Dragon King!<br/><br/>He was the one in front of him!<br/><br/>This made him slightly shocked. Not long ago, he was a level 2 battle-power master of the universe. Now, he had made a breakthrough?<br/><br/>Moreover, even the leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance was no match for him?<br/><br/>His talent and potential were too strong!<br/><br/>“Spirit Demon King, sorry to disturb you!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian cupped his hands at the spirit demon king. He was also very respectful to him!<br/><br/>After all, he had once dared to protect him under the pressure of the Holy Dragon lineage!<br/><br/>“I really didn’t expect little brother Wang Xian to make another breakthrough in such a short period of time. He is much more powerful than an old fellow like me!”<br/><br/>The Spirit Demon King looked at Wang Xian and said with a smile.<br/><br/>“I’m just lucky!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled humbly. “Oh right, Lord Spirit Demon King, I got some more pink skeleton parts!”<br/><br/>As he spoke, he took out the pink skeleton legs and four finger bones!<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>When he saw Wang Xian taking out five pink skeleton parts, he was stunned!<br/><br/>“This… this… little brother Wang Xian, you got so many again. This?”<br/><br/>He felt that it was unbelievable. He had always given out missions to search for the parts of the pink skeleton in the spiritual demon race.<br/><br/>In the end, after hundreds of millions of years, he only found one pink skeleton!<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian managed to get one in just a few years and one in just a few years. This time, it was even more outrageous. He got a skeleton leg and four finger bones.<br/><br/>This made him feel a little incredulous!<br/><br/>“I was Lucky Too!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled again and said.<br/><br/>Lucky?<br/><br/>Was this luck?<br/><br/>The Spirit Demon King did not ask further. He looked at Wang Xian and sighed. “I will thank you on behalf of my daughter, brother Wang Xian.”<br/><br/>“Brother Wang Xian, follow me!”<br/><br/>The Spirit Demon King hesitated for a moment and said to him.<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head. With a wave of his arm, the spirit demon king brought him to the back of the spirit demon race.<br/><br/>Soon, they arrived in front of an incomparably huge building.<br/><br/>It was formed by an incomparably huge skeleton.<br/><br/>In the land of the demon bones, there was no paradise.<br/><br/>The Spirit Demon King brought him into the beast bones and flew downwards.<br/><br/>Following that, the spirit demon king came to a teleportation formation and dripped a drop of blood into it. The blood merged with the teleportation formation and the teleportation formation lit up.<br/><br/>This kind of teleportation formation could only be opened by a specific bloodline!<br/><br/>The Spirit Demon King took a look at Wang Xian and the two of them stepped into it.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>The next moment, the scene changed. They came to an underground palace. Right in front of them, a bunch of withered bones were burning with flames.<br/><br/>In the sky above the flames, the spirit red bones were sitting cross-legged.<br/><br/>At this moment, her head, her body, and her right leg were all red skeletons!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
