There were symbols on the black branch and it looked very strange.<br/><br/>On the branch of the soul-returning tree, there was a golden fruit.<br/><br/>The golden fruit was in the shape of a dragon and looked like a golden dragon.<br/><br/>Wang Xian walked over and took a look at the black branch. His gaze landed on the fruit and his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>“The golden divine dragon fruit is on the soul-returning embryo. Is it able to revive the Metal Elemental Divine Dragon?”<br/><br/>He mumbled to himself. After hesitating for a moment, he walked over and plucked the fruit.<br/><br/>Sensing the power of the fruit, he moved to the front of the dragon transformation pool.<br/><br/>“The golden divine dragon embryo fruit and the dragon bone of the metal elemental divine dragon should be able to create a golden dragon.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was deep in thought. With a wave of his arm, the dragon bones in the mother nest flew out.<br/><br/>There were more than 100 dragon bones in total. They were all universe knights when they were alive.<br/><br/>Among them, there were more than 10 dragon bones of pure-bred golden dragons.<br/><br/>These dragon bones contained immense pressure.<br/><br/>With a wave of his arm, he threw the more than 10 golden dragon bones into the transforming Dragon Pool.<br/><br/>At the same time, the golden fruit landed around the dozen or so Golden Dragon Bones.<br/><br/>“These dozen or so golden dragon bones can already have the combat strength of more than a dozen universe knights. I hope I can nurture a purebred Golden Dragon.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian muttered.<br/><br/>Purebred divine dragons could fight across three levels. In the Dragon Palace, there were quite a number of dragon species that could fight across three levels.<br/><br/>There was a reason why purebred dragons were the most precious, and that was because of the purity of their bloodlines.<br/><br/>Peak dragon species like Imperial Dragons and thorned dragons were the offspring of purebred dragons and other powerful bloodline creatures.<br/><br/>In other words, because of the purebred dragon bloodline and the mutation, a powerful existence was born.<br/><br/>It was very difficult to replicate the birth of such dragon species.<br/><br/>At the peak of the Divine Dragon Clan, there were no more than 10,000 imperial dragons and berserk dragons.<br/><br/>At that time, over a thousand berserk dragons could form a terrifying army of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>If it wasn’t for the Bug clan’s technology, the Dragon Palace wouldn’t have been able to give birth to a peak dragon so easily.<br/><br/>A purebred divine dragon was very important to the dragon palace because if they wanted to mutate another peak dragon, they needed the bloodline of a purebred divine dragon.<br/><br/>Currently, the Dragon Palace only had two purebred divine dragons, the Thunder Dragon and the Divine Wind Dragon.<br/><br/>If a golden dragon could be born, it would be of great benefit to the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“I hope I can give you a surprise.”<br/><br/>After taking a look in front of the dragon transformation pool, Wang Xian moved his body and arrived in front of the dragon throne.<br/><br/>Behind the Dragon Throne, the ancestral tree was emitting a faint glow. It made Wang Xian feel as if he was in a mystical realm.<br/><br/>He thought of a figure.<br/><br/>With a wave of his arm, a female snake landed in the middle of the Dragon King’s Hall.<br/><br/>“Ah!”<br/><br/>The female snake appeared and looked around in astonishment. When she saw Wang Xian in front of her, a look of awe appeared on her face.<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>She bowed and greeted him immediately.<br/><br/>“HMM, what treasures did you obtain in the Dragon King’s Hall of the skysea Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the female snake and asked.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I have obtained many treasures from a treasure vault in the Dragon King’s palace. Please take a look.”<br/><br/>As she spoke, she waved her arm and placed some divine herbs and divine artifacts aside.<br/><br/>The divine herbs were in bottles and it was obvious that they were valuable.<br/><br/>The divine artifacts were all very powerful. Two of them were acquired Numinous Treasures.<br/><br/>Other than these, there was also a pair of gloves with a huge golden claw.<br/><br/>The Golden Claw looked like it was made from a dragon claw. To be able to wear it on one’s hand, it was also an exceptionally powerful acquired Numinous Treasure.<br/><br/>“Is this all?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze across and asked with a twinkle in his eyes.<br/><br/>“Yes, Dragon King. When I entered the Dragon King’s Hall, I could only take these things out. Some of them are too powerful and I didn’t dare to touch them.”<br/><br/>“Also, I realized that the Tianhai Dragon King didn’t die.”<br/><br/>The female snake replied immediately.<br/><br/>“HMM, your bloodline isn’t weak. How did you get to such a state? Don’t you have any clansmen?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head and looked at the female snake. He asked curiously.<br/><br/>Through his senses, the female snake’s bloodline was very pure. At the very least, she could fight above her level.<br/><br/>In this universe, there was a watershed.<br/><br/>The universe wasn’t fair to begin with. Some races were born strong.<br/><br/>The strong with bloodlines and strong physiques would be of great help to their cultivation.<br/><br/>Later, some of the strong were divided into a few simple divisions.<br/><br/>Those with bloodlines and physiques that could fight above their level, as long as they developed steadily and had powerful spells, could reach the level of a mid-level race in the universe.<br/><br/>Those with bloodlines and physiques that could fight a level higher had powerful techniques and could reach the level of a high-level race in the universe.<br/><br/>And the peak races of today could fight a level higher than three.<br/><br/>This was the power of bloodlines and physiques.<br/><br/>The female snake’s bloodline power was very strong, and she could fight a level higher. However, she looked very miserable.<br/><br/>Once, she was chased by a universe knight, and once, she was chased by other demon beasts.<br/><br/>“I… I escaped from my race.”<br/><br/>The female snake lowered her head slightly and said with a slightly unwilling expression.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and didn’t ask further.<br/><br/>“Do you want to leave or stay in the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked him.<br/><br/>“I… I’ll stay in the Dragon Palace. It’s too dangerous outside.”<br/><br/>The female snake said weakly.<br/><br/>She had almost been killed twice. She was completely terrified.<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and instructed ao nu, “Bring her around.”<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King.”<br/><br/>Ao nu nodded and flew to the female snake’s side.<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze across the treasures. With a move of his palm, a box appeared in his hand.<br/><br/>It was a taboo item of the Heavenly Dragon Clan.<br/><br/>After hesitating for a moment, Wang Xian waved his arm and the soul-returning tree branch of the Fuchang tree landed on his body.<br/><br/>The Fuchang Tree and the soul-returning tree were both targeted at the soul. They should be able to withstand this weird taboo item.<br/><br/>Wang Xian opened the box and sized up the weird sculpture inside.<br/><br/>The weird sculpture was emitting a strange energy.<br/><br/>Wang Xian landed on the dragon tail on the lower half of the sculpture. Suddenly, he sensed a very familiar bloodline power.<br/><br/>His eyes were filled with astonishment. This dragon tail was forged with the blood of a purebred divine dragon.<br/><br/>“Dragon King.”<br/><br/>At this moment, the female snake who was brought away by Ao nu walked in.<br/><br/>She looked at the sculpture in Wang Xian’s hand with a shocked expression. Her eyes were filled with astonishment.<br/><br/>“Eh? Why are you here?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at her and raised his eyebrows slightly.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I sensed a strong attractive force, so I came over to take a look.”<br/><br/>The female snake spoke and her gaze landed on the statue.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
