To a universe knight with the light attribute, it was definitely a rare treasure.<br/><br/>This was especially so for a universe knight of level one or two. With this acquired Numinous Treasure, they could easily crush a universe knight of the same level.<br/><br/>“The starting price of a kalpa divine stone can be paid with pills and herbs of the same price.”<br/><br/>The white-robed old man of the Ancient Sea Race continued.<br/><br/>The Kalpa God stone represented time, and later on, it also represented a unit.<br/><br/>One kalpa god stone was equivalent to the amount of God stones produced by a top-tier planet over six billion years.<br/><br/>“The amount of God herbs and pills that can be bought with one kalpa god stone can increase the combat strength of a level five universe knight in the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled.<br/><br/>This was a very rich resource.<br/><br/>“One Kalpa realm divine stone at a Time!”<br/><br/>“One Kalpa realm divine stone at a Time!”<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>While Wang Xian was thinking, the auction had already started. The light-attributed universe knights raised their bids with fervent eyes.<br/><br/>Acquired spiritual treasure-grade weapons were still very popular.<br/><br/>There were hundreds of thousands of universe knights present at the auction this time. Among them, there were quite a number of light-attributed universe knights.<br/><br/>The intense competition started.<br/><br/>Acquired spiritual treasures were very precious in the surrounding starry sky.<br/><br/>And to the stronger races, most acquired spiritual treasures belonged to inheritance treasures.<br/><br/>This acquired spiritual treasure with light attributes took 10 minutes to complete.<br/><br/>The price came to the eight amount of God tribulation stones.<br/><br/>In the end, it was bought by a demon who was like a butterfly.<br/><br/>“Not bad, not bad. The resources of the eight amount of God tribulation stones can increase the combat strength of eight level five universe knights in the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was very satisfied with the price.<br/><br/>He sent five acquired spiritual treasures. If he used these resources, he could pile up three to four level six universe knights.<br/><br/>Right now, the Dragon Palace was lacking in high-end combat strength.<br/><br/>“I’ll find an opportunity to sell the rest of the acquired spiritual treasures.”<br/><br/>He mumbled.<br/><br/>The auction continued. However, compared to the first item, the price of the following items was much lower.<br/><br/>One item after another was auctioned off. Wang Xian looked at them and didn’t see any items that he would be interested in.<br/><br/>“According to the information from the ancient sea race, the acquired spiritual treasure is the most valuable treasure. In that case, I don’t think there are any treasures that I can use. Furthermore, the chances of me finding any treasures are even lower.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself.<br/><br/>They were all experts who had lived for hundreds of millions of years. They were forces that had existed for billions of years. The chances of finding any treasures here were almost zero.<br/><br/>“I want this golden robe. I hope everyone can give me some face.”<br/><br/>At the end of the auction, Wang Xian basically took a glance at the universal AI.<br/><br/>At this moment, a voice sounded. He raised his eyebrows slightly and looked over.<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>Many people in the auction venue also looked at the voice.<br/><br/>The voice came from a universe Knight Level 1 great being of the true God race.<br/><br/>“Since this brother of the true God race wants it, I won’t compete with you!”<br/><br/>Another voice came from the back. An old man of the plant department cupped his hands towards the bidder of the true God race.<br/><br/>“Hehe, thank you!”<br/><br/>The auctioneer of the upright god Race said faintly and raised his head slightly.<br/><br/>“Congratulations to this friend of the upright God race. Let’s continue the auction of the next item.”<br/><br/>At the front, the white-robed elder of the ancient sea race continued with a smile.<br/><br/>“F * ck, I sent this golden robe for auction. Now, it’s sold below the market price.”<br/><br/>“Shut up. If you don’t want to die, don’t waste your breath. Just buy the item from the upright God race. We don’t want to offend the upright God race. They are about to land. If you provoke them, they won’t care about the rules surrounding Lu Xingkong. There’s nothing they can do even if they kill you.”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian vaguely heard a voice coming from a mountain peak behind him.<br/><br/>He raised his eyebrows slightly and paid no attention to it.<br/><br/>The auction continued!<br/><br/>Three hours later, it was time for the finale item.<br/><br/>Seven acquired spiritual treasures.<br/><br/>The first finale item was still sent by Wang Xian. It was still an acquired spiritual treasure with the light attribute.<br/><br/>After a round of competition, the price was 7.5 divine stones. Wang Xian was rather satisfied with this.<br/><br/>The second item was a acquired treasure with fire attributes. It was auctioned off to nine amount of god-tribulation stones.<br/><br/>This gave Wang Xian a general understanding of acquired spiritual treasures.<br/><br/>The price should be between 7-10 amount of god-tribulation stones.<br/><br/>“The next item to be auctioned off is a metal-attribute acquired spiritual treasure, the void gold awl. It is a very terrifying offensive spiritual treasure. The starting price is still one amount of god-tribulation stones. The bidding starts now.”<br/><br/>On the auction stage, the old man in White said with a smile.<br/><br/>“Five robbery god Stones!”<br/><br/>The moment the bidding started, someone immediately made a bid.<br/><br/>Obviously, they understood that three or four robbery god stones weren’t enough to get a acquired spiritual treasure.<br/><br/>Hence, a universe knight immediately raised his bid to five robbery god stones.<br/><br/>“Five robbery god Stones, one robbery God stone. I’ll take this acquired spiritual treasure. Please give me face, Jin Zheng Fa!”<br/><br/>As soon as he finished speaking, a golden light shot into the sky. His voice was loud and clear, reaching everyone’s ears.<br/><br/>However, his words were extremely arrogant and domineering.<br/><br/>5.1 divine kalpa stones for this acquired numinous treasure was much, much lower.<br/><br/>One had to know that one divine kalpa stone was a considerable amount of resources.<br/><br/>The words of this powerhouse from the Orthodox god race immediately caused those who wanted to bid to frown slightly.<br/><br/>The white-robed elder in front was also slightly stunned. He pursed his lips and did not say anything.<br/><br/>Since the powerhouses from the Orthodox god race were so powerful, there was nothing they could do about it.<br/><br/>Moreover, all the powerhouses from the Orthodox god race were not far away.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard his bid, he frowned slowly.<br/><br/>This acquired spiritual treasure with metal attributes was auctioned by him. If he were to sell it at 5.01 points, he would suffer a huge loss.<br/><br/>“Haha, thank you for giving in!”<br/><br/>However, at the next moment, the expert of the righteous god race turned around and cupped his hands. He laughed out loud.<br/><br/>He was very domineering and decided the ownership of this spiritual treasure with metal attributes.<br/><br/>All the Great Beings in the auction looked at the golden light on his body and felt his power.<br/><br/>Although he only had the power of a universe Knight Level 4, he didn’t say anything and no one competed with him.<br/><br/>This was to give face to the true God race and show respect to them.<br/><br/>Even the old man who had just raised the price didn’t dare to raise it anymore.<br/><br/>“Alright, then congratulations to the Lord of the Righteous God race for obtaining this void Golden Awl.”<br/><br/>On the auction stage, the white-robed old man of the ancient sea race hesitated for a moment before he smiled and said.<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at this scene and frowned slightly.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
