If he wanted to break through to the peak of the Universe Overlord realm, he would need at least 500 million to 600 million years, or even one billion years.<br/><br/>Under such circumstances, he could only give up!<br/><br/>Roar!<br/><br/>“Hualala!”<br/><br/>On this day, just as Wang Xian was cultivating, an excited roar was heard!<br/><br/>The sudden roar caused the branches of the tree of chaos to tremble!<br/><br/>The leaves of the tree of chaos collided with each other!<br/><br/>A deafening sound was heard by everyone.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>The sudden situation stunned everyone. Their faces were filled with astonishment!<br/><br/>“What’s the situation? What kind of Roar is this? It feels so terrifying! ” “I don’t know. It’s on the right.”<br/><br/>“What a terrifying sound. Could it be a terrifying existence in the chaos?”<br/><br/>“Don’t worry. There are masters of the Heaven’s origin level here. We will be fine!<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, all the strong disciples heard the roar. Their faces were filled with shock.<br/><br/>The Roar shook their souls.<br/><br/>It was the same even for powerhouses at the peak of the Universe Dominator!<br/><br/>“What’s the situation?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian heard the roar and looked in that direction.<br/><br/>His body moved and flew in that direction rapidly.<br/><br/>At the same time, the Queen of the Elves was also flying in that direction rapidly!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian flew in front of the branches of the tree of chaos, three figures appeared in Wang Xian’s sight!<br/><br/>These were three very strange creatures.<br/><br/>They were like worms, one in the shape of a bucket. As they flew, they squirmed non-stop!<br/><br/>However, their speed was extremely fast.<br/><br/>Their bodies contained a grayish energy, and there was also an Earth attribute!<br/><br/>“Senior elven empress, what are these?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the elven empress and asked with a face full of astonishment!<br/><br/>“Beasts of chaos. Giant beasts born in the chaos. These three beasts of Chaos are helminth. ”<br/><br/>The Elven empress looked at the three beasts of chaos, her eyes were shining, “Worm beasts often appear around the tree of chaos. They also eat the leaves of the tree of chaos and live in the tree of chaos. In addition, worm beasts like to devour any living creature with flesh and blood. ”<br/><br/>“The weakest of the giant beasts born in the chaos should be at the initial stage of the Heavenly Fate Realm. These three worm beasts are at the initial stage of the Heavenly Fate Realm. We must stop them and kill them! ”<br/><br/>As the Elven empress spoke, a companion elf appeared on her shoulder!<br/><br/>In her hand, an elven staff appeared.<br/><br/>On her back was an elven bow!<br/><br/>“A beast of chaos that is comparable to the Heaven’s origin creation realm. Is It covered in treasures?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked over and his eyes sparkled!<br/><br/>“That is natural. In the chaos, other than the gray and lifeless energy, there are other things. If so, they are all treasures! ”<br/><br/>The elven empress said, “There are three beasts of chaos here. It will be difficult for us to destroy them. We need to get the other powerhouses to come over. ”<br/><br/>“Which powerhouses will be the fastest?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked!<br/><br/>“The twelve ancestral Wizards of the Wizard clan have set up a teleportation formation here. With their abilities, I estimate that they will be able to rush over in a month. The rest of the Heaven’s origin fortunes will take at least ten<br/><br/>The Elven empress spoke!<br/><br/>“Alright, I want one of the worm beasts. Senior Elven empress and the 12 ancestral wizards, you can split the other two!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke directly!<br/><br/>His words stunned the elven empress slightly. A look of astonishment appeared on her face.<br/><br/>“Are you confident?”<br/><br/>The Elven empress looked at Wang Xian and asked in astonishment!<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head confidently.<br/><br/>The Five Elements Millstone had already achieved a breakthrough.<br/><br/>With the addition of the Qilin ox and the five elements millstone, it was more than enough to destroy a beginner-level worm beast!<br/><br/>One had to know that the current strength of the Qilin ox was much stronger than Wang Xian’s. It was comparable to an old beginner-level Heaven’s origin creation!<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>The Elven empress was a little shocked, but she still nodded her head. “Alright, I’ll stop two of them first. I’ll leave the third one to you guys!”<br/><br/>“No Problem! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head. He gestured to the LINNIU beside him!<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar! ”<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar! ”<br/><br/>The LINNIU’s gaze was fixed on the three chaos helminth beasts in front of him. Similarly, he let out a low roar and his body expanded!<br/><br/>He transformed into a powerful demonic beast that was thousands of meters in size!<br/><br/>Wang Xian also let out a low growl as he transformed into the body of a divine dragon.<br/><br/>Compared to Lin Niu’s body, Wang Xian’s body of a divine dragon was countless times larger!<br/><br/>His body that was as huge as a meteorite in the starry sky locked onto the Chaos Helminth Beast on the leftmost side!<br/><br/>“Attack and kill it! ” Wang Xian ordered Lin Niu!<br/><br/>“Yes, Boss!”<br/><br/>Lin Niu replied loudly. His body moved and he flew over!<br/><br/>“Some of the Overlord disciples from the nine-origin universe can witness the battle between the Heaven’s origin destinies. Watch from the back and don ‘t get too close!”<br/><br/>The Elven empress said faintly.<br/><br/>She waved her arm and took the bow and arrow on her back. She then attacked the other two chaos helminth beasts!<br/><br/>Her face was filled with joy!<br/><br/>The Elven empress did not expect that there would be chaos beasts coming to the tree of chaos.<br/><br/>Most importantly, there were only three chaos beasts, and they were just at the heavenly fate level.<br/><br/>These Chaos Beasts could be killed!<br/><br/>To them, this was a huge treasure trove!<br/><br/>The Elven empress had only encountered such a good thing once in the past.<br/><br/>With the elven Empress’s strength, she could definitely kill one of them by herself.<br/><br/>This one would be her spoils of war.<br/><br/>As for the other two beasts of chaos, if Wang Xian could kill one of them, it would naturally belong to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>As for the last one, it would belong to whoever came first.<br/><br/>Of course, the one that came must be a control-level heavenly yuan creation. Otherwise, a beginner-level one would not be able to kill a beginner-level chaos beast!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
