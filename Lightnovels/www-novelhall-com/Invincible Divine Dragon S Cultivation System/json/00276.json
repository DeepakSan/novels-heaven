The two of them flew to the sky and opened a battlefield.<br/><br/>“Kill, Kill, Kill, kill the disciples of the Water Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>“Fire Cloud, Dragon Eagle, Ghost Dragon, Dark Claw, Battle Dragon, the five legions, attack.”<br/><br/>Devil Dragon Emperor stared at the experts from the Water Dragon Palace and roared loudly.<br/><br/>The Devil Dragon Bloodline, Fire Dragon Palace, and the Red Gold Battle Dragon they had tamed added up to more than 10,000 universe knights.<br/><br/>Other than the 10,000 universe knights, there were more than 10 million other dragon species. These dragon palaces were all void God emperor level existences.<br/><br/>This time, for the sake of annihilating water dragon palace, the four great dragon palaces had all arrived, and the disciples of the godly dragon lineage were all living in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>When the war broke out, they entered the battlefield immediately.<br/><br/>Similarly, the five to six million void God emperor level disciples of Water Dragon Palace also entered the battlefield to fight.<br/><br/>In terms of the number of universe knights, the Water Dragon Palace and the Dragon Palace were slightly weaker than the other party.<br/><br/>In terms of disciples of other ranks, they were still much weaker than the other party because the disciples of the Dragon Palace had yet to arrive.<br/><br/>However, the Water Dragon King, Wang Xian, and the others did not have the slightest fluctuation. This battle mainly depended on the high-end combat strength.<br/><br/>In the center, Water Dragon Emperor stared at Demon Dragon Emperor and felt his power. He was surprised.<br/><br/>Since demon dragon could subdue Fire Dragon Palace, he should have at least a level 6 universe knight. However, he was still a level 5 universe knight.<br/><br/>This didn’t make sense.<br/><br/>“A Level 5 universe knight can kill you all!”<br/><br/>Devil Dragon King roared and attacked Water Dragon King.<br/><br/>“Disciples of the Dragon Palace, set up the formation and kill, Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>Ao Qitian and Ao tu roared and rushed forward.<br/><br/>With the Imperial Dragon and Mad Dragon as the leaders, the central star Wood Dragon, the Sky Thunder Earth Fire Dragon and the Phoenix, the Arrow Dragon and the Charm Dragon formed a battle formation and rushed forward.<br/><br/>Close combat, long range, and support formed a system.<br/><br/>All of them were formed by pinnacle dragon species and rushed forward.<br/><br/>As for the poisonous horned dragon and the thorned dragon, they were all around to interfere with the assassination.<br/><br/>The 4,000 knights of the Dragon Palace and the group of Dragon Palaces formed a battle, it wasn’t something the Devil Dragon and Fire Dragon Palace could compare to.<br/><br/>Not only were all the dragon races from the three dragon palaces high-level dragon races, they were also good at close combat on the battlefield. Fire Cloud was good at long-range attacks, Dark Claw and Ghost Dragon were good at assassination, and Dragon Eagle was also good at close combat.<br/><br/>They were fighting on their own, and there was no such thing as a battle formation.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there were only about 1,000 high-level dragon races in total.<br/><br/>However, all the dragon palaces were the same.<br/><br/>The Mad Dragon and Imperial Dragon rushed forward and entangled over 1,000 universe knights.<br/><br/>The Mad Dragon’s attack and Imperial Dragon’s defense made the faces of the Great Beings from the Fire Dragon Palace change.<br/><br/>“Attack!”<br/><br/>The leader of the Fire Cloud Army roared, and flames flew toward the mad dragon at the front.<br/><br/>“Attack and Defense!”<br/><br/>Ao Qi and Ao tu roared.<br/><br/>They attacked instead of defense.<br/><br/>“Kill!”<br/><br/>“Charm, curse, Surrender!”<br/><br/>“Thunder Meteorite!”<br/><br/>“Willow Leaf Dragon Scale!”<br/><br/>In the next moment, long-range attacks, auxiliary attacks, and arrow attacks shot forward.<br/><br/>The front defended, and the back attacked.<br/><br/>“Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!”<br/><br/>The expressions of the universe knights who had not formed an army or a battle team changed drastically. Some of the weaker ones were killed instantly.<br/><br/>“Be careful of that sound wave. It’s very strange!”<br/><br/>“The defense of those guys in the front is too strong. The attacks from the back are too sharp!”<br/><br/>“Be careful!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the expressions of the thousands of universe knights changed drastically. The expression of the leader of the Fire Cloud Army, Dragon Eagle Army, changed drastically.<br/><br/>The defense at the front was strong, and the long-range attacks at the back were sharp.<br/><br/>Most importantly, they couldn’t break through the defense of the Mad Dragon and the Imperial Dragon.<br/><br/>The moment they couldn’t break through, the long-range attacks of the enemy would be random.<br/><br/>They could only passively block, but as long as they blocked, there would be mistakes.<br/><br/>Especially under the strange attacks of the charming dragon, the bodies of the dragons trembled, and confusion appeared in their eyes.<br/><br/>In this short moment, arrows pierced through their bodies.<br/><br/>Then, they were covered by the flaming willow leaves.<br/><br/>“Charge!”<br/><br/>Ao Qitian, Ao Tu, and the others saw the situation and roared. The wild dragon species and the imperial dragon species rushed forward.<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>“Damn it, why aren’t the Ghost Dragons attacking?”<br/><br/>“Attack! Wait for the Ghost Dragons to assassinate the experts behind the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>The leader of the Fire Cloud Group, the DRAGONHAWK leader, saw this scene and his face changed as he transmitted his voice.<br/><br/>“Now! Get ready to attack!”<br/><br/>The Ghost Dragon quickly circled around and attacked the archery dragon and the charming dragon.<br/><br/>Their figures flashed and a black light flashed.<br/><br/>“Puff! Puff! Puff!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the Ghost Dragon hidden in the darkness started to move.<br/><br/>The Ghost Dragon’s Hell Claw was a high-grade dragon type that could control the darkness.<br/><br/>However, the dragon-type hydralisk could control light and darkness. In terms of hiding ability, the Hell Claw and the Ghost Dragon were a level apart.<br/><br/>The dragon-type hydralisk had locked onto them long ago.<br/><br/>Just as the Ghost Dragon was about to attack, the dragon-type hydralisk also started to move.<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>“Not good, there are assassins around us. Be careful, their strength is very terrifying.”<br/><br/>“How is this possible, how did they escape our detection? How did they find us?”<br/><br/>“It’s those terrifying assassins, be careful!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the expressions of the members of Dark Claw and Ghost Dragon changed drastically.<br/><br/>As assassins, they were actually assassinated!<br/><br/>They knew that the other party’s concealment ability was much stronger than theirs.<br/><br/>A dragon that was even stronger than them?<br/><br/>“Devil Dragon King is a universe knight level five. Then the Devil Dragon Lineage definitely has a trump card. Aren’t they going to show it?”<br/><br/>At the same time, in the Water Dragon Palace, Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and raised his eyebrows slightly.<br/><br/>From the looks of the battle, the dragon and water dragon palaces had the upper hand.<br/><br/>If they continued to fight, they would win.<br/><br/>After all, the dragon seed of the Dragon Palace was a level stronger than the Fire Dragon Palace of the Devil Dragon lineage. The dragon seed was also richer and their coordination was stronger.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace alone could hold back the elites of the Devil Dragon bloodline and the Fire Dragon Palace. The rest of the Water Dragon Palace could also deal with them easily!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
