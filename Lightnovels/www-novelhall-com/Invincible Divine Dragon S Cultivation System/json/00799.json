The Declaration Was Boiling!</h1><div class=\"entry-content\" id=\"htmlContent\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3792 3791 was completely annihilated. The declaration was boiling!<br/><br/>“He’s dead, our Lord is dead!”<br/><br/>“Our senior Tian was killed by the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>“It’s over, it’s over!”<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>When the Water Phoenix, who was at the seventh level of the ruler realm, was killed by the Dragon King, all the powerful disciples of the Phoenix clan completely collapsed.<br/><br/>Their bodies trembled as they watched this scene.<br/><br/>It was over!<br/><br/>They were going to die!<br/><br/>They were going to be killed by the Dragon King!<br/><br/>The archangel of drought and their senior Phoenix were all killed by the Dragon King in an instant.<br/><br/>Then what could they use to resist?<br/><br/>“Quick, quick, quickly enter the teleportation array. Royal clan, open your defenses!”<br/><br/>An angel of the level six realm roared crazily at the royal clan’s experts!<br/><br/>With this teleportation array in the long corridor, they could teleport.<br/><br/>The teleportation array might be their only chance to escape!<br/><br/>“What the F * ck?”<br/><br/>When the experts of the royal family heard the words of this expert of the Angel clan, their faces turned black?<br/><br/>What the F * ck? Are You Dreaming?<br/><br/>The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is so fierce now?<br/><br/>Should we open the defense and help you escape?<br/><br/>Wouldn’t we be enemies with the Dragon Palace and the Dragon King?<br/><br/>Is it possible?<br/><br/>Even if they were confident that they could kill the Dragon King with the defense here, they wouldn’t be able to kill him completely.<br/><br/>Only a fool would do such a thing.<br/><br/>“Angel clan, Phoenix Clan, our royal clan will not be involved in the conflict between you and the Dragon Palace. It’s good enough that our royal clan didn’t say anything when you attacked on our territory!”<br/><br/>“Do you want us to make enemies with the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>An expert from the royal family spoke directly!<br/><br/>At the same time, he was sending a message to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>It was that he didn’t want to make enemies with the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>It was just that he had no other choice.<br/><br/>The expression of the expert from the angel race changed drastically when he heard that.<br/><br/>“Hehe, I came here this time to kill all of you. If I don’t let you go, none of you can escape!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at them and said coldly!<br/><br/>He had killed two angels and Phoenixes who were at the seventh level. The next ones who were at the sixth level would only need four netherspirit avatars.<br/><br/>No matter how many powerhouses there were in the angel race and Phoenix race, their realms would be suppressed. If they worked together, they could at most withstand two of them.<br/><br/>Facing the attacks of the four netherspirit avatars, they had no way to retaliate!<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved and came to the opposite side of Lan Qingyue. He sat there with a smile on his face.<br/><br/>“Hehe!”<br/><br/>Lan qingyue smiled at him.<br/><br/>Wang Xian took a sip of his tea and quietly watched the battle at the side.<br/><br/>“This is a one-sided massacre!”<br/><br/>“The gap is too big. The Dragon King is too terrifying now!”<br/><br/>“The Dragon King actually sat back at his original seat and drank his tea. This… this is completely disregarding the angel and Phoenix Clans!”<br/><br/>“The Angel Race and the Phoenix race have suffered great losses ever since they became enemies with the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>“I heard that the Angel Race’s third ancestor of the Radiant Angels and the Phoenix Race’s Green River Water Phoenix have been trying to kill the Dragon King and destroy the Dragon Palace for some reason. I don’t know what they’re feeling right now!”<br/><br/>Everyone looked at this scene and discussed in shock!<br/><br/>This battle was too shocking.<br/><br/>After this battle, all the peak races wouldn’t look down on the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>At least in the starry universe, the Dragon King wasn’t afraid of any peak races!<br/><br/>The Dragon King was able to kill the Angels and Phoenixes by himself. One could imagine that if the Dragon King was facing a peak race, that peak race would have an even bigger headache!<br/><br/>Screams continued to ring out as the experts of the Angels and Phoenixes were quickly killed.<br/><br/>In the end, the screams completely disappeared. There was only an angel and a phoenix floating in the air.<br/><br/>They were only at the venerable realm, and their faces were filled with fear and despair.<br/><br/>Seeing that the Dragon King did not kill them, they were also shocked and at a loss!<br/><br/>“Go back and tell the powerhouses of the angel race and the Phoenix race to send over the heads of the third Prince of the Radiant Angel race and the Green River Water Phoenix. All of these grudges will end. If not, I will kill all of you who stepped into the starry universe!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said coldly to the last remaining Angel and Phoenix!<br/><br/>When the angel and Phoenix heard this, their bodies trembled.<br/><br/>“Yes, yes!”<br/><br/>They nodded their heads in horror and fled into the distance after surviving the calamity!<br/><br/>They fled!<br/><br/>They didn’t expect that they would be able to return alive!<br/><br/>This was simply the protection of the nine-origin Universe!<br/><br/>“This… Dragon King’s words are so overbearing. He wants the angel and Phoenix clans to send over the heads of the third prince and the Green River Water Phoenix?”<br/><br/>“Wow, Dragon King’s words are so cool. The angel and Phoenix clans will definitely not take the heads of the third prince and the Green River Water Phoenix over. Bi Dragon King is going to fight them to the end!”<br/><br/>“In the starry universe, there is the suppression of the universe, and the level 8 ruler realm can not come over. With the strength that Dragon King has displayed, the angel and Phoenix clans will be in trouble!”<br/><br/>“The main reason is that the dragon king is growing too fast. Did the Dragon King get all the inheritance of the Divine Dragon Race?”<br/><br/>“It’s possible!”<br/><br/>All the powerful disciples of the peak races and the disciples of the high-level races said in shock.<br/><br/>The Dragon King’s words were too cruel!<br/><br/>At the same time, his words were a real declaration of war against the Angel race and the Phoenix race.<br/><br/>They were going to expel them from the universe!<br/><br/>“The Angel race and the Phoenix race are going to be in trouble this time!”<br/><br/>Some level 7 masters thought to themselves.<br/><br/>They looked at the Dragon King and knew that they would also be killed instantly if they faced him!<br/><br/>The Dragon King’s foundation was too deep!<br/><br/>The news of the Dragon King’s arrival spread through the communication stone plate at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>Moreover, before the war broke out, the news of the Dragon King’s arrival at the trading gallery had already caused a huge sensation.<br/><br/>At this moment, the news immediately caused all the powerful disciples of the nine-origin universe to be in an uproar.<br/><br/>It encompassed all the peak races.<br/><br/>“How is this possible?”<br/><br/>“The Dragon King, the Dragon King, has the strength to instantly kill a Master of the seventh level?”<br/><br/>“The Angel clan and the Phoenix clan, together, have killed more than 5,000 strong disciples?”<br/><br/>“Hiss, this can’t be a joke, right? Is It True?”<br/><br/>All the strong disciples asked in shock on the communication stone plate.<br/><br/>The strong disciples of the top races also sent messages to ask if the news was true.<br/><br/>After receiving confirmation, all the disciples took a deep breath.<br/><br/>So terrifying!<br/><br/>So terrifying!<br/><br/>“In the starry universe, the Dragon Palace already has the strength to contend with the top races!”<br/><br/>This was the evaluation of a top race expert!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
