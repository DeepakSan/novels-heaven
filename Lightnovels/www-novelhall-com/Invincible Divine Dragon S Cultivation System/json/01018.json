Compared to Saint Sons and Saintesses and heaven’s pride disciples, there were more ordinary disciples.<br/><br/>Many ordinary disciples who were universe masters didn’t even have innate true treasures.<br/><br/>This phenomenon was even more obvious in the forbidden space.<br/><br/>In the forbidden space, the current generation of Saint Children and saintesses only had two innate supreme treasures.<br/><br/>This was because space-type treasures were extremely rare.<br/><br/>If they were not saint children and saintesses, only the more advanced heaven’s pride disciples would have them.<br/><br/>Now that Wang Xian had taken out 40 innate supreme treasures, it really shocked them!<br/><br/>Senior brother, he is that Saint Son Wang Xian. He obtained a large number of resources and treasures from the cosmic ruins. He also obtained the demonic pillar of a spatial-attributed expert. In addition, he also possesses an incomparably powerful sword technique! ”<br/><br/>“His sword technique is very terrifying. You can take a look! ”<br/><br/>At the side, Saint Son Xu ni walked to the front of a few senior brothers who were masters of the universe and were at the level six realm. He transmitted his voice to them!<br/><br/>The senior brothers nodded slightly and looked forward!<br/><br/>At the front, Wang Xian condensed sword mounds with sharp swords to form a sword array.<br/><br/>The sword array condensed into a sharp sword and unleashed a terrifying attack.<br/><br/>It suppressed the three hunters and demons throughout the entire process!<br/><br/>From time to time, during the battle, he would use his own energy to set up the sword mounds and turn them into a sword array to launch a joint attack!<br/><br/>The attack power was abnormally terrifying!<br/><br/>“This sword technique! ”<br/><br/>When Xu Ni and the rest of the senior brothers saw Wang Xian’s sword technique, they had solemn expressions on their faces.<br/><br/>Their eyes were fixed on him and their expressions changed slightly.<br/><br/>“Wang Xian is really powerful. He was able to suppress the three hunter demons even when they were in a berserk state. He’s really powerful! ”<br/><br/>“Yeah, he is indeed powerful. You have to know that holy son Wang Xian has already killed one. ”<br/><br/>“What spatial sword technique did holy son Wang Xian use? He is really powerful. His strength is even more powerful than Holy Son Wu Man and Holy Maiden Liu Yue. I reckon that the two of them would have to join forces to fight against him! ”<br/><br/>Gasps of astonishment could be heard from the surroundings. The group of Holy Sons and Holy Maidens and heaven’s favorites were discussing among themselves.<br/><br/>The battle was still going on!<br/><br/>More than ten hours later, at Wang Xian’s place, the three demon hunters wanted to escape.<br/><br/>That’s right.<br/><br/>They wanted to escape!<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! ”<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the three demon hunters were covered in blood. The Aura on their bodies was much weaker than before!<br/><br/>They let out a loud roar in unison and immediately fled into the distance!<br/><br/>Sou<br/><br/>At this moment, a great being in the forbidden space below moved and instantly launched an attack on the demon hunters that were fleeing!<br/><br/>The space attribute of a level six universe master was still extremely suppressive against Demon Beasts of the same level!<br/><br/>The terrifying attacks heavily injured one demon hunter after another!<br/><br/>Soon, three demon hunters were killed!<br/><br/>The Savage Saint and the flowing moon Saintess who were dealing with the four demon beasts felt this scene and their bodies exploded.<br/><br/>They immediately fled into the distance.<br/><br/>However, they were easily killed by the experts of the forbidden space! “Thank you for your help, Senior Brothers!”<br/><br/>The Savage Saint and the others looked at the experts of the forbidden space and cupped their hands to express their gratitude.<br/><br/>Since the other party had rushed over to support them, they should express their gratitude!<br/><br/>“Hehe, there’s no need for that. We were nearby, so we rushed over as well!”<br/><br/>The experts from the forbidden space shook their heads and said with a smile. (‘I still have to thank my senior brothers. The demon hunters that my senior brothers killed belong to you!”<br/><br/>The flowing moon Saintess also expressed her gratitude!<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew over and cupped his hands to them!<br/><br/>“Alright, we won’t be polite about this. Junior brothers and sisters, you can continue your training. Let’s go to the next level! ”<br/><br/>The group of experts from the forbidden space smiled and took away the corpses of the hunters and demonic beasts that they had hunted.<br/><br/>Then, they waved their hands and left immediately!<br/><br/>“Phew, it’s all thanks to the presence of Saint Son Wang Xian that we were able to last for so long. I really didn’t expect that your strength is so strong. You’re much stronger than me! ”<br/><br/>The Saint Man looked at Wang Xian and said with a sigh!<br/><br/>“Hehe! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled gently. He hesitated for a moment before looking at the Saint Man and the rest. “Everyone, Pm going to act alone next. ”<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s sudden words stunned the Saint Man and the rest!<br/><br/>However, they soon understood something.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was a spatial attribute cultivator. His strength was stronger than all of them combined.<br/><br/>He could teleport away instantly when he encountered powerful demonic beasts.<br/><br/>He would be dragged down if he were to be with them!<br/><br/>“That’s true. With your strength, it’s more suitable for you to act alone. If it were us, we would be dragging you down a little! ”<br/><br/>The flowing moon Saintess nodded her head slightly and said!<br/><br/>“Since you want to act alone, we won’t force you. Next, pay attention to your safety!<br/><br/>The Barbarian saint also nodded his head and said!<br/><br/>“We are indeed a burden to you. You must pay attention to your safety when you act alone. ”<br/><br/>The rest of the saint sons and Saintesses also said!<br/><br/>“Brother Wang Xian! ”<br/><br/>Long Yin Yin and long Yin Hao looked at Wang Xian and shouted, “You must pay attention to your safety. ”<br/><br/>“Yeah, you guys pay attention to your safety too. I’ll be fine! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and looked at Saint Wu Man and Saintess Liu Yue. “I’ll have to trouble brother Wu Man and Saintess Liu Yue to take care of my junior brothers and sisters. They are relatively weaker compared to each other!” “No problem. Don’t worry about brother Wang Xian. ”<br/><br/>When the saint son heard Wang Xian’s change in address, he also smiled and<br/><br/>promised!<br/><br/>He knew that this could be considered a small favor.<br/><br/>In the future, their relationship could be closer!<br/><br/>They had witnessed Wang Xian’s strength. If he continued to grow in the future, he might become the strongest person under the Heaven’s origin.<br/><br/>This was not impossible!<br/><br/>“Don ‘t worry. ”<br/><br/>The flowing moon Saintess nodded with a smile.<br/><br/>“Alright, we will meet again in a while. The corpses of these demonic beasts will be at your disposal! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian cupped his hands at them and left immediately!<br/><br/>The Barbarian Saint Son, the flowing moon Saintess, and the rest waved their hands!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Wang Xian disappeared in a flash.<br/><br/>Right now, his void dragon body was still a little weak in Wang Xian’s eyes.<br/><br/>However, he was no longer on the same level as the barbarian Saint Son and the rest!<br/><br/>There was no way he could train with them.<br/><br/>He was prepared to act alone and find some resources to train himself!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
