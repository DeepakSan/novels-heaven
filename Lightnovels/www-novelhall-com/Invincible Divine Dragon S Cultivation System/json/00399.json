Even a desolate beast could control an innate numinous treasure.<br/><br/>The Thunder Horn on the head of the Purple Thunder snake contained a terrifying amount of energy.<br/><br/>“I really didn’t expect a desolate beast to have such good luck!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled as he scanned the three desolate beasts that were at the peak of the Universe Knight Realm from behind.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>At this moment, the terrifying Thunderbolts in the middle of the three desolate beasts slowly disappeared. A Purple Treasure Phantom appeared in their line of sight.<br/><br/>It was a purple treasure that was as big as a bell. It was the size of a human head and was located at the bottom of the bell. Bolts of lightning were rotating and terrifying thunderbolts were being nurtured inside.<br/><br/>“This is an innate spiritual treasure!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at the bell-like innate spiritual treasure. His eyes were glowing.<br/><br/>An innate spiritual treasure was also a treasure to the Masters of the universe.<br/><br/>For such a treasure, the Lightning race might not have more than three of them, or even only one.<br/><br/>In the heaven-opening primal continent, it was also an extremely precious treasure.<br/><br/>To be able to obtain such a treasure was purely a great opportunity.<br/><br/>Such a treasure could greatly enhance the combat strength of a universe knight.<br/><br/>“If I sell such a treasure, I can increase my strength!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled as his gaze swept across the three desolate beasts that were at the pinnacle of universe knights.<br/><br/>The combat strength of these three desolate beasts was on the same level as him. However, with Wang Xian’s combat strength and the five elements grinding, he could completely suppress them.<br/><br/>However, it might be a little difficult to kill them, especially for the purple lightning snake.<br/><br/>None of the desolate beasts that could mature to such an extent were simple.<br/><br/>The lightning energy around the bell-like innate spiritual treasure slowly disappeared. The energy that Wang Xian and the three desolate beasts were afraid of also disappeared bit by bit.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s gaze locked onto the innate spiritual treasure. The five elements millstone slowly appeared in his palm.<br/><br/>When the innate spiritual treasure was completely unearthed, Wang Xian and the three desolate beasts started to move at the same time.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>Roars were emitted from the mouths of the three desolate beasts.<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>The Thunder Horn on the head of the Purple Thunder Snake released a terrifying lightning beam and attacked the desolate beasts on both sides directly.<br/><br/>Its coiled body moved rapidly towards the innate spiritual treasure.<br/><br/>“Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>“CHIRP CHIRP!”<br/><br/>The thundermale ape and the Thundercloud Vulture let out a rapid sound. They immediately launched an attack and used their thunder technique to grab the innate spiritual treasure.<br/><br/>“Do it!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this scene, he did not hesitate and rushed over.<br/><br/>Once the innate spiritual treasure was obtained by the desolate beasts, once they kept it in their nest, it would be difficult for him to obtain it.<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>The five elements millstone in his hand smashed towards the three desolate beasts. On the five elements millstone, all sorts of treasures began to condense as they charged towards the three desolate beasts.<br/><br/>Ice Sword, Scarlet Yang, Golden Pagoda, Thorn, and so on. They looked like hundreds of treasures.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>When the three desolate beasts saw the sudden terrifying attack, their expressions changed drastically as they immediately looked at the five elements millstone.<br/><br/>The attack from the five elements millstone had completely covered them. They could not ignore it.<br/><br/>Otherwise, they would be seriously injured.<br/><br/>The three desolate beasts immediately blocked the attack from the five elements millstone.<br/><br/>“Crash!”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian flapped his divine wings and grabbed at the connate numinous treasure at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>When the purple lightning snake sensed Wang Xian’s appearance, it let out an angry roar and charged up its energy at the Lightning Horn.<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>The continuous attacks covered the entire area, including all the dire beasts and Wang Xian.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw the power of the lightning, his expression turned slightly ugly.<br/><br/>Currently, Wang Xian’s greatest trump card was his speed. With his speed at the Overlord level, he could easily defeat or even insta-kill an opponent of the same level.<br/><br/>However, there was an advantage to this. It was either to catch his opponent off guard or to continuously exhaust his opponent.<br/><br/>With his speed, what he feared the most was an area-of-effect attack and an extremely powerful defense.<br/><br/>After all, Wang Xian’s defense was not enough for him to ignore the attack of a peak universe knight.<br/><br/>The indiscriminate attack made him stop moving and he hurriedly dodged to the side.<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>A domain of thunder and lightning was formed around the innate spiritual treasure.<br/><br/>The attacks of the three desolate beasts also collided with the Five Elements Grand Mill.<br/><br/>The Five Elements Grand Mill was fighting against three of them at the same time. It was a little difficult, but it was impossible to trap them.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was floating in the air. He kept flapping his primaless sacred wings and a cold expression appeared on his face.<br/><br/>“Since you don’t want me to obtain it, I’ll deal with the three of You First!”<br/><br/>With a low growl, his arm turned into a dragon claw and attacked the purple lightning snake directly.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>Five Divine Dragons roared on the five elements grinding mill and attacked the thundermale ape and Thundercloud vulture directly.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>When the purple lightning snake saw Wang Xian attacking it, its cold eyes were filled with a bloodthirsty look.<br/><br/>It shook its huge body, and its horns emitted a luster as it charged directly at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Humph!”<br/><br/>Seeing the purple lightning snake charging towards him, Wang Xian snorted softly. He flapped his incipient saint wings and instantly arrived at the side of the purple lightning snake.<br/><br/>The Dragon Claw landed heavily on it.<br/><br/>“PFFT!”<br/><br/>The Dragon Claw landed and tore a huge wound. The energy from the destruction of the five elements surged into it.<br/><br/>“Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>It let out a painful roar as its snake tail swept towards Wang Xian.<br/><br/>The terrifying thunder force seemed to be able to sweep everything away.<br/><br/>“Crash!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s figure flashed once again. He arrived behind the head of the purple lightning snake and slashed his dragon claw once again.<br/><br/>“PFFT!”<br/><br/>A large number of wounds appeared once again. Wang Xian’s speed made it unable to react in time.<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>After witnessing Wang Xian’s speed, the purple lightning snake revealed a violent look in its eyes. The Thunder all over its body exploded. A large-scale thunder attack covered the surrounding area.<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>In the next moment, Wang Xian instantly left the range of the Lightning attack. A smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>In a one-on-one fight, even if the opponent had an innate spiritual treasure, Wang Xian could easily kill the opponent.<br/><br/>Speed was his greatest advantage.<br/><br/>Roar! Roar<br/><br/>The furious purple lightning snake saw this scene and raised its head to glare at Wang Xian. It was burning with rage.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>The lightning horns on its head condensed into numerous lightning horns and attacked its surroundings without any difference. At the same time, it grabbed towards the innate spiritual treasure.<br/><br/>It wanted to force Wang Xian to fight against it!<br/><br/>“HMPH!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this scene, his expression turned cold. The tai chi dragon coiled around him and the wind and thunder powers were also attached to the Tai Chi Dragon coiled. He charged towards the purple lightning snake below.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
