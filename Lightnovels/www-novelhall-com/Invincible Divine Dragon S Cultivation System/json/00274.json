They are not weaker than the Water Dragon Palace. The Red Gold War Dragon and the Dragon Palace of the wind and thunder lineage are weaker, but they are also very terrifying.”<br/><br/>“They are suppressing the water dragon palace with the four dragon palaces. Are they trying to break through the defense of the Water Dragon Palace by force?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian scanned his surroundings as his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>These were all powerful dragon palaces. The four great dragon palaces, the Water Dragon Palace, and the Dark World of the Demon Dragon were all masters of the universe.<br/><br/>“If we can destroy them this time, it will be an opportunity for the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>“They completely surrounded us and didn’t attack us immediately. The lineage of the demon dragon is really confident!”<br/><br/>The Water Dragon King said in a deep voice.<br/><br/>He was even more fearful of the Demonic Dragon Clan’s strength.<br/><br/>“Powerful. As expected of the Dragon Palace left behind by a peak Divine Dragon clan expert. It’s really powerful!”<br/><br/>On the light lotus outside, the Saint Wen clan saw that the water dragon palace had been completely sealed and felt the power of the dragon palaces. Their eyes were filled with envy.<br/><br/>“We have two purposes this time. One is to destroy the Dragon Palace, and the other is to suppress the Space Beast.”<br/><br/>The holy prose clan elder Said and glanced at the people around him, “We don’t need to fight with the Devil Dragon Clan for the other treasures. Now that the Fire Dragon Palace has submitted, we are no longer their match.”<br/><br/>“It’s the Clan Elder. We know our limits.”<br/><br/>The experts of the holy prose clan nodded with a grim look in their eyes.<br/><br/>They were quite confident in dealing with the dragon palace.<br/><br/>Time passed bit by bit, and the ten-day limit was getting closer and closer.<br/><br/>The entire surrounding starry sky was paying attention to the battle here, and no one dared to get close to watch such a huge race war.<br/><br/>“Break the defense of the Water Dragon Palace, Attack!”<br/><br/>When the ten-day limit arrived, a voice came from the dark realm of the Demon Dragon.<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>After the order was given, the Demon Dragon Bloodline, the Fire Dragon Palace, the Red Gold War Dragon, and all the Divine Dragons responded immediately.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>In the next moment, the four dragon palaces burst out with terrifying power.<br/><br/>Flames, darkness, red gold, and lightning shot toward the Water Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“They are about to make their move. What a terrifying aura. They want to break the defense of the Water Dragon Palace through the might of the four great dragon palaces.”<br/><br/>At this moment, all the members of the Water Dragon Palace, Wang Xian, and the rest of the members of the Dragon Palace were gathered in the area in front of the Dragon Gate of the Water Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>As they sensed the bugle call of the four great dragon palaces, their eyes focused.<br/><br/>Crack! Crack! Crack<br/><br/>At this moment, the water defense of the dragon gates in front of them began to collapse.<br/><br/>The power of the four great dragon palaces was enough to break through the Dragon Gates of the Water Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“All Disciples of the Water Dragon Palace, prepare to kill the enemy!”<br/><br/>The Water Dragon King roared furiously when he saw this.<br/><br/>“All Disciples of the Devil Dragon Bloodline, prepare to attack.”<br/><br/>“Fire Dragon, the Dragon Palace and the Water Dragon Palace are still defending this place. They should have some trump cards. Let the Saint Wen clan test the power of the Dragon Palace first. You attack the Water Dragon King and the others. I’ll wait for an opportunity and destroy them today.”<br/><br/>In the dark sector above, the voice of the dragon emperor resounded in the minds of all his subordinates.<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>Fire Dragon Emperor replied immediately.<br/><br/>This time, the Dragon Palace and Water Dragon Palace were defending. After seeing that he had the power of a level 6 knight, they should be able to guess that the dragon bloodline was stronger.<br/><br/>Under such circumstances, if they didn’t retreat, they should have some trump cards.<br/><br/>At this moment, the holy prose clan was a good bait.<br/><br/>“Attack!”<br/><br/>As the order was given, Dragon species flew out from the three great dragon palaces.<br/><br/>In the sky, in the Demonic Dragon Dark World, the Demonic Dragon King led his subordinates and swooped down to attack the Water Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The war had completely erupted!<br/><br/>“Face the enemy, kill, kill them!”<br/><br/>The Water Dragon King ordered loudly with a cold expression.<br/><br/>“Kill!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and gave the order to counterattack.<br/><br/>One by one, the prickly dragon species disappeared. The rest of the dragon species formed a battle formation and rushed out of the Water Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Woo Woo!”<br/><br/>Xiao Lan flew out of the Water Dragon Palace as well. Her huge eyes scanned the surroundings as she charged forward with a primitive aura.<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not make a move. He was waiting for the experts of the demonic dragon lineage.<br/><br/>In today’s battle, Wang Xian not only wanted to win, but he also wanted to obtain the four dragon palaces.<br/><br/>Once he obtained them, the devouring dragon would receive a terrifying upgrade.<br/><br/>“Dragon Palace, you killed the elders of my Saint Wen Clan. Today, we will make you pay with blood. We will make you pay thousands of times the price!”<br/><br/>On the light lotus, all the Great Beings of the holy prose clan saw the war break out and saw little blue’s huge body fly out. They roared coldly.<br/><br/>They flew out of the light lotus one by one, and the terrifying power of universe knights exploded from their bodies.<br/><br/>The power of nearly 4,000 universe knights exploded together, and the entire sky changed color.<br/><br/>The mighty energy impacted the surrounding starry sky for billions of miles.<br/><br/>“Humph!”<br/><br/>The clan elder of the holy prose clan snorted coldly and stood in the middle of the radiant lotus. A beam of holy light spread out in the surroundings.<br/><br/>The petals formed from the condensed light spread out for a radius of one billion kilometers.<br/><br/>“These bunch of people who are taking advantage of the situation.”<br/><br/>Some of the powerhouses of the Water Dragon Palace looked at them with unusually gloomy expressions.<br/><br/>Wang Xian saw the commotion and narrowed his eyes slightly.<br/><br/>“An lie, I’ll leave it to you!”<br/><br/>He looked at an lie and said with a smile.<br/><br/>“Haha, Dragon King, no problem.”<br/><br/>An lie replied in a low voice. His face was filled with confidence. “Today, I, an lie, will fight against a race alone.”<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>He let out an excited roar and disappeared in the next moment.<br/><br/>“Fire Dragon Palace of the Devil Dragon Bloodline, leave the space beast to us.”<br/><br/>In the sky, the Patriarch of the holy prose clan locked his eyes on Little Blue and roared in a low voice.<br/><br/>“Kill!”<br/><br/>Then, he ordered all the venerables of the holy prose clan to move.<br/><br/>In an instant, attacks came from all directions toward the Water Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“The little holy prose clan wants to take advantage of the situation and destroy our Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>“Puff!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a voice entered the ears of the Patriarch of the Holy Prose Clan.<br/><br/>However, soon after, he felt a sharp dagger flash by. Just as he was about to react, he sensed that his life force was rapidly draining away.<br/><br/>“Puff! Puff! Puff!”<br/><br/>Soon after, a series of penetrating sounds were heard, and his consciousness gradually became blurry.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
