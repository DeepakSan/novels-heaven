He took out the universal AI and sent some messages.<br/><br/>After the messages were sent, he waited quietly.<br/><br/>The matters of the Divine Dragon Island were too big, and he couldn’t make the decision.<br/><br/>Not long after, messages came one by one. After he saw them, he nodded to the king of angels of light.<br/><br/>They agreed!<br/><br/>They all agreed.<br/><br/>The Angels and the Phoenix tribe immediately sent the message to Prime Minister Gui.<br/><br/>Soon, Wang Xian received the message that they agreed.<br/><br/>“So straightforward?”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian received the message from them, he was stunned.<br/><br/>“Looks like I’m asking for too little.”<br/><br/>He couldn’t help but feel a little regretful.<br/><br/>Of course, even though he felt that he needed too little, getting the Divine Dragon Island back together with all the resources was already enough to satisfy Wang Xian.<br/><br/>His strength would increase drastically.<br/><br/>An existence that was comparable to a ruler of level nine, coupled with the Tai Chi Dragon Disc and the Five Elements Millstone, would be enough for him to be comparable to an existence at the peak of the ruler realm.<br/><br/>Of course, this would require him to complete the upgrade!<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace does not wish to be enemies with any of the peak races. In the future, when the disciples of the Dragon Palace are active in the starry universe, I hope that we can have a fair competition.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian took out his communication stone plate and released a message.<br/><br/>Everyone could understand this message.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace had already reconciled with the two peak races!<br/><br/>“Oh? The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace has released a message. What does this message mean?”<br/><br/>“It means that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is willing to reconcile with the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan. It must be that the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan have taken out enough treasures to tempt the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>“It’s inevitable. I just don’t know what price they have paid. It seems that the dispute between the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan and the Dragon Palace is coming to an end with the victory of the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>“They witnessed the rise of the Dragon Palace and the Great War. The Dragon Palace is really going against the tide!”<br/><br/>In the communication stone plate, countless powerful disciples were discussing.<br/><br/>This result didn’t surprise too many powerful disciples.<br/><br/>Now that the Dragon Palace and the Phoenix clan of the Angel clan were enemies, there weren’t many benefits.<br/><br/>If they reconciled with the other party, they could gain a lot of benefits!<br/><br/>When this news came out, very quickly, another piece of news quickly spread on the universe ai.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace would return to the Divine Dragon Island and rebuild the glory of the Divine Dragon Clan!<br/><br/>This news spread crazily on the universe AI, and all the powerful disciples in the starry universe also received this news.<br/><br/>“So it was a transaction with the Divine Dragon Island, and now that the Divine Dragon Island is occupied by the Phoenix clan, now it seems that the Phoenix clan has paid the price of the Divine Dragon Island!”<br/><br/>“Although it’s returned to its original owner, it’s still a base for a peak race. The grotto-heaven is definitely very powerful.”<br/><br/>“Does this count as the return of the Divine Dragon?”<br/><br/>The powerful disciples discussed.<br/><br/>The Divine Dragon Island belonged to the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>This also meant that the Divine Dragon had returned.<br/><br/>The thirteen peak races had gathered again.<br/><br/>In the nine-origin universe, Prime Minister Gui immediately went to the passage between the nine-origin universe and the starry universe to complete the trade with them.<br/><br/>A large amount of resources were handed over to Prime Minister Gui.<br/><br/>At the same time, Prime Minister Gui and more than ten masters in the ruler realm of the Dragon Palace flew towards the direction of the Divine Dragon Island.<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not return immediately because he was afraid that there was a trap.<br/><br/>His existence and Lan Qingyue’s existence were the best deterrence to the Phoenix and Angel clans.<br/><br/>Therefore, Wang Xian had to be careful!<br/><br/>“I wonder what treasures and paradises will be found on the Divine Dragon Island.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes revealed a look of anticipation.<br/><br/>That was the lair that the Divine Dragon Clan had been operating ever since the last calamity.<br/><br/>“Divine Dragon Island!”<br/><br/>At the same time, it was located in the sky above the ocean of the mountain and sea.<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui and more than a dozen experts of the Dragon Palace who were at the first level of the Dominator realm were flying rapidly.<br/><br/>The Divine Dragon Island was located in the ocean of the mountains and seas. Now that all the space beasts in the mountains and seas had left, it was much safer here.<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui and the others stared ahead, their eyes full of excitement and anticipation.<br/><br/>After all, that was the foundation of the Divine Dragon Clan!<br/><br/>As they got closer and closer, they had a feeling that they were connected by blood.<br/><br/>This feeling was as if they had returned to their mother’s embrace.<br/><br/>They continued flying, and soon, one island after another appeared. Each island looked like a divine dragon.<br/><br/>There were gold, green, green, red, white, and black…<br/><br/>Each island had a majestic energy.<br/><br/>“Prime minister turtle, this… Each island that looks like a divine dragon represents a powerful grotto-heaven blessed land. There are actually ninety-nine islands that look like a divine dragon!”<br/><br/>The water dragon leader stared at the islands that looked like divine dragons with excitement in his eyes.<br/><br/>On these islands, they could feel the power of the origin and a power that made their blood boil.<br/><br/>“Every peak race’s base has a grotto-heaven blessed land that is no weaker than the flame heart blessed land. The Divine Dragon Island is no exception. Even if some of the resources in the grotto-heaven blessed land are temporarily consumed, they can still recover bit by bit.”<br/><br/>“Since the Phoenix clan is willing to return the Divine Dragon Island to us, the energy in the blessed land must have been consumed.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui said.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
