They are existences that stand above all the tribes.”<br/><br/>Beside Wang Xian and the rest, Mu Liyin’er’s father introduced them in a soft voice.<br/><br/>The two tribes stood above the intelligence quotient of all the tribes.<br/><br/>There were powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin.<br/><br/>The number of powerhouses in the tribes was also the highest.<br/><br/>When the strong disciples of the Xuan Tu tribe and the dead tribe arrived, everyone looked over as well.<br/><br/>There were more than ten million strong disciples around the entire arena.<br/><br/>The number of people in the Mu Li tribe was considered low!<br/><br/>“The disciples of each tribe should have arrived, right?”<br/><br/>At the seat of Honor, in the middle of the Black Earth tribe, an old man with a walking stick and a special hat on his head glanced at the people of the dead tribe. He swept his gaze across the surroundings and asked indifferently!<br/><br/>“Reporting to the leader, they have all arrived! ”<br/><br/>In the front, a middle-aged man bowed and reported loudly.<br/><br/>Since we have arrived, let’s begin. Many people might not recognize me. Let me introduce myself. I am the leader of the Black Earth tribe. This six paths convention is organized by the orders of the three lords and will be conducted in Earth City. ”<br/><br/>“This six paths convention is to select powerful disciples with potential for our six paths universe to groom. This competition concerns the entire six paths universe. There is no concept of a tribe. Those who can achieve success will receive treasures and resources prepared by the three lords. ”<br/><br/>“All the powerful disciples, do not hide anything. As long as you have the ability, you will be able to obtain opportunities that you can not imagine. ”<br/><br/>The leader of the Black Earth tribe spoke, his voice reaching everyone’s ears.<br/><br/>All the strong disciples of the surrounding tribes heard this, and their gazes focused.<br/><br/>Over ten million gazes landed on the old man.<br/><br/>This was the first time many strong disciples had met the leader of the Black Earth tribe.<br/><br/>They didn’t expect this person to be a peak universe overlord, the leader of the Black Earth tribe!<br/><br/>Hearing his words, many ambitious disciples revealed excited expressions.<br/><br/>If they could achieve success in this six paths convention, it could be said that they would become famous in a single battle!<br/><br/>As long as they could achieve success, they would become famous in the world.<br/><br/>Not to mention that they would have great opportunities.<br/><br/>How could they not be tempted!<br/><br/>Even Tianci’s eyes were glowing as he watched fervently.<br/><br/>“The six paths competition is divided by age. It is divided into the Wargod Group, the Heaven Roll Group, the Heaven’s Pride Group, the hidden dragon fledgling Phoenix Group. The WARGOD group can only be participated by experts at the universe ruler realm. The WARGOD Group, the Heaven Roll Group, and the Heaven’s pride group have age restrictions. The early stages of the competition are relatively simple. Each group has a thousand spots. ”<br/><br/>“After competing for the 1,000 th place, you can participate in the real competition. As long as you enter the 1,000 th place, there will be a reward. The higher the rank, the better the reward! ”<br/><br/>The leader of the Black Earth tribe continued to introduce to everyone!<br/><br/>“Alright, you guys can make the detailed arrangements. The selection has officially begun! ”<br/><br/>The leader didn’t say much, he looked to the side and disappeared!<br/><br/>“There are no rules in the quota competition, those who think they have the ability to enter the top 1,000, come out and tell us your name, age and level, those who don’t agree can challenge. ”<br/><br/>“Let’s challenge the strongest 1,000 in each group and take their spots!” A strong warrior from the Black Earth tribe continued!<br/><br/>“Tianci, go up. Join the Hidden Dragon and Young Phoenix Group at your age. Follow us and we’ll investigate. With your level of Level 5 universe knight, you’ll be able to rank in the top three! ”<br/><br/>The strong warrior from the Black Earth tribe landed and Tianci’s grandfather immediately ordered tianci!<br/><br/>Tianci’s strength was the strongest in the Mu Li tribe in the past 10 billion years.<br/><br/>Even in the entire six paths universe, he was extremely terrifying!<br/><br/>At such a young age, a level five universe knight was almost invincible among those of the same level!<br/><br/>Perhaps only the Xuan Tu tribe and the dead tribe could have a higher realm than Tianci.<br/><br/>With TIANCPs strength, he could even obtain a decent result in the Prodigy group!<br/><br/>“It’s grandfather! ”<br/><br/>Tianci nodded and looked at his mother and Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Follow your heart. You can be humble and humble, or you can show off your abilities! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at tianci and said with a smile.<br/><br/>“Foster father, this kind of situation will disappear in the future, right?” Tianci heard Wang Xian ‘s words and looked around before asking.<br/><br/>“It will disappear unless you have bad taste! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled at him and shook his head.<br/><br/>“Hehe, that’s good. From today onwards, I want the entire six paths universe to recognize me, Mu Li Tianci. I want my mother to be proud of me!”<br/><br/>Tianci raised his head and smiled at his mother. His body moved and he flew towards the arena of the Hidden Dragon and young Phoenix!<br/><br/>There were also a large number of strong people flying over from the surrounding areas.<br/><br/>Among them, there were also other disciples of the Mu Li tribe who flew towards the stages.<br/><br/>However, the one that everyone in the Mu Li tribe thought highly of was tianci.<br/><br/>Tianci landed on the stage of the Hidden Dragon and Young Phoenix. There were also people of the same age flying over from the surroundings.<br/><br/>“Mu Li tribe, Mu Li Tianci, a Level 5 universe Knight!”<br/><br/>Tianci stood on the stage and glanced at his opponent who was flying over. He smiled slightly.<br/><br/>He cupped his hands and said confidently to everyone!<br/><br/>At the bottom of the stage, Wang Xian saw Tianci standing on the stage with a confident look on his face. A smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>He had the feeling of an old father seeing his son grow up to be successful.<br/><br/>This was youth, this was youth!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
