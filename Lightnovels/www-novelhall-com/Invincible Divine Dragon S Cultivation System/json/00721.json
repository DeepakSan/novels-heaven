It was a very carefree life!<br/><br/>A year passed very quickly. Wang Xian sat on the Dragon Chair and looked at the information handed over by Prime Minister Gui!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, according to the investigations of the members of our Dragon Palace, there are basically no forces that dare to enslave and hunt people with the bloodline of the Divine Dragon in the inner and outer regions of the heaven opening desolation continent. However, outside of the heaven opening desolation continent, many forces are ignoring our orders. They all think that our dragon palace can’t interfere so far!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui stood at the bottom and reported respectfully!<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard that, he nodded his head lightly. “Get the leader of the water dragon and the rest here. Also, get them to bring all the subordinates of the Master of the universe with level three combat strength. Also, get the heaven array and Wu Sha here as well!”<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui replied immediately.<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Soon, Shui Linglong’s father, the leader of the Water Dragon, and the other leaders of the other eight attributes led their subordinates here.<br/><br/>In the current Dragon Palace, there were more than 2,000 purebred divine dragons.<br/><br/>Among them, there were more than 300 level three masters of the universe!<br/><br/>More than 2,000 purebred divine dragons belonged to the true dragon battle team of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>And these 300-odd purebred divine dragons were the top experts of the true dragon battle team!<br/><br/>They were the foundation of the future Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The foundation of the current Dragon Palace was already strong enough!<br/><br/>“Sky Formation Wizard Veil, how is the production of the dragon-seeking compass coming along?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at Sky Formation Wizard veil and the rest and asked!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, the production has been completed. Three hundred dragon-seeking compasses can cover an area of 100 billion kilometers. Anyone with the bloodline of the divine dragon will be able to sense it immediately!”<br/><br/>Wu Sha replied!<br/><br/>The current Wu Sha was much stronger than sky formation in her attainments in witchcraft!<br/><br/>Currently, Heaven’s formation and Dragon Sorcery were learning sorcery from Wu Sha!<br/><br/>Wu Sha had not evolved into a dragon sorcery. Currently, the quota for Dragon Sorcery had reached the upper limit. In the future, the Dragon Palace would not be able to give birth to a dragon sorcery!<br/><br/>Furthermore, the lineage of wizards was not weaker than the dragon sorcery. They were also the cultivation method of the peak races!<br/><br/>Among the peak races, there was no weak one.<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head, a smile appeared on his face. “Leader of the Water Dragons, take a dragon-hunting compass and patrol the heaven-splitting chaotic land and the surrounding starry skies. Once you find any forces or powerhouses that enslave the bloodline of the Divine Dragons, kill them immediately!”<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The 300 divine dragons immediately responded loudly!<br/><br/>These 300 divine dragons all possessed the combat strength of A Level 3 universe dominator!<br/><br/>This power was not weak even among the pinnacle races!<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>Soon, 240 godly dragons around the dragon palace let out roars. They swayed their huge dragon bodies and emitted huge dragon power as they flew forward!<br/><br/>240 powerful godly dragons flew in the sky. It was a spectacular sight!<br/><br/>Star City, a city that was relatively close to the river of heavenly stars!<br/><br/>The city leader of this city was a universe overlord Level 1 warrior.<br/><br/>Star City was a neutral city, and the entire city was bustling!<br/><br/>However, all of a sudden, waves of majestic dragon might were transmitted over, causing the bodies of all the warrior disciples and residents in the city to tremble slightly, and their faces were filled with fear.<br/><br/>“What a majestic aura, what’s going on?”<br/><br/>“The aura is obvious, but there’s no pressure. Over there, over there, there are powerful experts flying over!”<br/><br/>“Hiss, look, that’s… That’s a divine dragon, a powerful divine dragon. Oh My God, there are so many divine dragons!”<br/><br/>“It’s the powerful experts of the Dragon Palace, but there are… There are so many divine dragons!”<br/><br/>In the city, all the powerful disciples and residents looked towards the direction of the Milky Way!<br/><br/>They saw 240 dragons flying in the sky.<br/><br/>The huge dragons that were hundreds of thousands of meters tall gave off a powerful aura!<br/><br/>They flew over together and shocked all the residents of Heavenly Star City!<br/><br/>“240 true dragons flying. It’s been a long time since such a grand scene appeared!”<br/><br/>The city lord of Heavenly Star City flew into the sky and looked at the 240 dragons while mumbling in shock!<br/><br/>“Welcome, Lords of the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>When the 240 divine dragons flew over, the city lord of Heavenly Star City could feel the invincible power from the Divine Dragons, and he bowed respectfully!<br/><br/>“En!”<br/><br/>One of the Divine Dragons responded and flew directly towards the teleportation formation!<br/><br/>At the teleportation formation of Heavenly Star City, all the powerful disciples moved aside and looked at them in awe.<br/><br/>The 240 dragons immediately left through the teleportation array!<br/><br/>“What terrifying power! Any one of these dragons could destroy the entire Heavenly Star City!”<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace is stronger than we thought. 240 Dragons! There are so many true dragons in the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>“They should be universe Dominators with level 3 combat power. There are 240 universe Dominators with level 3 combat power. There must be a lot of true dragons in the Dragon Palace. The Glory of the Dragon Clan is about to be reappeared!”<br/><br/>All the disciples of the Great Beings in Star City were discussing!<br/><br/>At the same time, 60 divine dragons flew out from the ocean of a planet!<br/><br/>They swayed their huge bodies and flew in all directions!<br/><br/>All the creatures around trembled when they saw this terrifying power!<br/><br/>Within the Heaven Opening Primal Continent, 240 divine dragons were quickly sent to all the cities through teleportation arrays.<br/><br/>With the dragon-seeking compass, they could quickly find those with the Divine Dragon Bloodline.<br/><br/>The dragon-seeking compass was made with the dragon blood of the dragon transformation pool and the powerful array formation of the witch gauze. Even those with the Divine Dragon bloodline hidden in the divine kingdom could be found!<br/><br/>Unless the other party’s divine kingdom was very powerful.<br/><br/>But under normal circumstances, they could not avoid detection!<br/><br/>240 divine dragons were searching around the cities and races one by one. The efficiency was very high!<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>At the edge of one of the races, Lei Ming noticed the hint on the dragon-hunting compass. His eyes flickered slightly as he stared at the race in front of him with his dragon eyes!<br/><br/>The god-hunting race was a high-level race that was not weak at all!<br/><br/>Lei Ming flew into the territory of the god-hunting race.<br/><br/>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”<br/><br/>In an instant, powerful figures flew toward Lei Ming from the god-hunting race. They looked at the terrifying energy contained in Lei Ming’s body with some reverence in their eyes!<br/><br/>“May I know why this lord from the Dragon Palace has come to our God Hunter Tribe?”<br/><br/>An old man from the god Hunter tribe asked respectfully!<br/><br/>“I can sense the aura of the Yilong in your tribe. Bring that Yilong over!”<br/><br/>Lei Ming stared at them and said directly!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
