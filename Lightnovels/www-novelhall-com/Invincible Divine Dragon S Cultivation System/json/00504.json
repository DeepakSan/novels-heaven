Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face.<br/><br/>This time, his luck was better. The blood refinement fruit also attracted the pink skeleton leg with the second-level combat strength of a universe dominator, as well as a first-level combat strength desolate beast.<br/><br/>It was possible that the desolate beast was manipulated by the skeleton leg to attract Wang Xian’s attention.<br/><br/>That was not important. What was important was that they were all killed by Wang Xian!<br/><br/>The harvest was not bad!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>He took out a teleportation item and disappeared instantly.<br/><br/>The next moment, he came to a skeleton palace of the spirit demon race.<br/><br/>He sent a message to the spirit red bone. After waiting for a while, there was no reply!<br/><br/>“She should be cultivating in seclusion. The last time, she obtained three parts of the pink skeleton. Her strength should be able to rise to the level of a level three overlord of the Universe!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled.<br/><br/>“Brother from the spirit demon race, Wang Xian from the Dragon Palace wants to meet Lord Spirit Demon King!”<br/><br/>He looked at the guard of the spirit demon race and said.<br/><br/>“Yes, Lord Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>The guard of the spirit demon race recognized Wang Xian and immediately nodded. He then went to report.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>“Brother Wang Xian, Welcome!”<br/><br/>Soon, the figure of the spirit demon king appeared and said with a smile.<br/><br/>“Lord Spirit Demon King, sorry to disturb you. I was trying to contact Princess Ling Hong Gu, but I couldn’t get in touch with her, so I’m sorry to disturb you!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and moved his palm as he spoke. “I caught a pink skeleton leg in the land of blood.”<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>The spirit demon king was slightly shocked. Looking at the pink skeleton leg that contained a terrifying energy, his eyes were filled with surprise and joy.<br/><br/>“Good, good. Thank you so much, little brother Wang Xian. Now, the pink skeleton’s parts are extremely important to the red bones. The power contained in the pink skeleton leg is second only to the pink skeleton.”<br/><br/>He thanked him with some excitement.<br/><br/>The pink skeleton was the only key for the spirit red bones to advance to the level of a universe dominator. It was also the only hope for the spirit demon race to give birth to an expert at the level of a universe dominator.<br/><br/>The last time Wang Xian was able to take out two parts of the pink skeleton had already shocked them.<br/><br/>How long had it been?<br/><br/>Another one?<br/><br/>“I was lucky too. The other party ambushed me, so I suppressed them!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled.<br/><br/>“Haha, it’s her good fortune that the red skeleton was able to meet little brother Wang Xian.”<br/><br/>The Spirit Demon King laughed out loud. With a wave of his arm, a pitch-black skeleton mask floated in front of him. “Little brother Wang Xian, this pink skeleton leg is very important to the red skeleton. We have nothing to repay it with. Please accept this treasure!”<br/><br/>“This innate spiritual treasure is called the skull cross nail. There was once a fallen angel who used this skull cross nail to kill an Archangel of light. It has a great restraint against light. Since you have a grudge with the holy dragon lineage, perhaps this can be used.”<br/><br/>As he spoke, the skull cross mask, although it was a mask, was called the skull cross nail. It was stained with the blood of an Archangel.<br/><br/>An Archangel was a powerful existence at the level of the ruler of the universe.<br/><br/>The skull cross nail was suspended on Wang Xian’s body. He could feel the terrifying energy contained within.<br/><br/>This was not an ordinary innate treasure!<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s gaze focused slightly as he looked at the spirit demon king. “Lord Spirit Demon King, this is too precious!”<br/><br/>“Haha, compared to this pink skull leg, this is nothing.”<br/><br/>The Spirit Demon King shook his head.<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and didn’t say anything. He stretched out his hand and held the skeleton cross mask in his hand.<br/><br/>He could feel that the light energy in his body was being suppressed by an extremely strong force.<br/><br/>As expected of an innate spiritual treasure that was stained with the blood of an Archangel. It was far from being comparable to an ordinary innate spiritual treasure.<br/><br/>Wang Xian estimated that this innate spiritual treasure was not weaker than the light spear that the holy dragon lineage used to sneak attack him.<br/><br/>The Light Spear had broken his tai chi dragon disk in an instant.<br/><br/>“Thank you, Lord Spirit Demon King.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. He hesitated for a moment before a fruit appeared in his hand.<br/><br/>The fruit was the soul-returning embryo fruit. It was a heaven-defying fruit that could revive people.<br/><br/>This was also considered the strongest fruit in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“This is for Princess Ling Honggu. Lord Spirit Demon King, we will meet again if we have the chance!”<br/><br/>He cupped his hands and his figure began to turn illusory.<br/><br/>Spirit Demon King was slightly stunned. His expression changed slightly when he saw the fruit floating in the air.<br/><br/>He moved his hand and held it in his hand, feeling the energy within.<br/><br/>In the next moment, his eyes shone with shock.<br/><br/>“Resurrection Fruit!”<br/><br/>Spirit demon king was filled with shock. “It’s actually such a precious fruit. He actually took it out and gave it to red bone. Could it be that he has taken a fancy to Red Bone?”<br/><br/>The Spirit Demon King could not help but guess. After all, this fruit was too precious.<br/><br/>It was so precious that the entire spirit demon race did not have such a powerful fruit.<br/><br/>Treasures related to resurrection were all extremely rare.<br/><br/>It was extremely precious, and it did not allow the spirit demon king to not make wild guesses.<br/><br/>“Hehe, this Wang Xian is not bad. If the news is true, he is the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. In the future, he might be able to step into the realm of the ruler of the Universe!”<br/><br/>The spirit demon king smiled and kept the fruit. Then, his figure moved and returned to his divine kingdom.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, his daughter was undergoing a fusion and breakthrough in her divine kingdom!<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not know what the Spirit Demon King was thinking. If he knew, he would definitely vomit blood.<br/><br/>He was only giving the soul-returning embryo fruit in return for a favor!<br/><br/>Since the spirit demon race was a good friend, Wang Xian was not in a bad position either!<br/><br/>As for the soul-returning embryo fruit?<br/><br/>There were many such fruits in the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>If it weren’t for the fact that he was afraid of wantonly attacking and attracting the attention of other factions, Wang Xian would have wanted to sell a few hundred of them. He would have directly reached the level four or even level five combat strength of a universe overlord.<br/><br/>It was a pity that it was best not to reveal such a treasure. Otherwise, there was no guarantee that the experts from the peak races wouldn’t covet it.<br/><br/>A fruit of such a level was comparable to the fruit of life of the elf race!<br/><br/>Wang Xian returned to his divine kingdom. His body moved and he immediately arrived at the grotto-heaven blessed land under the water in the sky!<br/><br/>After leaving the grotto-heaven blessed land, he immediately flew towards the agreed place with the Azure Dragon Moon.<br/><br/>At this moment, the strange cross-shaped skull mask on his face was emitting a terrifying aura.<br/><br/>However, his body was exuding a wood attribute energy, making him seem a little strange.<br/><br/>The agreed location with the Green Dragon Moon was at the edge of a forest. He flew for more than ten days before arriving at his destination.<br/><br/>He scanned his surroundings and realized that there was no trace of the Green Dragon Moon. His universal AI sent a message.<br/><br/>“Dragon King? Brother Wang Xian?”<br/><br/>In the next moment, Green Dragon Moon’s figure appeared in a tree. He shouted at Wang Xian’s figure in puzzlement.<br/><br/>He was a little unsure.<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian’s aura was completely different from what he knew.<br/><br/>“Brother Green Dragon Moon!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at him and revealed a smile. The mask on his face slowly disappeared.<br/><br/>“It’s really the Dragon King. I don’t dare to recognize your aura!”<br/><br/>A smile appeared on Qing Longyue’s face as she flew over immediately.<br/><br/>“Just Call Me Wang Xian. You Don’t have to be so unfamiliar with me!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled. When he saw her flying over, he patted her on the shoulder!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
