To be able to control the crescent moon illumination to detect, he had yet to reach the level of being extremely stealthy.<br/><br/>The nine swords and Dragon descendants had powerful anti-detection treasures.<br/><br/>However, they did not escape immediately. Instead, they flew out and waited quietly.<br/><br/>Three Universe Knights of the nine swords race, more than ten peak-stage divine emperor powerhouses, and the treasures of their race.<br/><br/>“Oh?”<br/><br/>“We found them!”<br/><br/>At this moment, an image appeared in front of Wang Xian and the others in the volcano region.<br/><br/>In the image, the nine swords race people were floating quietly at the bottom of the sea, squinting their eyes.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, they have sensed us. Are they arrogant? They didn’t escape.”<br/><br/>A cold look appeared in the eyes of the Heaven Array as he spoke.<br/><br/>“The two races didn’t attack us directly. They probably don’t understand our background and have some misgivings. Therefore, they used this method to test our strength.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said coldly.<br/><br/>“It seems like they are confident that we can’t leave all of them here.”<br/><br/>Ba Qi said with murderous intent.<br/><br/>“Then we shall keep all of them here today. Not a single one of them!”<br/><br/>Mo Sha and the rest said coldly from the side.<br/><br/>“Wait, I guess the nine-sword race should have joined forces with the dragon-descendant race. Perhaps the dragon-descendant race will join up with them soon.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them expressionlessly.<br/><br/>Tian Cheng and the rest nodded their heads.<br/><br/>“I’ll set up a formation around here and set up a huge net.”<br/><br/>Tian Chen moved and flew forward quickly. He began to set up formation after formation.<br/><br/>These formations were to prevent the Universe Knights of the nine swords race and the dragon race from escaping.<br/><br/>Now, every member of the Dragon Palace had a violent killing intent in their hearts. They swore to kill all of them.<br/><br/>The rest of the members of the Dragon Palace quietly looked at the nine blades on the screen.<br/><br/>Time passed by slowly.<br/><br/>“Eh? The Dragon Palace has clearly detected us, why aren’t they here yet?”<br/><br/>At the same time, at the bottom of the Milky Way, the knight at the center of the nine blades saw that there was no movement ahead, and he slightly raised his eyebrows.<br/><br/>“There is one possibility, and that is that the Dragon Palace feels that they are no match for us.”<br/><br/>The old man on the right, who was holding a huge sword, smiled faintly and said.<br/><br/>“It is possible. According to the information we have received, other than him obtaining the treasure of Crescent Moon Knight, there is only the battle record of killing a new knight. That New Knight was caught off guard and was killed completely carelessly. I really do not believe that the Dragon Palace is too powerful.”<br/><br/>“At most, there are some battle angels in the Crescent Moon Mystic Realm.”<br/><br/>The old man on the left said indifferently.<br/><br/>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”<br/><br/>Just as they were talking, figures flew over from the rear.<br/><br/>“Venerable Xingjian, is the Dragon Palace watching you?”<br/><br/>The leader of the Dragon Race, a venerable, glanced at them and asked.<br/><br/>“Yes, we’ve detected that someone is watching us. It should be the Dragon Palace, but they haven’t come over.”<br/><br/>The nine-sword race’s leader, the Venerable Star Sword, replied with a smile on his face.<br/><br/>“They haven’t come over? Then if we come over, wouldn’t they be even more afraid to come over?”<br/><br/>The Venerable at the center of the Dragon race was slightly taken aback as he spoke.<br/><br/>“I think that our two races can discuss the matter of attacking the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Venerate Xingjian said faintly.<br/><br/>“I think it’s fine.”<br/><br/>The elder at the center of the dragon race nodded. “Now, the other sub-dragons in the AI should also know the danger here and won’t come over.”<br/><br/>“Let’s go back and discuss the matter of destroying the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>The venerate of the dragon race and the nine swords race decided.<br/><br/>“Haha, Useless Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>At the back, a seemingly unruly old man raised his middle finger and sneered at the position above.<br/><br/>They knew that in the detection of the Dragon Palace, he opened his mouth wide and could see what he said at a glance.<br/><br/>“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!”<br/><br/>However, at this moment, a terrifying aura came at them.<br/><br/>The entire Milky Way’s seabed started to change, and an unfamiliar world seemed to be invading.<br/><br/>The world underwent a huge change.<br/><br/>“Mn?”<br/><br/>The expressions of nine swords, dragon descendant, and the others who were conversing changed, and they immediately looked ahead.<br/><br/>“Hong Long Long!”<br/><br/>However, at this moment, a towering dragon palace was floating above them.<br/><br/>Even though the Dragon Palace couldn’t withstand an attack from a universe knight, one had to know that there were dragon lairs within the sky array.<br/><br/>Their dragon lairs were equivalent to their own universe God Country, and they contained vast power.<br/><br/>It could be said that summoning the dragon palace was Wang Xian’s strongest attack.<br/><br/>The strength of the sky array and the rest could also reach their strongest.<br/><br/>This time, Wang Xian used all his strength to deal with the six universe knights of the nine-sword race and the dragon-descendant race.<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>All the Universe Knights of the Dragon Palace appeared from the front, back, left, and right.<br/><br/>Their faces were filled with cold killing intent as they locked onto everyone from the nine swords race and the dragon-descendant race.<br/><br/>“I swear, I will make all of you suffer so much that you wish you were dead.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at everyone from the nine swords race and the dragon-descendant race and said calmly.<br/><br/>“Keke, how dare you say that I will torture you for ten years in our Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>Mo Sha stared at the elder who was cursing the Dragon Palace and said coldly.<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>The six venerables from the nine swords race and the dragon-descendant race sensed the terrifying aura around them and looked at the more than twenty venerables from the Dragon Palace who were floating around them. Their expressions changed drastically.<br/><br/>“How is this possible? Why are there so many venerables in Your Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>Venerable Xingjian’s heart tightened as cold sweat broke out on his face. His gaze landed on Wang Xian as his expression changed drastically.<br/><br/>“Dead people don’t need to know!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved his body and didn’t give them any time to react. He flapped his incipient saint wings and attacked them instantly.<br/><br/>“Kill! If I let you escape today, I will cut off your heads!”<br/><br/>Eight points roared and attacked them.<br/><br/>In an instant, the seawater at the bottom of the Milky Way evaporated.<br/><br/>Roar! Roar<br/><br/>Nine godly dragons descended from the Dragon Palace in the sky, each with nine attributes.<br/><br/>The appearance of the Dragon Palace also meant that sky array, eight points, and the others had summoned their God countries.<br/><br/>The battle to summon their God countries was usually a fight to the death.<br/><br/>“Not good, they have over 20 knights and Universe Knight Level 2 beings, flee!”<br/><br/>A Knight of the Dragon Race roared with a terrifying expression.<br/><br/>At this moment, the old man who had just said that the Dragon Palace was trash had an extremely pale face and was trembling.<br/><br/>They couldn’t participate in a knight level battle at all.<br/><br/>One beam of energy was enough to crush him.<br/><br/>In particular, he found out in despair that a dragon palace venerable had locked onto him.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
