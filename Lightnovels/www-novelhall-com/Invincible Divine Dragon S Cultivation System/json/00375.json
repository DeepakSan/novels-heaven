I hope I can pass the assessment this time!”<br/><br/>“The minimum strength requirement was at the fourth level void God Emperor last time. I wonder what the minimum strength requirement is this time?”<br/><br/>“This doesn’t just depend on the minimum strength. It also depends on your bloodline and physique. Those who can’t fight two levels above you will probably be eliminated!”<br/><br/>Ten days later, Wang Xian arrived at the selection venue of the Thunder Ray race’s disciples. At this moment, a large number of people had gathered around.<br/><br/>Some young men walked towards the huge venue in front of them. There were more than ten million people in the entire square.<br/><br/>In the surroundings, there were various spaceships or experts floating on treasures, waiting for their children’s test in anticipation.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the arena and at a stone at the entrance.<br/><br/>There were rings of growth rings on that stone. It looked very mystical.<br/><br/>“You are over twenty epochs old. Get Out Now!”<br/><br/>At this moment, he saw a young man walking in. However, when he passed by the stone, the growth rings on the stone were glowing.<br/><br/>A middle-aged man sitting by the side locked his gaze on the young man and coldly warned him.<br/><br/>“Sir, I was only in closed-door cultivation and missed the last disciple recruitment. My strength is strong enough!”<br/><br/>The young man’s expression changed drastically and he immediately explained.<br/><br/>“Get out. If you are older than your age and want to join My Thunder Ray race, you will have to go to the Thunder Cloud to pass the trial.”<br/><br/>“This…”<br/><br/>This caused the young man’s expression to change drastically. When he saw that many people were staring at him, he left dejectedly.<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze across the crowd and walked straight in.<br/><br/>The recruitment of disciples by any tribe did not require all the strong ones.<br/><br/>Compared to the strong ones, they valued loyalty and potential more.<br/><br/>This was also to prevent other factions from infiltrating their tribe.<br/><br/>By recruiting younger disciples, they could cultivate loyalty and pass all sorts of tests to test their loyalty.<br/><br/>However, for some older ones who suddenly appeared to join their race, they would basically not agree.<br/><br/>Even if they agreed, they would not place them in an important position.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian entered, the stone with the growth rings did not show any reaction. Clearly, he had passed the test.<br/><br/>He scanned the surroundings and revealed a smile on his face.<br/><br/>With a glance, he saw the strongest level eight void God Emperor.<br/><br/>In fact, to be able to reach level eight void God emperor after cultivating for less than two million years was already very impressive.<br/><br/>This required one to have a strong bloodline, or a strong physique, as well as a strong inheritance.<br/><br/>If these people were placed on the side of Lu Xing Kong, they would all be rare geniuses that had been around for billions of years.<br/><br/>However, this place was different from the side of Lu Xingkong. Any random person from this side would be able to fight against those of a higher level.<br/><br/>There were also many people who fought against those who were two levels higher.<br/><br/>Even those who fought against those who were three levels higher were not that rare.<br/><br/>After all, this was the center of the universe, the center of the heaven splitting chaotic land.<br/><br/>Many disciples from the various peak races were able to fight against those who were three levels higher.<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood in the middle of the square and waited quietly.<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>Not long after, more than a dozen figures appeared in a teleportation formation in front of the square.<br/><br/>These figures had a pair of wings on their backs. Their noses were a little sharp and their bodies were about two meters tall.<br/><br/>The arrival of more than a dozen experts from the lightning race shocked the entire square.<br/><br/>“The assessment is about to begin. This time, there is no minimum limit to one’s strength. All aspects of the assessment include potential, comprehension of the lightning attribute, and strength!”<br/><br/>The middle-aged man in the center looked down sharply at all the disciples participating in the assessment and said directly.<br/><br/>“This is a chance for us!”<br/><br/>“We must succeed!”<br/><br/>Some of the participants had looks of joy on their faces as they clenched their fists tightly.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>At the next moment, the leader of the Lightning race waved his arm. A Thundercloud appeared in the sky and enveloped everyone.<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his head. His eyes were sparkling.<br/><br/>This was an acquired treasure.<br/><br/>“Let the assessment begin.”<br/><br/>As the leader of the middle-aged men finished his sentence, bolts of lightning descended from the sky.<br/><br/>A bolt of lightning landed on Wang Xian’s body, but there was no reaction from him at all.<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>However, screams of pain rang out continuously in the surroundings.<br/><br/>One by one, the young men who screamed and fell to the ground were directly sent out with a wave of the arm of the Lightning Race’s powerhouse.<br/><br/>“Crackle crackle!”<br/><br/>Five seconds later, another bolt of lightning landed on Wang Xian’s body. The power of this little bit of lightning was about the same as his scraping.<br/><br/>However, this time, another batch of people fell.<br/><br/>The third round continued until the fifth round. There were only about a thousand people in the arena.<br/><br/>At this moment, apart from Wang Xian, everyone else was in a sorry state.<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood there without changing his expression. He attracted the attention of the experts from the Lightning race ahead. They were astonished.<br/><br/>Around them, some of the examinees were also looking at Wang Xian in shock.<br/><br/>“Good, not bad. The 1,103 of you have passed the test. You can join the outer sect of our lightning race. Follow us now. There are also some simple tests.”<br/><br/>More than a dozen experts from the lightning race looked satisfied as they spoke to them.<br/><br/>“Follow us into the teleportation formation!”<br/><br/>More than a dozen experts of the Lightning race immediately entered the teleportation formation and disappeared.<br/><br/>“Let’s go, Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>More than a thousand disciples who passed the assessment followed behind with excited faces as they teleported through the teleportation formation.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>When Wang Xian entered the teleportation formation, he immediately felt the surroundings changing.<br/><br/>The power in front of him was a palace. The entire palace was suspended in a thundercloud.<br/><br/>They were on a high platform in front of the palace.<br/><br/>There were quite a number of disciples from the Lightning race in the surroundings. There were tens of thousands of them.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian arrived here, a strong attractive force was felt.<br/><br/>His eyes flashed with a hint of heat. He immediately looked towards the front.<br/><br/>In the middle of the front, an elder from the lightning race was sitting there.<br/><br/>That familiar feeling came from the position of the old man’s wings.<br/><br/>Lei Yu was there.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
