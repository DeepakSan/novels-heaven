It was only a few billion kilometers in size.<br/><br/>There were over 10,000 purple thunder snakes in the lake.<br/><br/>Most of them were not weaker than a level 3 or 4 universe knight.<br/><br/>This was a powerful race of desolate beasts.<br/><br/>And that purple lightning snake was the king of the Purple Lightning Snake Race!<br/><br/>“The lair of the purple lightning snake is right here. This time, I want to see where you can escape to!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression. He moved his body and flew directly towards the sky above the Lightning Lake.<br/><br/>He came to an extremely high position and avoided the detection of all the purple lightning snakes. With a move of his palm, the five elements millstone appeared above him.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>In the next moment, the entire five elements millstone expanded crazily, covering an area of billions of kilometers.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian transformed into his divine dragon form and brought the five elements millstone down.<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>Waves of extremely terrifying energy charged towards the Lightning Lake.<br/><br/>At this moment, all the purple lightning snakes in the lake trembled as they looked at the sky in horror.<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>They let out terrified cries.<br/><br/>“Hiss Hiss Hiss!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the single-horned purple thundersnake king emerged from the hole in the lake.<br/><br/>When it saw the figure of Wang Xian in the sky, its eyes were filled with shock and fury.<br/><br/>Why did this creature chase after it?<br/><br/>Did It return to its nest in an instant?<br/><br/>How did the other party know the location of its nest?<br/><br/>Sensing the five elements millstone and the might coming from Wang Xian, it was a little anxious.<br/><br/>“The shadow of the Holy Dragon!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian let out a low growl and attacked downwards.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>When the purple lightning snake saw Wang Xian attacking it directly, it raised its head. The Lightning Horn on its head released a terrifying lightning force and charged upwards.<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>A terrifying collision sound rang out. However, at this moment, the five elements grinding mill above them started to form a long river of destruction that swept downwards.<br/><br/>“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”<br/><br/>“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”<br/><br/>The other weak purple lightning snakes roared in horror. Faced with the attacks of Wang Xian and their snake king, they were completely unable to withstand the terrifying aftershocks!<br/><br/>In an instant, a large number of purple lightning snakes died.<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>The purple lightning snake king sensed this scene and revealed a furious look in his eyes.<br/><br/>His body stirred and the surrounding lightning lake water rose up. It condensed into the shape of his body and attacked towards the river of annihilation.<br/><br/>During his attack, a large number of purple lightning snakes were affected and died instantly.<br/><br/>However, at this moment, the Purple Lightning Snake King no longer cared about so much.<br/><br/>The reason why desolate beasts were desolate beasts was that they only had instincts. They could only hunt, eat, and fight.<br/><br/>They did not have much intelligence.<br/><br/>“Hehe, I’ll Kill You Today, You Beast!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s face turned cold when he saw its attack.<br/><br/>With the five elements grindstone, he was 100% confident that he could kill an expert at the peak of the Universe Knight Realm.<br/><br/>Even if the opponent had an innate spiritual treasure.<br/><br/>“Towering Dragon Horn!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian growled. A nine-colored light condensed on the dragon horn and charged downwards.<br/><br/>The Purple Thunder Snake King’s attack only broke through the five elements Grindstone’s River of obliteration. The nine-colored towering dragon horn instantly landed on the head of the Purple Thunder Snake King!<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>The Purple Lightning Snake King let out a low roar. His eyes were filled with fear.<br/><br/>He raised his head and the Lightning Horn went straight for it.<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>A terrifying collision sounded. A large amount of blood oozed out from his head.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian had already arrived beside him. He clawed at him with his dragon claws.<br/><br/>“Whoosh!”<br/><br/>The Purple Lightning Snake King shook his huge body hurriedly and threw it at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his dragon tail and collided with it.<br/><br/>“Bang, Bang, Bang!”<br/><br/>The moment it attacked, the five elements grinding attacks landed on its body.<br/><br/>A large amount of blood splattered from its body and various wounds appeared.<br/><br/>“Hiss, hiss, hiss!”<br/><br/>The Purple Lightning Snake King’s eyes were filled with fear. It shook its huge body and wanted to escape.<br/><br/>It knew that it was definitely not a match for Wang Xian.<br/><br/>In fact, it would be killed soon.<br/><br/>However, it was overthinking if it wanted to escape.<br/><br/>Splash<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s figure flashed and appeared in front of the Purple Lightning Snake King in an instant. He opened his mouth and spewed out all kinds of energy currents!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>The five elements grinding mill also released a series of attacks that completely covered the purple lightning snake king.<br/><br/>“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”<br/><br/>The purple lightning snake king sensed the terrifying attacks around it. Its body trembled and was covered by lightning. The surrounding lake water surged towards it to protect its body.<br/><br/>“Bang! Bang! Bang!”<br/><br/>However, the powerful attacks still broke through its defense, causing a large number of wounds to appear on its body.<br/><br/>“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”<br/><br/>The Purple Lightning Snake King cried out. Its cold eyes were filled with fear. It curled up and cried out to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“HMM? Is this a surrender? aren’t there many desolate beasts that surrender?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw the purple lightning snake king shouting non-stop.<br/><br/>Desolate beasts were more ferocious than their rationality. They would not beg for mercy even if they died in battle.<br/><br/>However, it was obvious that this purple lightning snake king wanted to live.<br/><br/>It was rare, but it was not that strange.<br/><br/>Firstly, Wang Xian was much stronger than it. The power of the Divine Dragon coupled with his powerful strength completely suppressed it and made it submit.<br/><br/>Secondly, the Purple Thunder Snake King possessed an innate spiritual treasure.<br/><br/>The innate spiritual treasure had a spirit and could open its intelligence. Under the influence of the innate spiritual treasure, it might have gained some rationality.<br/><br/>“Submit?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he stared at the Purple Thunder Snake King. There was a look of hesitation on his face.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, Wang Xian didn’t care too much about its submission.<br/><br/>After killing it, the heaven array could be upgraded to the peak of a universe knight. With his strength, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to fight against three of them alone.<br/><br/>It might be difficult for the Purple Thunder Snake King to fight against two of them alone.<br/><br/>This was under the condition of relying on the innate spiritual treasure.<br/><br/>“Hiss, hiss, hiss!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the purple thunder snake in front of him lowered its head and kept swallowing and spitting.<br/><br/>“Forget it, subdue it, be a mount!”<br/><br/>He thought about it and decided in his heart.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
