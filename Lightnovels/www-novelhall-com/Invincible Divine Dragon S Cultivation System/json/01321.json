He entered the restaurant for no reason and ordered a table full of delicacies to taste one by one.<br/><br/>Soon, plates of delicacies were served.<br/><br/>The delicacies from other universes were indeed unique.<br/><br/>The business of fantasy restaurant was also very good. It was always full of people.<br/><br/>Wang Xian ate the delicacies while sizing up his surroundings.<br/><br/>The customers around him were all masters in the mastery realm.<br/><br/>He even saw a master who had just entered the Heaven’s origin realm. He was hiding his aura and drinking there!<br/><br/>Wang Xian took a glance at the elder who had just entered the Heaven’s origin realm. A smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>The elder sensed Wang Xian’s gaze and swept his gaze over.<br/><br/>However, he did not notice anything unusual.<br/><br/>He did not pay much attention to a disciple with the fire attribute who was at the peak of the Dominator realm.<br/><br/>“Such a situation is really dazzling!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself.<br/><br/>There were as many disciples at the Dominator realm as dogs. It was common to meet strong people at the Heaven’s origin level.<br/><br/>They would even hide among the ordinary disciples and play with their lives.<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>At this moment, a few young men and women with sharp swords walked into the restaurant.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s gaze swept across them and landed on the young men and women. He felt a familiar aura.<br/><br/>“There’s an aura of the Heaven’s origin sword technique.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at these young men and women and muttered.<br/><br/>The Heaven’s origin sword technique was a powerful sword technique that Wang Xian had obtained by accident.<br/><br/>It was a sword technique that could lead straight to the Heaven’s origin realm.<br/><br/>And this sword technique originated from the sword universe.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was not familiar with the sword universe. In fact, he only understood it from the Heaven’s origin sword technique.<br/><br/>But now, he could actually feel a familiar aura.<br/><br/>This Is?<br/><br/>A disciple of the universe of Swords?<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>When he landed on the body of a woman in the middle, he raised his eyebrows slightly.<br/><br/>It was a little strange.<br/><br/>The woman was a sword cultivator with the darkness attribute. Her strength was at the eighth level of the ruler of the universe.<br/><br/>This was not what surprised Wang Xian.<br/><br/>What surprised him was that there seemed to be something in his body.<br/><br/>This thing contained an extremely powerful energy.<br/><br/>However, this thing was well hidden. If it wasn’t for the chaotic energy in Wang Xian’s body, he wouldn’t have been able to sense it.<br/><br/>“Not simple. It can actually block my detection.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed for a moment but didn’t discover what this thing was. A look of astonishment appeared on his face.<br/><br/>One had to know that he was only a few dozen meters away from the lady. At such a close distance, he was actually unable to see through anything.<br/><br/>One could imagine that this thing was not simple.<br/><br/>It was at least an existence at the Heaven’s origin level.<br/><br/>“It’s a living thing!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued to think to himself.<br/><br/>Many guesses appeared in his mind.<br/><br/>“My Friend, you don’t have anyone here, right?”<br/><br/>At this moment, coincidentally, a few young men and women glanced around and came to Wang Xian’s side. They spoke to him.<br/><br/>“Sure!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them and nodded with a smile.<br/><br/>The six of them smiled and sat at the side.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw the woman approaching, he sensed her silently once again.<br/><br/>He looked at the woman and hesitated for a moment. Then, he said directly, “My friend, you have something dirty on you.”<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>When the young men and women who had just sat down heard Wang Xian’s sudden words, they were stunned.<br/><br/>Jian Tian Yao, in particular, looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.<br/><br/>She sized up Wang Xian?<br/><br/>What was going on?<br/><br/>Was he trying to hit on her?<br/><br/>“Friend, what business do you have?”<br/><br/>Beside Jian Tian Yao, a young man frowned as he looked at Wang Xian and asked.<br/><br/>“I can feel an energy that doesn’t belong to me from her body. It’s very special.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke and looked at Jian tianyao. “Can I sense it?”<br/><br/>“How can there be any energy that doesn’t belong to me? Are you mistaken?”<br/><br/>Jian Tianyao looked at Wang Xian in astonishment and frowned as well.<br/><br/>“I’m stronger than you, so I can sense it. Let me check it out.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued to speak to her.<br/><br/>Jian Tian Yao looked at Wang Xian and then at her companions.<br/><br/>“What do you want to see?”<br/><br/>Her senior brother beside her felt a sense of wariness as he looked at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Just use your energy to check it out!”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, a wisp of flame floated in front of Jian Tian Yao!<br/><br/>“Even my seniors didn’t sense anything special in my body. How can you sense it?”<br/><br/>Jian Tianyao didn’t believe this man who said that there was something strange in her body when they first met. She continued to ask cautiously.<br/><br/>“I have a special feeling. I just need to touch it and I will know.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at her and continued.<br/><br/>He was prepared to make a move if this woman didn’t agree to it.<br/><br/>With his strength, she wouldn’t be able to sense him even if he made a move.<br/><br/>“I want to see what you are up to.”<br/><br/>Jian tianyao stared at the Wisp of flame in front of her and said!<br/><br/>“Don’t worry, I have no ill intentions!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at him with a smile on his face. A wisp of flame landed on her body.<br/><br/>At this moment, the power of the flame entered Jian Tianyao’s body instantly.<br/><br/>Before she could react, Wang Xian had already sensed the energy in the ball.<br/><br/>“This is?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s face revealed a hint of surprise.<br/><br/>When his energy sensed the special thing in the woman’s body, he was a little shocked.<br/><br/>There was actually an existence at the level of Tianyuan creation in her body.<br/><br/>No, it couldn’t be said to be a powerhouse at the level of Tianyuan creation.<br/><br/>It was more like an existence at the level of Tianyuan creation was being nurtured in his body.<br/><br/>It was slightly different from the birth of Tianci by Tianci’s mother.<br/><br/>The Heaven’s origin creation in the woman’s body was a living being and not a treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation.<br/><br/>However, this living being was currently in a state of deep sleep and was extremely weak.<br/><br/>It had completely fused with the woman and was absorbing energy to revive.<br/><br/>“Possession? Or what is the situation?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes were shining.<br/><br/>He wanted to capture it, but he realized that he could not capture it at all. It was as if he had completely fused with the woman.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s mind moved and mobilized the chaotic energy in his body.<br/><br/>That Thing was located in the woman’s body. It was as if Wang Xian had fused with the primal chaos stone.<br/><br/>It was extremely strange.<br/><br/>However, when Wang Xian mobilized that weak chaotic energy, he was able to capture that heaven origin blessed embryo.<br/><br/>His gaze focused.<br/><br/>Following that, on Jian Tian Yao’s body, a palm-sized, baby-like object was pulled out by Wang Xian.<br/><br/>When Jian Tian Yao saw an object coming out of her body, her face revealed a look of shock.<br/><br/>The faces of the few companions beside her changed slightly as well. They stood up immediately and stared at the strange embryo and Wang Xian vigilantly.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
