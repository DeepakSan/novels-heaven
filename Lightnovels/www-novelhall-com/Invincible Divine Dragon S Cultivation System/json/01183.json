After all, Tianci has yet to reach the destiny realm of the Tianyuan universe. There are also experts from other universes coveting the Supreme Treasure in his body. The nine-origin universe is very strong, and experts from other universes do not dare to enter. ”<br/><br/>“It’s also a good choice for Tianci to go back with you, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The dead spirit, golden leopard, earth sand city, and the rest looked at each other and spoke to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>They understood everything in their hearts.<br/><br/>This Dragon King was worried about letting them watch Tianci.<br/><br/>After all, the attraction of a Heaven’s origin destiny treasure was too great!<br/><br/>They could understand why he wanted to take it away.<br/><br/>Most importantly, Tianci was a disciple of their six paths universe after all. He had to return to the six paths universe to live.<br/><br/>They were not worried that tianci would not return in the future.<br/><br/>Moreover, Tianci’s tribe and family were all in the six paths universe. Tianci was still a member of their six paths universe, now and in the future.<br/><br/>“Tianci, go with the Dragon King to another universe and cultivate in peace. We will take good care of your family and your tribe. ”<br/><br/>Tusha city said to tianci!<br/><br/>“Thank you, Lord Tusha City! ”<br/><br/>Tianci heard this and thanked him with a smile.<br/><br/>“Hehe, I don’t dare. Tianci, your strength will definitely surpass mine in the future. I still need you to take care of me in the future! ”<br/><br/>Tulsa city quickly said!<br/><br/>He also understood that Mu Li Tianci had a heavenly fate treasure. As long as he broke through to the heavenly fate realm, his strength would definitely be stronger than his.<br/><br/>It would be good for the future to build a good relationship with him now!<br/><br/>“Tianci will be stronger than us in the future. I wonder what kind of ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin realm tianci has?” Jin Bao looked at Wang Xian and asked curiously.<br/><br/>“Wood attribute, attack Type! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to him.<br/><br/>“Attack type. When Tianci stepped into the Heaven’s origin realm, he should be able to match the control level. I, Jin Bao, also admire the Dragon King. He is not moved by such an ultimate treasure. It is really admirable!”<br/><br/>Jin Bao sighed slightly and cupped his hands at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>As the precious treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation, they all knew that as long as they killed tianci, they would be able to easily snatch away the precious treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether it was for their own use or to nurture their own disciples, it would bring them immeasurable benefits.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was still very shocked to be able to give up.<br/><br/>He wasn’t the only one. All the powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin realm were very surprised by this.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard his praise, he smiled faintly.<br/><br/>The group chatted for a while before they came to a palace at the side!<br/><br/>This palace was called the Heavenly Dragon Palace. It was a majestic palace that was personally built in earth city by Sand City.<br/><br/>The size and glory of the palace was the highest in the entire Earth City!<br/><br/>It was heaven’s Gift!<br/><br/>A dragon was naturally the Dragon King’s Dragon!<br/><br/>This was also Earth City’s way of fawning over Heaven’s Gift!<br/><br/>The six paths competition was also suspended because of Heaven’s gift.<br/><br/>And this matter was also spread to every corner of the six paths universe at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>Heavenly Yuan Destiny Treasure Youth.<br/><br/>Mu Litianci, who was born extraordinary.<br/><br/>Mu Litianci, who would definitely step into the Heavenly Yuan Destiny Realm in the future.<br/><br/>And Mu Li Tianci’s foster father, the nine origin universe Dragon Palace Dragon King!<br/><br/>All sorts of legends and discussions spread throughout the entire six paths universe.<br/><br/>Especially when the powerful disciples of the Mu Li tribe heard this news, they were all dumbfounded and filled with shock.<br/><br/>Who would have thought that a true dragon son of heaven would appear in their small Mu Li tribe!<br/><br/>A true dragon son of heaven!<br/><br/>The strong disciples of their Mu Li tribe were quickly invited to Earth city by the experts of the Black Earth tribe and the dead tribe.<br/><br/>Even the leader of the tribe was in a daze when he heard this news!<br/><br/>The Mu Li tribe had truly soared into the sky this time because of tianci!<br/><br/>The Nine River Tribe had also soared into the sky together with the Mu Li tribe!<br/><br/>The Nine River Tribe was only able to do so because of Gong Cheng’s aim.<br/><br/>Mu Li Tianci and Gong Cheng’s aim was a matter of a couple, but it made the experts of the Nine River tribe excited for a long time.<br/><br/>Especially when they learned that Mu Li Tianci had already brought Gong Cheng aim to meet that Dragon King and obtained his approval!<br/><br/>Their Nine River Tribe was a true aristocratic family of the Empress!<br/><br/>The tribe of the future wife of a heavenly yuan creator.<br/><br/>Who Dared to provoke them?<br/><br/>Even the Black Earth tribe and the dead tribe didn’t dare!<br/><br/>The Black Earth tribe’s dead tribe had two lords, the Sand City and the dead.<br/><br/>But their nine river tribe didn’t only have mu litianci, they also had Mu Litianci’s foster father, the extremely powerful Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>Everyone in the six paths universe knew how powerful the Dragon King was.<br/><br/>In the following period of time, the six paths conference continued!<br/><br/>After the six paths conference had selected all the strongest people, a grand banquet was held.<br/><br/>The main purpose of the banquet was to celebrate Mu Litianci!<br/><br/>It was to celebrate the fact that their six paths universe would be able to increase the number of powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin realm in the future.<br/><br/>The entire banquet lasted for a year!<br/><br/>And when the banquet ended, it had been more than 10,000 years since the last GREAT WAR!<br/><br/>During these 10,000 years, Wang Xian had tianci accompany his family and girlfriend!<br/><br/>“Tianci, cultivate well and strive to reach the Tianyuan blessed realm as soon as possible. I still need you to protect the six paths universe in the future. ” After the banquet, they were in a large hall.<br/><br/>Tusha city and the rest spoke to Mu Li Tianci who was in front of them!<br/><br/>“Okay, Goodbye, uncles. I’ll be back as soon as possible.”<br/><br/>Tianci nodded at them.<br/><br/>“Yin ‘er, take good care of Tianci! ”<br/><br/>The leader of the Mu Li tribe spoke to Mu Li Yin ‘er and the rest!<br/><br/>This time, it wasn’t just Tianci who followed Wang Xian to the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>Tianci’s mother, grandfather, and more than a dozen family members also followed.<br/><br/>Even Gong Chengmu, his father, and some of his family members followed.<br/><br/>With an lie around, traveling through the universe was not too difficult!<br/><br/>As long as it was a teleportation, it would be completed.<br/><br/>Even if Tianci wanted to come back, it would be very easy!<br/><br/>Furthermore, Tianci had followed Wang Xian to the tree of chaos this time. He would be able to break through to the Heaven’s origin blessed realm after cultivating for at most 200 million years.<br/><br/>200 million years was not a long time for a group of powerhouses.<br/><br/>However, Mu Liyin ‘er could not bear to be separated from her child for such a long time. Hence, she wanted to go over together.<br/><br/>Following that, Mu Liyin ‘er’s father and the rest followed her.<br/><br/>Naturally, Wang Xian did not have any objections to this.<br/><br/>When they reached the Dragon Palace, it was not a bad thing for heaven’s gift to have some acquaintances!<br/><br/>“Let’s go, everyone. See you next time! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian gestured to an lie who was at the side. Then, he bowed to the spirits of the dead in sand city!<br/><br/>An Lie’s energy enveloped them and disappeared in an instant!<br/><br/>When they reappeared, they had already arrived at the tree of chaos.<br/><br/>The tree of chaos was comparable to a miniature universe. On its gigantic branches, the strong disciples of various races were cultivating..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
