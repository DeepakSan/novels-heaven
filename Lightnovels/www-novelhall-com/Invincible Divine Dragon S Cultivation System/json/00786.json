This trump card was very terrifying.<br/><br/>After all, it could almost trap an existence at the level seven of the Dominator realm.<br/><br/>Their trump card could be said to be very powerful.<br/><br/>However, their trump card was very powerful. Wang Xian’s trump card?<br/><br/>From the start, Wang Xian’s biggest trump card was the ancestral tree!<br/><br/>Yes, an ancestral tree that could grow to the level of the Heaven’s origin creation.<br/><br/>What was the concept of the Heaven’s origin creation’s ancestral tree?<br/><br/>That was, the rumored existence didn’t even exist among the peak races.<br/><br/>According to the rumors, no peak race had the existence of the Heaven’s origin creation realm.<br/><br/>And Wang Xian had it.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the ancestral tree was an auxiliary heaven’s origin creation realm.<br/><br/>The ability displayed by the ancestral tree at the moment could enhance the other divine tree divine fruits and grant them stronger abilities.<br/><br/>Was the ability of the ancestral tree strong?<br/><br/>It was very strong!<br/><br/>However, this was only so-so for existences at the Heaven’s origin creation level.<br/><br/>The ancestral tree had yet to reach its peak.<br/><br/>However, even if it had yet to reach its peak, it was still something that other treasures could not achieve.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s accompanying Elf and Netherspirit avatar were obtained because of the ancestral tree.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the five elemental millstone and the yin-yang Dragon Disc were born because of the five elemental origins and the heart of Light and darkness.<br/><br/>Back then, these two items were the strongest trump cards of the Five Elements Dragon King and the light and Darkness Dragon King.<br/><br/>What were the Five Elements Dragon King and the light and Darkness Dragon King?<br/><br/>They were once the strongest experts below the Heavenly Yuan Destiny Realm!<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s trump card was stronger than all of them had imagined.<br/><br/>“We can’t stop it. We’re finished!”<br/><br/>The pupils of the three level six masters of the universe contracted slightly when they saw this scene. An extremely ugly expression appeared on their faces.<br/><br/>They had the means to protect themselves. In fact, this means of self-protection could ensure the safety of all of them.<br/><br/>However, this required the rest of the phoenixes to get close to them.<br/><br/>If they did not get close now, the result was obvious.<br/><br/>“Die!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s speed was unleashed to the limit. Even if the phoenixes used up their lives to achieve Nirvana and unleash their powerful strength, they would not be able to withstand Wang Xian’s attack.<br/><br/>The gap between them was too big!<br/><br/>“PFFT!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian penetrated a phoenix’s body directly.<br/><br/>“No, no, no!”<br/><br/>He roared crazily with his eyes filled with anger and unwillingness!<br/><br/>“Whoosh!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and kept the corpse. His figure disappeared instantly.<br/><br/>“No, no, no!”<br/><br/>“Don’t kill me, don’t!”<br/><br/>When the other dozen or so phoenixes saw this scene, despair appeared on their faces.<br/><br/>This was especially so for those phoenixes that did not have any life-saving treasures.<br/><br/>However, their terrified voices were not of any use.<br/><br/>Wang Xian killed them one by one easily.<br/><br/>He immediately kept their corpses.<br/><br/>Twenty Phoenixes at the fourth and fifth level of the universe Dominators were all dead.<br/><br/>After killing them, Wang Xian waved his arm and kept the five elements millstone. His gaze was filled with mockery as he looked at the other three water phoenixes who were at the sixth level of the universe Dominators.<br/><br/>“Do you think you can escape with the trash of the Phoenix Clan?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at them coldly. His eyes were filled with mockery.<br/><br/>The three level six masters of the universe, the Water Phoenix, stared at Wang Xian with hatred in their eyes.<br/><br/>“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, don’t be complacent. It Won’t be long. It Won’t be long before our Phoenix clan will be able to annihilate all the strong disciples of Your Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>“Just you wait. Just you wait for our Phoenix Clan.”<br/><br/>They roared furiously.<br/><br/>“Hehe, your Phoenix clan has been trying to kill me for more than a hundred thousand years. I’m still not doing well. On the contrary, the strong practitioners of your Phoenix clan are constantly being killed by me. Over the past hundred thousand years, I’ve killed more than two hundred phoenixes above the overlord level. Hehe.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian chuckled. He held the five elements millstone and attacked them.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>The three water phoenixes who were at the Overlord level six waved their arms. The water ropes that were wrapped around the astral beasts at the Overlord level three surrounded them.<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm. A shadow of the Five Elements Millstone flew out and collided with it.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>The shadow collided with a water curtain that was formed from the entanglement of the five elements. The water curtain only trembled but there were no signs of cracking.<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and his eyes shone.<br/><br/>He raised his head slightly.<br/><br/>“Mighty Heavenly Dragon!”<br/><br/>An extremely terrifying divine dragon charged at them.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>The Divine Dragon collided with the water curtain again but was still blocked.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, you want to kill us? impossible. Just you wait. Sooner or later, I Will Make Your Dragon Palace pay ten times the price!”<br/><br/>A Water Phoenix who was at the sixth stage of the Dominator realm saw Wang Xian’s attack. His face was filled with killing intent and anger as he roared loudly.<br/><br/>“Hehe.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at them with a cold look in his eyes. “You are all useless and furious trash, right? The next time I meet you, you will still be useless and furious trash.”<br/><br/>As he spoke, he waved his arm and placed all the corpses of the Phoenix clan that he had killed in front of him. With a wave of his arm, he beheaded all of them.<br/><br/>In an instant, he took their storage space and started to check on them.<br/><br/>Since he couldn’t do anything to the three water phoenixes who were at level six, Wang Xian didn’t bother with them anymore.<br/><br/>He was already very satisfied with the spoils of war this time!<br/><br/>Twenty Phoenixes, six who were at level five, and fourteen who were at level four. He had gained a lot.<br/><br/>Other than that, there were also the treasures of these phoenixes.<br/><br/>Each phoenix had collected a large amount of resources over the past 100,000 years.<br/><br/>These resources could allow Wang Xian to improve greatly!<br/><br/>The harvest was Bountiful!<br/><br/>The bodies of the three phoenixes who were at level six of the Overlord realm trembled violently when they saw the corpses!<br/><br/>There were more than 12 corpses of these phoenixes. There were more than 50 of them.<br/><br/>All of them were powerhouses above the Overlord realm of their Phoenix clan.<br/><br/>Among them, there were two more who were at level five of the Overlord realm.<br/><br/>These phoenixes were all killed by the Dragon King!<br/><br/>The Phoenix clan had only killed a few hundred experts of the Dragon Palace clan over the years.<br/><br/>And they were all at the peak of the venerable realm.<br/><br/>It was incomparable to the losses of the Phoenix clan.<br/><br/>Not to mention that the Dragon King had killed two hundred of their sovereigns and above.<br/><br/>“Hu hu!”<br/><br/>“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”<br/><br/>“Dragon King, just you wait. One day, our Phoenix clan will behead you!”<br/><br/>The three water phoenixes were breathing rapidly. They let out a sharp cry and left quickly.<br/><br/>Wang Xian glanced at them with a mocking look in his eyes.<br/><br/>“It’s about time. It will be much more difficult to kill the strong practitioners of the Phoenix tribe and the Angel tribe in the future. I can display these battle achievements now.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
