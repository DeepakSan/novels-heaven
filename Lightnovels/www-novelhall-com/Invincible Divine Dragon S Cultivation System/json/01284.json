He continued to fly in one direction!<br/><br/>After flying for two years, Wang Xian arrived at the central area of the riot zone.<br/><br/>When he was close to this area, he could feel the terrifying energy coming from the front.<br/><br/>The area in front of him was the origin of the riot zone.<br/><br/>All the light came from here!<br/><br/>In front of him, there were special meteorites floating in the air.<br/><br/>These meteorites carried a special and terrifying energy.<br/><br/>From time to time, he could see some meteorites attacking each other.<br/><br/>The energy released by the meteorites attacking each other was extremely terrifying!<br/><br/>Every attack was at the level of a heaven’s origin creator.<br/><br/>And the attacks of these meteorites seemed to come from instinct.<br/><br/>It was as if they had met two elemental gods with different attributes and engaged in an instinctive battle!<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the position in front of him and then looked at the treasure map in his hand. He directly crushed the treasure map with a powerful force!<br/><br/>The situation recorded in the treasure map had changed.<br/><br/>According to the treasure map, there was a huge meteorite at this location.<br/><br/>This meteorite exuded a strong vitality. If he could obtain it, he would be able to achieve an incredible improvement.<br/><br/>However, the meteorite at this location had disappeared!<br/><br/>In other words, this treasure map was useless!<br/><br/>He destroyed it immediately!<br/><br/>“It’s hard to tell if the treasure map is real or fake. I shouldn’t be disturbed by the information on it!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself as he scanned his surroundings.<br/><br/>According to the information he obtained from the Heaven’s origin communication device, the meteorites in the center were called Chaos Stones.<br/><br/>Chaos stones contained all kinds of energy.<br/><br/>However, these energies were all condensed together. They couldn’t be refined or used!<br/><br/>They would be like the elemental gods, carrying out unintentional attacks.<br/><br/>If one were to go deep inside and suffer the chaos of these chaos gems, then everything in the surroundings would be disturbed.<br/><br/>Some of the escaping treasures could not be used.<br/><br/>If one could not withstand the energy fluctuations of the chaos gems’attacks, then they would fall inside.<br/><br/>Such chaos gem riots often happened inside.<br/><br/>Therefore, every heavenly fate expert who entered would be extremely cautious!<br/><br/>However, there were many fragments of the Elemental God in the center.<br/><br/>These fragments were also rare treasures for heavenly fate experts.<br/><br/>As for those in the ruler realm, they were even more so!<br/><br/>Other than the elemental fragments, there were also special polished treasures.<br/><br/>The chaos gem contained all kinds of energy. Some of the energy in the Chaos Gem was polished into a special form and had individual attributes. It could be used as a weapon.<br/><br/>Some of the weapons were as powerful as a beginner in the Heaven’s origin realm.<br/><br/>Although they were not as powerful as the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin realm, they were still comparable to the five elements millstone.<br/><br/>Therefore, there were still many powerhouses who could not help but enter and take risks.<br/><br/>However, there were also many strong people who died in there!<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not enter directly.<br/><br/>He had to enter such a dangerous place after he had a clear understanding of it.<br/><br/>His body moved and Wang Xian began to observe the area around him.<br/><br/>While he was observing, he could occasionally see some strong people in the Heaven’s origin realm who were also observing the area.<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not get close to them. Both parties maintained a safe distance!<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>At the same time, while Wang Xian was observing the area at the center of the riot zone.<br/><br/>It was located at a location not far away.<br/><br/>There were many tall towers here. The tall towers were engraved with magic patterns.<br/><br/>The entire magic pattern was emitting a luster.<br/><br/>At the top of the tall towers, there were many resplendent fragments of the elemental god.<br/><br/>Each fragment seemed to be worth a lot!<br/><br/>One could see with the naked eye that waves of energy were entering the elemental god from the center of the riot.<br/><br/>The energy guided by the Elemental God entered the lower part of the tower.<br/><br/>At the lower part of the tower, there was a pillar!<br/><br/>Within each pillar, there were dozens of ruler realm disciples cultivating!<br/><br/>And in the middle of the eight towers, there was a small palace!<br/><br/>In the palace, there were four powerhouses in the Tianyuan blessed realm sitting cross-legged inside.<br/><br/>Suddenly, a bright lamp beside a Tianyuan blessed realm powerhouse suddenly emitted a luster!<br/><br/>The light of the bright lamp suddenly began to change and finally, it formed a figure.<br/><br/>And this figure was exactly the same as Wang Xian who was not far away!<br/><br/>This sudden change stunned the tianyuan manifestation powerhouse beside him for a moment. Then, he stood up immediately!<br/><br/>His eyes were filled with excitement.<br/><br/>“Patriarch, what’s the situation?”<br/><br/>The other three Tianyuan manifestation powerhouses looked over in astonishment when they saw his sudden change.<br/><br/>“The divination lamp has lit up. An expert with a fragment of the Starfield has appeared in the surroundings!”<br/><br/>The Heavenly Yuan creation expert said excitedly!<br/><br/>“Is that so? It’s such a coincidence that a starfield fragment has appeared in the surroundings. Sect ancestor, this is your treasure. We must obtain it!”<br/><br/>The other three heavenly yuan creation experts were filled with joy.<br/><br/>The Heavenly Yuan Creation Treasure Starfield was a treasure that was born in their universe.<br/><br/>Because their sect master entered the chaotic region with the supreme treasure, he was attacked by the primal chaos stones.<br/><br/>Not only did he die in there, even the star field was broken into pieces!<br/><br/>The power of the Heavenly Fate Supreme Treasure Star Field was extremely huge, especially in the chaotic region, it had a huge advantage.<br/><br/>Once, the exquisite universe’s saint saint also relied on this heavenly fate supreme treasure to become the Supreme Master of the exquisite universe.<br/><br/>He had also established the most powerful force in the Linglong universe, the Heavenly Saint Realm.<br/><br/>He had used the starfield to enter this chaotic region and obtained a large amount of resources.<br/><br/>In fact, the three of them had been able to break through because of their sect leader.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, they had already searched for tens of billions of years for this starfield fragment, but they were still unable to gather it.<br/><br/>Now, they had actually sensed the existence of the starfield fragment.<br/><br/>How could they not be pleasantly surprised!<br/><br/>“Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>Saint Shan Tian’s gaze focused. Without any hesitation, he held the divination lamp and flew out instantly!<br/><br/>The other three Heaven’s origin creation powerhouses followed closely behind!<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>Soon, they stopped in the void and looked at the figure in front of them.<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian, who was observing the situation in the riot zone, suddenly felt four pairs of eyes staring at him. He revealed a surprised expression.<br/><br/>He looked over and sized up the four figures.<br/><br/>“Great Dao level!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian landed on the old man who was holding an ancient oil lamp, his gaze froze slightly!<br/><br/>Great Dao level. His aura was weaker than the fallen Shadow Devil Emperor.<br/><br/>It should be an existence who had just stepped into the Great Dao realm!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
