With these treasures, the disciples of the Dragon Palace will be cultivating at the tree of Chaos. Next, we will have a huge increase in strength! ”<br/><br/>In the Dragon Palace, Prime Minister Gui handed a set of documents to Wang Xian and said excitedly.<br/><br/>This time, the Dragon Palace’s gains were too great!<br/><br/>Okay!<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze and revealed a satisfied expression. Following that, he looked at prime minister GUI and said, “Call all the disciples at the peak of the Universe Dominator realm in the dragon palace over. ”<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui nodded. Soon, twenty disciples at the peak of the Universe Dominator realm flew over.<br/><br/>Recently, the Dragon Palace had added two more existences at the peak of the ruler realm.<br/><br/>Ao qitian, Ao Qi, Mu Ze, Sen Ao Jian, and the other leaders had all reached the peak of the ruler realm.<br/><br/>Bei Shuang had also reached the peak of the ruler realm. Apart from them, there were ten purebred divine dragons.<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>“Greetings, Master! ”<br/><br/>The twenty disciples of the Dragon Palace came over and immediately bowed respectfully.<br/><br/>Wang Xian glanced at them and nodded his head in satisfaction.<br/><br/>(‘I called you here because I have something to tell you. It’s a good thing for you. ”<br/><br/>“All of you have already reached the peak of the universe’s ruler. Our Dragon Palace currently has me and Lin Niu, the two Heaven’s origin destiny realm cultivators. We still need more Heaven’s origin destiny realm powerhouses to appear.”<br/><br/>(‘I have some resources here for you to cultivate. Try to reach the peak of the ruler realm as soon as possible. Try to touch the threshold of the Heavenly Yuan destiny realm as soon as possible. Once you have reached this realm, I will bring you to the universe for a breakthrough!”<br/><br/>“Ao Qitian, Yao Mu Zesen, all of you have many attributes in your bodies. It will be difficult for you to break through. You can ask Lin Niu about this. He has many attributes as well. You can also take this path by using the bloodline method to break through. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke to them one by one.<br/><br/>Ao Qitian and the rest all had three attributes. It would be too difficult for them to combine the three attributes and achieve a breakthrough at the same time!<br/><br/>Currently, there were no cases of multiple attribute breakthroughs in the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>However, apart from attribute breakthroughs, there was also a bloodline breakthrough!<br/><br/>A bloodline breakthrough was just like the LINNIU.<br/><br/>It would increase the strength in the bloodline and complete the breakthrough.<br/><br/>Ao Qitian and the others, as peak dragon species, could also be considered as a special bloodline species.<br/><br/>They were equally powerful and could also make a breakthrough.<br/><br/>The Divine Dragon Clan cultivated not only the attributes but also the physical body and bloodline. It was also a powerful foundation.<br/><br/>However, if Ao Qitian and the others wanted to make a breakthrough, it would probably be a little more difficult than a group of pure-bred divine dragons.<br/><br/>In addition, they also had to find those special universes.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King. Thank you for your cultivation. We will definitely work hard to cultivate and strive to reach the Heavenly Yuan Destiny Realm to serve you, Dragon King.”<br/><br/>Ao Qitian and the others said with excitement and loyalty.<br/><br/>The loyalty of the disciples of the Dragon Palace was beyond doubt.<br/><br/>“Cultivate well. I’ll give you a corpse of an expert who believes in the Heavenly Yuan Destiny Realm. There’s a heart of faith in the corpse. You can absorb it together. ”<br/><br/>“In addition, the resources in the Dragon Palace can be mobilized as you wish when you can improve your own strength. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued to speak to them.<br/><br/>If the Dragon Palace could produce more heaven origin creator powerhouses, then the Dragon Palace would be truly powerful.<br/><br/>Truly Invincible.<br/><br/>His expectations were not high. It would be enough if he could reach the void universe.<br/><br/>The Void Universe was controlled by the Void dynasty, and they had only one king.<br/><br/>The king of the Void dynasty was the supreme existence in the Void Universe.<br/><br/>They were equivalent to a force, and they had many powerhouses in the Heavenly Yuan Destiny Realm.<br/><br/>It was not very difficult to train the disciples of the Dragon Palace to the Heavenly Yuan Destiny Realm.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the Dragon Palace had too many resources at the moment.<br/><br/>The most important thing was the heart of faith.<br/><br/>The Heart of faith at the Heavenly Fate Realm.<br/><br/>And there were two of them.<br/><br/>For a master at the peak of the Dominator realm, this was simply an unparalleled treasure.<br/><br/>It was far from being comparable to the god of elements fragments and the corpses of other Heavenly Fate Realm Masters.<br/><br/>Of course, apart from the heart of faith, there was also a complete body of a heavenly fate water elemental master.<br/><br/>This body was comparable to the heart of faith.<br/><br/>That was because it was a complete body.<br/><br/>With such a huge amount of resources, it should not be a problem to nurture a heaven’s origin powerhouse.<br/><br/>(‘I hope the Dragon Palace can have more Heaven’s origin powerhouses. It will be a little difficult for me to break through now. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled.<br/><br/>Even if all the resources of the entire Phoenix clan were devoured by Wang Xian, they were still far from enough for him to level up.<br/><br/>According to his estimation, he would need at least three Phoenix clan’s resources to allow him to make a breakthrough.<br/><br/>This also made Wang Xian less anxious.<br/><br/>The resources of the Phoenix clan would be used to upgrade the disciples of the Dragon Palace first.<br/><br/>His strength could be improved after the arrival of the apocalypse.<br/><br/>When the Apocalypse arrived, there would be a big battle.<br/><br/>There would be a fight for resources.<br/><br/>They would fight for a spot.<br/><br/>The nine-origin universe would not be spared.<br/><br/>They were enemies with the Void Universe. When the time came, there would definitely be a huge battle. It would be a stalemate for a long time.<br/><br/>“Next, let’s wait for the calamity to arrive.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself.<br/><br/>A few days later, the floating queen held a celebratory ceremony.<br/><br/>A group of powerhouses from the Heaven’s origin realm gathered.<br/><br/>They also took this opportunity to chat a little.<br/><br/>In the following period of time, the nine-origin universe completely stabilized.<br/><br/>The grudges between the various races had all been settled.<br/><br/>The disciples of the various races all buried their heads in cultivation.<br/><br/>This time, the tree of Chaos appeared beside the nine-origin universe, making the power of the nine-origin universe unprecedentedly strong.<br/><br/>According to the Elven empress, this time, the strength of the nine-origin universe was the strongest state that she knew of.<br/><br/>The number of experts at the disciples’ side had also far surpassed the previous Aeon Tribulations. It was even double the number of the previous Aeon Tribulations.<br/><br/>The strength of the heaven-origin creation stage experts had the addition of Wang Xian, as well as their combat strength that was comparable to the Great Dao level.<br/><br/>This time, the nine-origin universe might be able to attack the void space.<br/><br/>During the last calamity, the Void Universe occupied the upper sky.<br/><br/>Some void towers in the Void universe even invaded the nine-origin universe and killed many living beings.<br/><br/>This time, it was hard to say.<br/><br/>From the Elven empress, Wang Xian also learned about the origin of the grudge between the Void Universe and the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>It was all because of the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan, the artificial intelligence!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
