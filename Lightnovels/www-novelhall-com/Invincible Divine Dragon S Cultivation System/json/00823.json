Cursed Dragon!”<br/><br/>Lan Qingyue’s eyes sparkled when she saw the tens of thousands of cursed dragons being brought over by an lie.<br/><br/>Cursed Dragon!<br/><br/>The most unique dragon species in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>This was a type of dragon species that could commit suicide.<br/><br/>When they appeared, they would commit suicide.<br/><br/>Fortunately, after they committed suicide, they could resurrect with the tree branches of the soul returning tree!<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace of the curse rarely used them. In fact, they didn’t even use them during the war.<br/><br/>This was because all the great beings in the 9-origin universe knew about the existence of the cursed creatures.<br/><br/>In addition, the power of the dragon of the curse was very weak.<br/><br/>Now that the dragon of the curse had reached the pinnacle of the venerable realm, it had basically reached its limit.<br/><br/>They had no chance of breaking through!<br/><br/>This was also the reason why the Dragon Palace didn’t have many cursed dragons at the moment.<br/><br/>There were a total of 50,000 of them.<br/><br/>50,000 of them was considered the least among the eight million in the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a roar came from the back. Following that, waves of terrifying energy attacked Wang Xian and the rest!<br/><br/>“1,000 disciples of the Cursed Dragon, go up and meet them!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s expression changed drastically when he saw this terrifying attack!<br/><br/>He immediately ordered the group of Cursed Dragons!<br/><br/>The cursed dragons also understood their usage. Without any hesitation, they moved their bodies and immediately went up to meet the terrifying attack!<br/><br/>1,000 cursed dragons immediately went up to meet the energy!<br/><br/>Lan Qingyue and the great mill of the five elements immediately released their strongest defenses.<br/><br/>As for the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, it had completely collapsed. It would take a very long time to repair it.<br/><br/>This time would probably take thousands of years, or even tens of thousands of years!<br/><br/>After all, the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, which was now the ruler of a level nine realm, would not recover so easily after collapsing!<br/><br/>Fortunately, the Tai Chi Dragon Plate was mainly formed from the Dragon Soul and the heart of Light and darkness.<br/><br/>As long as the Dragon Soul was still around, as long as the heart of Light and darkness was still around, it could slowly recover.<br/><br/>As for Wang Xian, he had yet to encounter such an energy to destroy the dragon soul.<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>A Thousand Cursed Dragons roared. Faced with the energy that could destroy them, they did not panic at all. In fact, they were not afraid at all!<br/><br/>Although the cursed dragons had to pay with their lives since they were born.<br/><br/>However, they didn’t need to cultivate like the other dragons in the Dragon Palace. They needed to improve. They were still very relaxed in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Furthermore, they could be revived.<br/><br/>There was a saying that one would gain a lot of things while losing something.<br/><br/>There were pros and cons. Becoming a cursed dragon was the choice of many members in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>This was the first time Wang Xian had used a cursed dragon!<br/><br/>Before the 1,000 cursed dragons could reach the front, the terrifying energy fluctuations caused them to collapse instantly.<br/><br/>Instant Death!<br/><br/>After all, the gap was still too big!<br/><br/>However, at the moment of their death, a strange energy and a strange killing curse surged towards the space beast that was at level seven!<br/><br/>This attack was strange and terrifying!<br/><br/>They couldn’t defend or Dodge, they could only take it head on!<br/><br/>“WUUUUU!”<br/><br/>However, this attack from the Level 7 ruler-level astral beast still quickly caused the five elements grinding attack to collapse and land on the small house’s body.<br/><br/>When the energy landed on his body, more than half of his body was quickly wiped out.<br/><br/>This was even under the circumstances where he had the full support of Lan Qingyue and Xiao Bai.<br/><br/>Faced with the attack of this furious Space Beast, the little house could only withstand two to three attacks at most!<br/><br/>This was even under the situation where he had the support of the five elements grindstone!<br/><br/>After blocking the attack, Wang Xian fixed his gaze on the situation of the Space Beast.<br/><br/>In addition, another 1,000 cursed dragons flew out, ready to launch a suicidal attack!<br/><br/>With 1,000 cursed dragons, Wang Xian didn’t have much confidence in killing a level seven space beast.<br/><br/>After all, this wasn’t an ordinary ruler.<br/><br/>Instead, it was a level seven ruler.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it was a space beast with extremely tenacious vitality!<br/><br/>“Attack!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian saw that the space beast only let out an intense scream and immediately ordered the other 1,000 cursed dragons.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>The 1,000 cursed dragons did not hesitate at all. They charged forward like moths to a flame!<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>When the Space Beast, who was in pain, saw another 1,000 ants charging at it, its body only trembled.<br/><br/>A wave of dark red energy swept out!<br/><br/>The 1,000 cursed dragons died instantly!<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>After the 1,000 cursed dragons died, an increasingly desperate voice came out from the mouth of this space beast.<br/><br/>The voice that shook the heavens and earth spread throughout the entire space!<br/><br/>His life force was disappearing at a terrifying speed!<br/><br/>“It seems to have succeeded!”<br/><br/>Lan qingyue stared at it closely as she sensed the life force of this space beast. Her eyes sparkled!<br/><br/>“Indeed.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian watched as the life force of the Space Beast, which was the overlord of the level seven realm, rapidly disappeared under the backlash of the 2,000 cursed dragons.<br/><br/>2,000 cursed dragons could destroy a space beast that was the overlord of the universe at the level seven realm. This was worth it for Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Of course, Wang Xian couldn’t do such things frequently.<br/><br/>This was because it would take a long time for the cursed dragons to be resurrected.<br/><br/>There was a limit to the number of cursed dragons in the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>After resurrecting, they would need a lot of resources to advance to the peak of the supremacy realm!<br/><br/>“They are completely dead.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at the Cosmic Beast and smiled when he saw its complete death.<br/><br/>“Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>Next, it was time to reap the rewards!<br/><br/>Wang Xian didn’t really care about the corpse of a level seven master of the universe.<br/><br/>What he cared about was the value of the territory in front of him.<br/><br/>This land of treasures was very strange. That incomparably huge material was also very strange!<br/><br/>The entire space territory was very strange.<br/><br/>Furthermore, according to what Wang Xian knew, the space beasts in the universe were born from planets.<br/><br/>Of course, it was not just the birth of planets. It could also be the birth of space beasts from other treasures!<br/><br/>Wang Xian suspected that the space beasts here were born from this domain.<br/><br/>This was because the energy fluctuations in this domain were too similar to those space beasts!<br/><br/>Swoosh<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest flew over and took a look at the corpse. With a move of his palm, he took out the soul-returning wood branch.<br/><br/>“An lie, bring them back. There are also some corpses of the space beasts here. Bring them back as well!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian instructed an lie.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>An lie nodded.<br/><br/>“Let’s go, qingyue. Let’s see what treasures are hidden here!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew forward in a good mood.<br/><br/>It could be said that the value of this place was definitely far beyond the treasures occupied by other peak races.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
