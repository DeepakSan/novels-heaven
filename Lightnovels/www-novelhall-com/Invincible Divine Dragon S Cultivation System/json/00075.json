After entering the ruins, I obtained an opportunity. My strength rose to level two divine emperor and the Earth Divine Dragon rose to level six divine emperor.”<br/><br/>“After we came out, we were chased by a few experts and escaped to the Milky Way. We have been in the Milky Way for five years and met Sister Ling Yuan and the rest.”<br/><br/>In the room where the fairy dragons were, Sun Lingxiu told Wang Xian everything that had happened over the past few years.<br/><br/>It had been more than ten years since they were chased here. Wang Xian felt a little heartache as he stroked her hair.<br/><br/>“Such things will not happen again in the future!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said with a determined gaze.<br/><br/>“Okay!”<br/><br/>Sun Lingxiu nodded her head happily.<br/><br/>“By the way, why are you guys staying in such a secret place? Is it because of the humans?”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian looked around and swept his gaze across Xianlingyuan and the rest.<br/><br/>Regarding the Fairy Dragon Clan, Wang Xian had heard about it from the moxin deer not long ago. This was the only Asian Dragon Clan in the Milky Way that possessed the strength of a domain-level race.<br/><br/>“Yes, Xiao Xian. In the current universe, the situation of the Asian Dragon clan is not very good. Unless they can break through to a primary-level race in the universe, they will be hunted down by other races. They will be used as mounts or even sold!”<br/><br/>Sun Lingxiu said with a slight frown.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded. He was already very clear about the current situation of the inferior dragon in the universe.<br/><br/>“With your strength, although you are not too strong in the Milky Way, you should not be too weak either. Could it be that primary race of the Universe?”<br/><br/>His eyes flickered as he scanned his surroundings.<br/><br/>Based on his senses, there were three powerhouses at the peak of the divine emperor stage among the fairy dragon race in the room. In addition, the Earth Divine Dragon was also at the peak of the divine emperor stage. It should not be in such a situation.<br/><br/>Unless, there was a primary race of the universe hunting them down.<br/><br/>“It’s a primary race of the universe. It’s the dragon race, the nine-sword race, and the skeleton race. Some of them want to capture us as their mounts, and some want our bloodline.”<br/><br/>By the side, Xian Lingyuan said with a sullen face. She looked at Sun Lingxiu, there was a hint of apology on her face. “Lingxiu has even broken through to the seventh-stage celestial emperor realm, but because she forcefully treated the injured disciples of our fairy dragon race, her cultivation has regressed.”<br/><br/>“Originally, our Fairy Dragon Clan had more than 10,000 disciples. Now, we only have a few thousand.”<br/><br/>As she spoke, a look of hatred appeared in her eyes.<br/><br/>“Oh? The dragon race, the nine-sword race, and the skeleton race.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly as killing intent flickered in his eyes.<br/><br/>“Little Xian, they are the three primary races of the universe. Many members of the Fairy Dragon Clan died in their hands and were captured by them.”<br/><br/>Sun Lingxiu also clenched her fists, her eyes revealing a cold expression.<br/><br/>With her light origin constitution, she had an extremely kind nature, and she even had the tendency of being a holy mother.<br/><br/>To be able to make her so angry, one could imagine how angry she was towards the three primary races.<br/><br/>“If it weren’t for Lingxiu’s Earth God Dragon, our fairy dragon race might have perished because of it.”<br/><br/>At the side, Xianlingyuan’s face was filled with bitterness.<br/><br/>“The reason why the Earth God Dragon could improve so quickly is because of the huge resources you guys have provided.”<br/><br/>Sun Lingxiu said.<br/><br/>“Have you been hiding here all this while?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them and sighed in his heart.<br/><br/>“We are prepared to hide here all the time. When the Earth God Dragon’s strength breaks through to the universe knight realm, we will be able to have a domain in the Milky Way and develop slowly.”<br/><br/>As Sun Lingxiu spoke, Xian Lingyuan and the rest nodded.<br/><br/>“I wonder if you are interested in joining the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian pondered for a moment and sent out an invitation.<br/><br/>The Fairy Dragon clan belonged to the sub-dragon clan. Their bloodline was not very low and was comparable to an ordinary dragon.<br/><br/>But that was all.<br/><br/>Without resources and cultivation methods, it was very difficult to break through to the Universe Knight Realm.<br/><br/>“Join the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>Xian Lingyuan was slightly stunned. She looked at the few elders at the side.<br/><br/>“You have the bloodline of the Divine Dragon, but the bloodline is still very thin. In addition, you probably don’t have the cultivation method of the Divine Dragon. It’s very difficult to break through to the Universe Knight Realm.”<br/><br/>“Our Dragon Palace is a clan with the pure bloodline of the Divine Dragon. We have the complete inheritance of the Divine Dragon.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to them.<br/><br/>The other party was Lingxiu’s friend. Furthermore, over the past few years, Lingxiu had obviously merged with the Fairy Dragon Clan as a family.<br/><br/>For them to be able to join the Dragon Palace, it was a significant boost to the strength of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“The Pure Divine Dragon Bloodline, the complete inheritance of the Divine Dragon?”<br/><br/>Xianlingyuan and the elders of the fairy dragon clan were slightly shocked. Their eyes revealed a heated expression.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head faintly. With a wave of his arm, the divine dragon spiraled around him. It was the true divine dragon technique.<br/><br/>“It’s fine to join the Dragon Palace, but we hope that the Dragon Palace can help us take revenge!”<br/><br/>Xianlingyuan and the few elders looked at each other and spoke with hatred in their eyes.<br/><br/>“Little Xian, Lingyuan’s mother, the old clan leader, was killed by the dragon race a few years ago. All of her dragon blood was extracted and her body was used to refine pills… so…”<br/><br/>From the side, Sun Lingxiu transmitted her voice to him in a low voice.<br/><br/>“Alright, the dragon race, the nine-sword race, and the skeleton race. I will definitely exterminate them. In the future, I will not spare anyone who covets the Dragon Race!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes also revealed a stern look.<br/><br/>Around the ruins of the Mo Han clan, some factions were coveting the Divine Dragon Bloodline.<br/><br/>Now, in the Milky Way, the Asian dragon was killed and used as a mount.<br/><br/>If the Dragon God wanted to rise again, Roar in the starry sky and stand at the top of the universe, he would have to kill his way out.<br/><br/>A wave of dragon power condensed from his body.<br/><br/>“Okay, we believe in you and sister Lingxiu. If the Dragon Palace can help us take revenge, we are willing to do anything.”<br/><br/>Xianlingyuan and the others stood up and said with determination in their eyes.<br/><br/>“All you need to do is to be loyal. There’s no need for anything else.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head and scanned his surroundings. “I want to build the Dragon Palace here. After the Dragon Palace is completed, you can go to the other areas that we currently control.”<br/><br/>“Build the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>Xianlingyuan and the rest were astonished.<br/><br/>“Sister Lingyuan, you can just watch from the side!”<br/><br/>Sun Lingxiu said to them.<br/><br/>Wang Xian gestured to Sun Lingxiu and flew outside.<br/><br/>“All Disciples of the Fairy Dragon, fly to the sky!”<br/><br/>Sun Lingxiu followed closely behind and her voice spread over a hundred kilometers.<br/><br/>Now that she had a high status in the fairy dragon, the group of Fairy Dragons flew into the sky curiously and looked in their direction.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the resources in his hands and immediately built a level-eight dragon palace.<br/><br/>Under their shocked gazes, a dragon palace appeared in their sight at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>“Break through the Dragon Gate. With your bloodline, you should be able to break through easily. Don’t put up any resistance.”<br/><br/>After the Dragon Palace was built, Wang Xian reminded all the fairy dragons.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
