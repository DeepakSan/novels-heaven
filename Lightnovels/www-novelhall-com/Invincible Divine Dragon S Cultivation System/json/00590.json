The success rate will be increased by at least 30% !”<br/><br/>He mumbled!<br/><br/>With the current powerful strength of the spirit red bone, he could fight against more than 20 level 3 universe masters with Combat Strength!<br/><br/>This time, as long as the experts from the six races of the Holy Dragon Lineage were separated.<br/><br/>Even if 100 level 3 universe masters were divided into two teams, Wang Xian was confident that he could destroy them!<br/><br/>The 50 Level 3 universe masters from the Dragon Palace, one against one, would be able to hold them back!<br/><br/>As for him and Ling honggu, they would be able to engage in a frenzied massacre!<br/><br/>As he pondered, a smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face!<br/><br/>This time, he wanted to make the six great races of the Holy Dragon lineage pay a heavy price!<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. At the same time, in the void space within the heaven-splitting primordial land, a terrifying team was flying in the sky!<br/><br/>It was a gigantic ancient god’s corpse, a towering divine mountain carried by a dozen giants, a gigantic monster formed from countless insects, a terrifying and evil dark swamp, and a black fog!<br/><br/>They shuttled through the void space. Every time they passed by, that terrifying aura would make all the living beings around them tremble!<br/><br/>Soon, they appeared in the sky above a city. That terrifying aura made everyone within the city feel incomparably terrified!<br/><br/>“This… This is the power of the six great races, the sacred dragon lineage, and the god herding clan. Their power is actually so terrifying!”<br/><br/>“This time, all the Great Beings with power above the universe master level should have come. This aura is too terrifying!”<br/><br/>“Look at that ancient god corpse, that terrifying mountain peak, and that terrifying bug. Hiss!”<br/><br/>When all the great beings and disciples in the city saw this scene, their faces were filled with shock!<br/><br/>“Black Fog Spirit clan, with your talent power, absorb our God Mountain for a short period of time.”<br/><br/>They came to the sky above the city, and the patriarch of the light giant clan said!<br/><br/>“Good, immediately get the people below to prepare the teleportation array. We can only absorb your divine mountain and the ancient god corpse for a few dozen seconds. We can’t hold on for too long!”<br/><br/>In the Black Fog, the patriarch of the Black Fog Spirit clan slowly walked out and said!<br/><br/>“No Problem!”<br/><br/>The clan leader of the light giant clan nodded.<br/><br/>The black fog slowly absorbed the Divine Mountain and the god corpse. The black fog shrank at a terrifying speed!<br/><br/>“Whoosh! Whoosh!”<br/><br/>The Sacred Dragon King and the others directly flew towards the teleportation array!<br/><br/>They didn’t need to say anything. At the location of the teleportation array, everyone made a path for them to carry out the teleportation!<br/><br/>All the powerful disciples looked at them with respect.<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>Soon, they disappeared and arrived at the next city!<br/><br/>When their power was released, it made all the powerful disciples in the other city tremble!<br/><br/>“The power of the Sacred Dragon King and his race is too terrifying. The power of the universe overlords should be around 1,500 to 1,600. If the Dragon Palace can still resist it, then the Dragon Palace is too heaven-defying!”<br/><br/>Some people watched them leave as they muttered to themselves!<br/><br/>The Holy Dragon King and the other six races did not hide their route, and they could not hide it either!<br/><br/>Such a mighty power was known by all the forces in the entire heaven-splitting primordial land!<br/><br/>Wang Xian could also clearly know their current location!<br/><br/>More than ten days later, an lie found an opportunity to enter the interior of the Blessed Land of the god-herding race and sent the eight-limbed demon Fiend there!<br/><br/>A month later, the eight-limbed demon fiend and the other two found an opportunity to parasitize the body of the strongest person in the blessed land of the god-herding race!<br/><br/>An expert with the combat strength of a Master of the universe at level three!<br/><br/>He was also the last strongest person to stay in the god-herding race!<br/><br/>Once he parasitized him, the matter would be much simpler!<br/><br/>The eight-limbed demon fiend immediately sent a few very useful messages to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>Firstly, the god-herding race had indeed prepared themselves well for this expedition!<br/><br/>In order to prevent the Dragon Palace from attacking their lair, all the races were like the god-herding race.<br/><br/>Secondly, if something really happened, they would return immediately. The experts from three races would go back to provide support while the other three races would wait!<br/><br/>When they returned, they didn’t bring war items like the ancient God’s corpse. The races that stayed here would use special treasures to set up a formation to summon them over!<br/><br/>Of course, setting up this formation to summon them would consume a lot of energy!<br/><br/>Moreover, they would need an equal number of experts to maintain it!<br/><br/>In other words, a level 3 universe overlord could only summon an expert of the same level!<br/><br/>In short, they could bear this price!<br/><br/>“This time, they have a total of 108 level 3 universe overlords. If half of them come back, that would be 54 experts. They can be easily dealt with!”<br/><br/>After receiving this news, Wang Xian revealed a smile!<br/><br/>As long as the other party split up, he was confident that he could destroy them!<br/><br/>“This time, the target is still the group of masters who are waiting there!”<br/><br/>He thought to himself!<br/><br/>With the current strength of the Dragon Palace, they could deal with the masters who came to support them!<br/><br/>However, after seeing the terrifying strength of the Dragon Palace, those who came to support them could continue to ask for reinforcements from the group of masters who were waiting!<br/><br/>This way, the other party could also rush over to provide assistance!<br/><br/>If that was the case, it would be troublesome to destroy them!<br/><br/>As long as the group of experts who were waiting were not allowed to escape back to their Cosmos God nation, they would be isolated even if they wanted to request for assistance!<br/><br/>After destroying them, they would return!<br/><br/>It was a perfect plan!<br/><br/>He took out the cosmos AI and sent a message to Ling Hong Gu, asking him to wait in a city for an lie to pick her up!<br/><br/>More than ten days passed. Most of the powerhouses in the Blessed Land of the shepherd God race were infected by the poisonous horned dragon species!<br/><br/>An lie immediately rushed to Ling Honggu’s place.<br/><br/>“Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Two days later, an lie brought Ling honggu over.<br/><br/>“Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>Ling Honggu looked at Wang Xian with a twinkle in her eyes as she shouted!<br/><br/>“Thank you, Princess Ling Honggu!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the gorgeous ling Honggu and thanked her!<br/><br/>She was dressed in a red dress and had fiery red lips. Her figure was perfect!<br/><br/>No one would believe that she was a member of the spirit demon race and belonged to the skeleton race!<br/><br/>“You have helped me so much. This is just a small matter!”<br/><br/>Ling Honggu said with a smile.<br/><br/>“There will be a big battle soon. Be careful, Princess Ling Honggu.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian and Ling honggu were chatting.<br/><br/>Ling Honggu didn’t mind at all. In her opinion, Wang Xian had helped her too much!<br/><br/>Without him, it would be impossible for him to step into the realm of the ruler of the universe!<br/><br/>Compared to Wang Xian’s kindness, her help was nothing!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
