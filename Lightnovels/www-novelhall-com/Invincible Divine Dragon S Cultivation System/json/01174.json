Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>In the sky, a heaven’s origin creator wanted to control Heaven’s Gift!<br/><br/>In the next ten seconds, all kinds of energy waves penetrated through the defenses of the Golden Leopard and sand city and landed around Heaven’s Gift!<br/><br/>However, this time, all the energy waves were blocked by Wang Xian!<br/><br/>This caused some of the Heaven’s origin powerhouses who were secretly attacking in the sky to frown.<br/><br/>They did not suspect Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Even though they knew that Wang Xian was also a heaven’s origin powerhouse.<br/><br/>“It seems that the Heaven’s origin treasure has a special energy.<br/><br/>They attributed the failure of their abilities to the Heaven’s origin treasure in their bodies.<br/><br/>The battle continued!<br/><br/>The terrifying battle caused the Great Beings ‘disciples from the six paths universe to be filled with fear and horror!<br/><br/>They wanted to escape, but they couldn’t.<br/><br/>The terrifying energy fluctuations around them made them realize that they couldn’t even mobilize the energy around them.<br/><br/>Some of the treasures that could make them teleport directly lost their effects due to the strong energy disturbance!<br/><br/>It was as if they were in the center of hell!<br/><br/>They prayed that the flames of Hell would not descend on them!<br/><br/>All the experts at the peak of the universe’s ruler realm gathered together to support their energy. They were ready to defend themselves at any time!<br/><br/>However, at this moment, the experts at the peak of the universe’s ruler realm were gathered.<br/><br/>The experts from the dead tribe focused their gaze!<br/><br/>They looked at where Wang Xian and Tianci were and immediately flew over!<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>The three experts who were at the peak of the Dead Tribe’s Dominator realm flew to Wang Xian’s side and greeted him respectfully!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw them flying over, he raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at them indifferently!<br/><br/>“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, we have already sent all the information here to our Lord of the dead. Our Lord said that they won’t be able to hold on for long. Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, do you have any backup plans? Can you protect the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan?”<br/><br/>The tribal patriarch of the dead tribe continued to speak to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“Tell the dead that the Ultimate Treasure of Tianyuan Destiny belongs to my godson, Mu Litian. It belongs to him naturally.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them and spoke!<br/><br/>“It’s you, Dragon King!<br/><br/>The three top-notch masters of the dead tribe immediately responded respectfully!<br/><br/>They didn’t dare to be presumptuous in front of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace who came from the nine-origin universe!<br/><br/>So what if the Black Earth tribe could kill the peak-stage master of the Black Earth tribe?<br/><br/>This master had even killed an existence in the Heavenly Yuan realm just now.<br/><br/>Their hearts were beating violently as they spoke to him carefully!<br/><br/>The three experts of the dead tribe immediately sent a message to the undead through their special method!<br/><br/>In the sky, the undead received the message from his subordinate. His eyes were sparkling.<br/><br/>He had thought of today’s situation.<br/><br/>However, he didn’t expect Wang Xian to exist.<br/><br/>He didn’t expect that there was a powerhouse in the Heaven’s origin realm from another universe who didn’t take away the ultimate treasure of the<br/><br/>Heaven’s origin realm. Instead, he helped the young man who had the ultimate<br/><br/>Heaven’s origin realm. Instead, he helped the young man who had the ultimate<br/><br/>treasure of the Heaven’s origin realm to grow up. Instead, he protected him.<br/><br/>This was something he had never thought of!<br/><br/>But the current situation, this kind of situation, was a good thing for their six paths universe!<br/><br/>The heavenly creation true treasure belonged to the disciples of their six paths universe, and it would always belong to their six paths universe!<br/><br/>The only pity was that they did not obtain the heavenly creation true treasure!<br/><br/>If today was not such a situation, even if the heavenly creation true treasure belonged to the disciples of their six paths universe, he would have ordered them to hand it over.<br/><br/>He would have even killed him and taken the Heavenly Yuan Creation Treasure!<br/><br/>But now, the situation was different!<br/><br/>Moreover, he guessed that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace must have a backup plan. Otherwise, he would have taken the young man away!<br/><br/>“What a lucky young man. He was born to be a heavenly yuan creation realm powerhouse.<br/><br/>He was a little envious, he immediately transmitted his voice, “Tell the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace that his foster son, Mu Litianci, is a disciple of the six paths universe and also our disciple. The Heavenly Yuan Creation Treasure was born to him and will be his in the future. We will protect him and help him grow to the heavenly yuan creation realm. We will repay him generously in the future!<br/><br/>“Lord Dragon King, our Lord of the dead has said that Mu Litianci is a disciple of our six paths universe. He is the disciple of the Lord of the dead. The Ultimate Treasure of Tianyuan belongs to him. In the future, we will protect him and help him grow to the Tianyuan realm. We will repay you generously!<br/><br/>The three powerful warriors of the dead tribe reported to Wang Xian in shock!<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, all the powerful disciples of the tribe were shocked when they heard the words of the tribe of the dead! They looked at tianci in unison as their eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>What did this sentence mean?<br/><br/>It meant that Mu Li Tianci would be one of the powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin creation in their six paths universe in the future.<br/><br/>He would be one of the top powerhouses in their universe!<br/><br/>He would be an existence that they had to kneel down to!<br/><br/>“Hehe, I don’t care about the promises of your six paths universe. If you have any evil intentions, I will destroy all the living beings in your six paths universe and let the undead resist as many as they can. The current situation is still under control. Furthermore, Tianci has exposed himself because of the incident with the Xuan Tu tribe. Give me an explanation! Wang Xian smiled faintly and continued to speak to them!<br/><br/>The current situation was still under control!<br/><br/>As for the other six universes, Wang Xian was not very worried.<br/><br/>Not to mention that Tianci could be resurrected if he died.<br/><br/>In the future, as long as he revealed his strength, he would not dare to make any moves against tianci!<br/><br/>If they dared to make any moves against him, with the power of the Dragon Palace, they would be able to wipe out all the living beings in the six universes in the future.<br/><br/>In fact, as long as Wang Xian was given some time, he would be able to wipe out all the living beings in the six paths of the universe!<br/><br/>This was his confidence!<br/><br/>When the three experts from the tribe of the dead heard Wang Xian’s words, cold sweat broke out on their foreheads!<br/><br/>Talking to such an expert who was so powerful that he could wipe out all the living beings in the universe made them a little fearful!<br/><br/>They nodded and immediately passed the message to the undead.<br/><br/>When the undead heard Wang Xian’s message, he raised his eyebrows slightly.<br/><br/>He didn’t doubt whether Wang Xian was bluffing or not.<br/><br/>He knew that this was a powerful universe with existences at the level of Great Dao in the nine origin universe.<br/><br/>It was completely incomparable to their six paths universe!<br/><br/>The other party might really have the ability to cause the lives of the living beings in their six paths universe to be in dire straits!<br/><br/>He wasn’t angry at this threat at all.<br/><br/>The other party wanted their six paths universe’s disciple to become a heavenly fate powerhouse and possess a heavenly fate treasure, even if this disciple was his foster son.<br/><br/>But he was still a member of their six paths universe.<br/><br/>His root was ultimately in the six paths universe!<br/><br/>This was an extremely lucky thing for the entire universe.<br/><br/>This was enough!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
