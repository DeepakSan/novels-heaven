Go<br/><br/>The place that the Dragon Palace occupied had the saint rebirth tablet.<br/><br/>The Saint Rebirth tablet could resurrect dead creatures!<br/><br/>The Sky Plant Demonic Beast clan should have a similar paradise!<br/><br/>He looked at the waterfall and sneered!<br/><br/>Although all the peak experts of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast clan were killed, they were also resurrected!<br/><br/>As long as they were given sufficient resources, they would be able to return to their peak state again!<br/><br/>“It’s not that easy to resurrect!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved and immediately flew towards the waterfall.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>The waterfall was extremely high and the depth of the water flow was extremely terrifying!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian flew over, the waterfall flowed backwards. The waterfall technique that was accumulated underneath was rapidly flowing towards the surroundings!<br/><br/>The water flow under the waterfall was flowing rapidly to the surroundings!<br/><br/>Very soon, there were no water stains at the bottom of the waterfall!<br/><br/>At the deepest part of the waterfall, there was a cave entrance at the lower half of the waist.<br/><br/>The cave entrance was about a thousand meters wide and was covered by a surge of energy!<br/><br/>However, at this moment, there were more than thirty races in the cave entrance!<br/><br/>Those seeds were emitting a luster. Above the races, there were illusory shadows floating in the air!<br/><br/>The illusory figures were flickering, and at the very front, the illusory figure was absorbing all kinds of energy to recover its incredibly weak body!<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>At this moment, the illusory figure at the very front noticed the change in the waterfall, and his expression changed slightly!<br/><br/>“Clan leader, we’ve been discovered!”<br/><br/>At the back, the illusory figures also sensed it, and their expressions changed greatly as they spoke!<br/><br/>“Even if we are discovered, the defense of our grotto-heaven paradise will not be able to break through the defense without the offensive power of a universe overlord!”<br/><br/>Before the tribe leader could speak, a phantoms at the side spoke in a deep voice!<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>At the front, the tribe leader of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast tribe waved his arm and a universe AI flew towards him!<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian’s figure appeared in everyone’s line of sight!<br/><br/>“I really didn’t expect that your sky-plant Demonic Beasts clan would have such a precious land. To think that you could resurrect so many creatures!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian came to the front of their sky-plant Demonic Beasts’paradise. Through the Azure Energy Shield, he could see more than 30 phantoms inside!<br/><br/>Below these phantoms were seeds!<br/><br/>Obviously, this was their way of resurrection!<br/><br/>However, they seemed to be abnormally weak.<br/><br/>“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, how dare you exterminate our Sky-plant Demonic Beast Clan? The Lords of our Angel clan will not let you off. Just wait for Your Demise!”<br/><br/>The Phantoms of the sky-plant Demonic Beast clan trembled and roared with a cold face!<br/><br/>“Hehe!”<br/><br/>Upon hearing his words, Wang Xian sneered, “The first to perish will be your sky-plant Demonic Beasts!”<br/><br/>“Hahaha, you want to destroy us? As long as we are still around, the sky-plant demonic beasts will not perish. You Are Dreaming if you want to destroy us!”<br/><br/>The leader of the sky-plant Demonic Beasts roared with a ferocious expression!<br/><br/>Although their sky-plant demonic beasts had been destroyed, they were not dead yet!<br/><br/>As long as they were not dead, the sky-plant demonic beasts would be able to return to their peak!<br/><br/>However, this time, it was a huge blow to the sky-plant demonic beasts!<br/><br/>Countless powerful disciples and countless resources had been plundered by the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>Only when the Dragon Palace was destroyed would they be able to vent their hatred!<br/><br/>“Hehe, wishful thinking? Sky-plant demonic beasts, this is the price you have to pay to deal with our Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements millstone appeared in his hand.<br/><br/>He injected energy into the millstone and smashed it towards the defensive barrier in front of him!<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>A terrifying collision sound was heard. However, the attack of the five elements millstone did not break through the defense of the light barrier!<br/><br/>This made him raise his eyebrows slightly!<br/><br/>“You can’t break through the defense of our grotto-heaven paradise. I will watch as your Dragon Palace is destroyed!”<br/><br/>The leader of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast roared ferociously when he saw that the grotto-heaven paradise was able to easily withstand Wang Xian’s attack!<br/><br/>He opened the universe’s AI and immediately reported the situation on their side to the experts of the Angel Race and the Holy Dragon lineage!<br/><br/>This time, they were exterminated by the Dragon Palace because of the Holy Dragon lineage!<br/><br/>Naturally, they had to come and help them out!<br/><br/>“Hehe, do you really think that I can’t do anything to You?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian revealed a mocking expression as he looked up into the sky!<br/><br/>“Dragon King!”<br/><br/>An Lie’s figure appeared beside Wang Xian. He looked at the blessed land in front of him.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>An lie nodded and his figure disappeared instantly.<br/><br/>In the next moment, his figure disappeared and reappeared beside the leader of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast tribe!<br/><br/>“Hi, everyone, I’m in!”<br/><br/>An lie, who had entered, looked at them and greeted them with a smile!<br/><br/>At this moment, the leader of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast tribe and the rest, who were filled with hatred and anger, were staring at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>When they suddenly saw an lie enter, they were stunned!<br/><br/>What was going on?<br/><br/>How did he get in?<br/><br/>What the hell was going on?<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>An lie quickly set up a demonic altar and disappeared. He came to Wang Xian’s side!<br/><br/>Soon, while they were still in a daze, an lie brought Wang Xian in!<br/><br/>“I’m in again!”<br/><br/>An lie continued with a smile on his face!<br/><br/>“You, you, you…”<br/><br/>The leader of the sky-planting demonic beasts and the rest looked at an lie who came in again. Looking at Wang Xian who came in, their bodies trembled violently!<br/><br/>“I will let your sky-planting Demonic Beast Race Perish First!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at them and said with a face full of mockery!<br/><br/>“Soul Catcher!”<br/><br/>He waved his arm and performed soul catcher directly at the leader of the sky-planting demonic beast race.<br/><br/>The leader of the sky-planting demonic beast race, whose strength had dropped drastically, flashed and entered Wang Xian’s body directly!<br/><br/>All the information about him was transmitted into Wang Xian’s mind!<br/><br/>“No, no, no, give us a chance. We are willing to submit. We are willing. Don’t Kill Us!”<br/><br/>At this moment, all the experts of the sky-planting demonic beast race had completely collapsed!<br/><br/>When they were killed just now, they knew that they still had a chance to revive!<br/><br/>But now, once they died, they would really die!<br/><br/>They didn’t want to die!<br/><br/>The group of heaven-planted demonic beasts wanted to beg for mercy!<br/><br/>“What’s the use of having you guys?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them with disdain as he cast the soul capturing spell one by one!<br/><br/>Very soon, more than thirty shadows dissipated. This also meant that the heaven-planted demonic beasts were completely annihilated!<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and a surge of energy landed on the ground. The protective shield in front of him slowly disappeared!<br/><br/>He looked at a stone tree in the middle!<br/><br/>This stone tree was connected to the ground and was the core of this blessed land!<br/><br/>There were more than a dozen dazzling races on the stone tree. As long as the blood essence was injected into these seeds, they could be resurrected through these races after they died!<br/><br/>Wang Xian walked over to take a look. After confirming that he couldn’t take it away, he moved his body and flew to the side.<br/><br/>Here we go!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
