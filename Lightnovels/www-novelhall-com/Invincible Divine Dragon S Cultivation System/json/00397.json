About 100 million kilometers to the right of Wang Xian’s figure, over a hundred thundermale apes were directly destroyed by him.<br/><br/>Thundermale apes were a type of dire beast in the Thundercloud region. They were good at team battles.<br/><br/>There were more than a hundred thunder male apes. All of them were at the seventh level of the Universe Knight Realm.<br/><br/>However, they had attacked the wrong target this time.<br/><br/>“You’re courting death.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said coldly. With a move of his arm, he kept all the corpses.<br/><br/>“No wonder it’s said that the interior of the Thundercloud is more dangerous. We can’t be careless!”<br/><br/>His body moved. After a moment of hesitation, he flew downwards and landed on the ground.<br/><br/>The thunderclouds were connected to the ground. It was possible that there were dire beasts underground.<br/><br/>By landing on the ground, he could be more alert of his surroundings.<br/><br/>He kept flying forward. After a short while, Wang Xian arrived in front of a mountain peak under the sensing of the incipient saint wings.<br/><br/>The mountain peak was not tall. It was only a few tens of thousands of meters. However, there was a lightning pillar that was connected to the peak.<br/><br/>At the top of the mountain peak, there was a lightning tree. The entire tree was emitting a powerful energy.<br/><br/>“Tsk Tsk, a universe knight level nine lightning tree. This is a treasure!”<br/><br/>His eyes were sparkling as he sensed his surroundings.<br/><br/>There should be a desolate beast guarding the lightning tree.<br/><br/>However, after sensing for a while, he did not find any desolate beasts.<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s body moved and landed at the peak of the mountain, beside the Thunder Tree.<br/><br/>He scanned the surroundings and reached out his hand to grab it.<br/><br/>The moment he made his move, the mountain below suddenly erupted with a terrifying attack power.<br/><br/>A palm condensed from huge rocks was smacked toward Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“What? A peak with the combat strength of a universe knight level nine?”<br/><br/>He immediately changed his form slightly. His arm turned into a dragon claw. He clenched it and smashed it towards the peak.<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>The huge force of the collision caused the arm of the peak to collapse instantly.<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>An angry roar came from within the peak. In the next moment, countless huge rocks containing terrifying thunderbolts smashed towards Wang Xian like meteorites.<br/><br/>“You’re courting death!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian let out a furious roar. Gusts of wind that contained the power of Thunderbolts appeared on the uninitiated holy wings on his back.<br/><br/>The hurricane headed straight for the entire mountain peak.<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>The huge rocks that resembled meteorites collapsed instantly and scattered in all directions.<br/><br/>However, when the huge Thunderbolts attacked Wang Xian, the huge mountain peak began to turn illusory.<br/><br/>It was already prepared to escape.<br/><br/>“It’s Too Late!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s gaze was locked onto the desolate beast on the mountain peak. His eyes revealed a cold expression.<br/><br/>At such a close distance, it was impossible for him to escape.<br/><br/>“Bang, Bang, Bang!”<br/><br/>In an instant, Wang Xian arrived in front of the body that was about to disappear. Streams of destructive power of the five elements blasted into it.<br/><br/>“Roar, Roar!”<br/><br/>A terrifying roar was heard. Wang Xian swung his body and a phantom image of a divine dragon’s tail charged out.<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>Cracks appeared on the body of the entire mountain desolate beast. Its vitality gradually disappeared.<br/><br/>“This ability to hide its aura is really powerful. Even I can’t sense it.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the dead mountain desolate beast and muttered.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>At this moment, he saw purple lightning essence flowing out from the crack of the mountain desolate beast.<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his hand and all the purple liquid landed in front of him.<br/><br/>“What a majestic power of lightning. I can absorb it directly. Not Bad!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and kept it away. Then, he looked at the lightning tree above.<br/><br/>He flew over and kept it in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“There are so many treasures here. Let’s continue!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued flying forward.<br/><br/>In the next month, he found a lot of treasures. He also caught hundreds of dire beasts.<br/><br/>“Eh, there’s a huge tree in front of us. What a strong power of lightning!”<br/><br/>On this day, Wang Xian was flying in the thunderclouds when he suddenly saw a huge purple tree.<br/><br/>The huge tree was bathed in the lightning and looked exceptionally divine.<br/><br/>His eyes were glowing and he immediately approached it.<br/><br/>“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”<br/><br/>Before he could approach it, a familiar chirping sound was heard.<br/><br/>“Thundercloud Vulture!”<br/><br/>He narrowed his eyes slightly and concealed his figure as he continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”<br/><br/>“Crackle crackle!”<br/><br/>Just as he flew over, an inescapable net covered him.<br/><br/>The Lightning Net formed from the lightning emitted a terrifying aura.<br/><br/>This made Wang Xian slightly shocked. He was actually discovered.<br/><br/>“The desolate beasts inside the thunderclouds are really powerful. The desolate beasts on the mountain peaks that I can’t sense are able to discover my Thundercloud Vultures. Furthermore, they have prepared an inescapable net to attack me!”<br/><br/>He thought to himself as he flapped the prieless holy wings on his back.<br/><br/>Waves of wind and thunder energy surged towards the surroundings. The net of heavenly thunder that covered him dissipated immediately.<br/><br/>“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a rapid chirping sound was heard. A Thunder Cross was heading towards Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“The attack of a level nine universe knight, Thundercloud Vultures!”<br/><br/>“There are still two of them!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze forward. His eyes revealed a cold expression. With a move of his palm, the five elements Grindstone flew out and went straight for the Thunder Cross.<br/><br/>“Peng!”<br/><br/>The five elements grindstone flew over and the entire thunder cross collapsed.<br/><br/>“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”<br/><br/>The two level 9 universe Knights Thundercloud Vultures revealed a fearful and fearful expression when they saw this scene. They hurriedly flew towards the thunder tree in the distance.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian saw them flying onto the tree. He narrowed his eyes slightly and moved his body. He immediately chased after them.<br/><br/>“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”<br/><br/>The two Thunder Cloud Vultures that landed on the tree raised their heads and let out a hurried sound. The surrounding densely packed thunder cloud vultures flew towards the purple tree.<br/><br/>“So Many?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze over and was slightly stunned.<br/><br/>There were a total of seven to eight hundred Thunder Cloud Vultures standing on the purple tree. Their eyes were filled with killing intent as they stared at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>From A Level One universe knight to a level nine universe knight, they had everything.<br/><br/>“Whoosh!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes glowed as he arrived in front of the purple tree in an instant.<br/><br/>“Buzz!”<br/><br/>The moment he stepped into the purple tree, a purple lightning barrier enveloped the tree completely.<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s body collided with the tree, producing a loud sound.<br/><br/>The Lightning Shield did not move at all.<br/><br/>“What is this?”<br/><br/>He raised his eyebrows as his palm landed heavily on the shield.<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>A tremendous rebounding force came over, causing his expression to change slightly as he flew backward.<br/><br/>“Paradise, a defensive paradise with rebounding force!”<br/><br/>His expression changed slightly as he frowned.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
