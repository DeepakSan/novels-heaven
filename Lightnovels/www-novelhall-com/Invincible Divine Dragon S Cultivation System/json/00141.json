The nine swords race is capturing Yalong around the volcano region. Are they going to make an enemy of the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>“The nine swords race has been hunting yalong. This information is really possible.”<br/><br/>“Hiss, if it’s true, will the Dragon Palace start a war with the nine-sword race?”<br/><br/>“Every primary race in the universe will start a war. The Dragon Palace might really start a war with the nine-sword race.”<br/><br/>On the universe’s AI, countless people were discussing in shock.<br/><br/>At the same time, on a slightly backward planet beside the Milky Way, in a small village, a woman was walking anxiously in the courtyard. Her face was filled with anxiety and uneasiness.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian’s heaven formation and the rest appeared above them. They looked at the woman.<br/><br/>“Hello, I’m the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest landed in front of the woman and said plainly.<br/><br/>“Ah!”<br/><br/>When she saw Wang Xian who had suddenly appeared, she was shocked. She sized them up and immediately knelt down. “I beg the Dragon King to save my brother. My brother has been taken away.”<br/><br/>“Get up.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the girl and sighed. He waved his arm and helped her to stand up.<br/><br/>“What’s Your Name?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, my name is Jiao Jiao. My brother is Jiao Long.”<br/><br/>The girl stood up and said.<br/><br/>“You have the items on your brother, right? Give me the items and I’ll check his location.”<br/><br/>Sky Array said.<br/><br/>“Don’t worry, we will help you find your brother.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian promised from the side.<br/><br/>Even if he died, the Dragon Palace would be able to save him.<br/><br/>“Thank you, Dragon King! Thank you, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Jiao jiao thanked him immediately, “Brother’s divine kingdom is over here. I will bring you there.”<br/><br/>“The Divine Kingdom is better.”<br/><br/>Sky array nodded. Soon, Wang Xian and the rest followed Jiao Jiao into his brother’s divine kingdom.<br/><br/>The sky array waved its arm and began to set up the formation.<br/><br/>Beside them, Jiao Jiao could sense the terrifying power of the sky array. Her eyes were filled with anticipation.<br/><br/>After the Dragon Palace had completely exterminated the remnant citizens of the Mohan clan, the sky array had obtained all the witchcraft of the Mohan clan.<br/><br/>His current witchcraft foundation was not weak at all.<br/><br/>As the formation was set up, an image was quickly transmitted over. In the image, a young man who was imprisoned appeared.<br/><br/>Around the young man.<br/><br/>“Can you lock onto his location?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked from the side.<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace is a little troublesome. He should be in a secret place that the formation can’t detect.”<br/><br/>“Even with my strength, I can’t detect it. There are only a few primary races in the universe.”<br/><br/>The heaven formation frowned slightly and said.<br/><br/>His words made Jiao Jiao’s face turn pale.<br/><br/>“Can you lock onto their approximate range?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked.<br/><br/>“Let me try!”<br/><br/>Tian Chen focused his gaze and a black book appeared in his hand. The words floated in the air and he began to assemble them.<br/><br/>Finally, a blurry image appeared.<br/><br/>The image was very blurry. Tian Chen’s eyes flickered. “There is only a weak image. We sent the image to Prime Minister Gui and asked him to send someone to look for it. It shouldn’t take long to find it.”<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head and looked at Jiao Jiao. “Don’t worry. The Dragon Palace will rescue your brother safely. Follow us to the Dragon Palace first.”<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King.”<br/><br/>Jiao Jiao nodded her head heavily. Wang Xian waved his arm and kept her into the mother nest. The few of them moved and disappeared instantly. They returned to the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, there’s new news on the AI. It seems that an inferior dragon powerhouse sent a message on the AI. He said that he was attacked by the nine-sword race when he arrived at the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian and the rest arrived, Prime Minister GUI came over to report.<br/><br/>“The nine-sword race?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian narrowed his eyes. Killing intent flashed in his eyes.<br/><br/>“Prime Minister Gui, help her settle down.”<br/><br/>He waved his arm and let Jiao Jiao out.<br/><br/>Jiao Jiao looked at the surrounding Dragon Palace and opened her mouth slightly.<br/><br/>“Don’t worry about your brother. We will rescue him in the next few days. You should rest in the Dragon Palace now.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui said to her.<br/><br/>“Thank you, thank you!”<br/><br/>Jiao Jiao nodded.<br/><br/>“Sky Array, call all the universe knights in the Dragon Palace. We will go to the volcano region to investigate. I want to see if it is nine swords and the dragon descendants.”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, he flew out.<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>Very soon, all the universe knights in the Dragon Palace flew out. Their eyes were filled with killing intent.<br/><br/>In the Dragon Palace, Jiao Jiao saw so many universe knights in the Dragon Palace. She opened her mouth slightly and revealed a shocked expression.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, they actually dared to capture the inferior dragons around our Dragon Palace. They dare to look down on our Dragon Palace. We will start a war with them. I want to see who will kill who?”<br/><br/>After flying out of the Dragon Palace, the leaders of the Dragon Palace growled in a low voice with a murderous look on their faces.<br/><br/>“Save those inferior dragons first.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said coldly and flew quickly toward the outer area of the volcano region.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>When he arrived at the edge of the volcano region, Wang Xian waved his arm. The crescent moon was suspended in the sky as he observed the situation over here.<br/><br/>At the same time, at the bottom of the Milky Way, a group of middle-aged elders were seated on a ship.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the eyes of the middle-aged elder focused as he stared at the glowing red ball in front of him.<br/><br/>“Someone is investigating our situation.”<br/><br/>He stood up and said immediately.<br/><br/>“It should be the Dragon Palace. Right now, there’s a ya long in the universe AI that has spread the news. Get Ready, we’ll investigate the strength of the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>The old man in the center said.<br/><br/>“Send the news to the dragon race.”<br/><br/>An old man beside him said.<br/><br/>They were all universe knights of the nine-blade race. This time, their target was the inferior dragon, and they wanted to test the power of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“It’s a pity to be discovered so early, I still want to hunt more inferior dragons.”<br/><br/>The nine-blade universe knight on the right shook his head and said with disappointment.<br/><br/>“Haha, as long as we can destroy that Dragon Palace, we will still need inferior dragons?”<br/><br/>The two universe knights of the nine blade race beside them laughed eerily.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
