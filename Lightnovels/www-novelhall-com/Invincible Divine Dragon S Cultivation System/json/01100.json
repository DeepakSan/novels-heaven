They had all kinds of appearances and contained all kinds of powerful attributes.<br/><br/>To the creatures and powerhouses of the six paths universe, hunting elemental beasts would greatly increase their strength.<br/><br/>However, in the sacred land, the elemental beasts did not go extinct. Instead, many elemental beasts occupied a territory.<br/><br/>This was because one of the powerhouses of the heavenly fate realm in the six paths universe was an elemental beast.<br/><br/>The elemental beasts that broke through to the heavenly fate realm gave birth to intelligence.<br/><br/>He was naturally unwilling to let the intelligent beings in the six paths universe exterminate their race.<br/><br/>Even the other two Heaven Creation Realm Masters gave orders that disciples at the peak of the universe master realm were prohibited from hunting elemental beasts.<br/><br/>This also caused many places in the six great holy lands to be a paradise for elemental beasts!<br/><br/>“There are three Heaven Creation Realm Masters in the six paths universe. They are metal-type earth-type and death-type. Generally speaking, a heaven creation realm master that can give birth to six elements in the six paths universe can also give birth to a heaven creation realm treasure with six elements. ”<br/><br/>“However, whether or not they can give birth to a heaven-type ultimate treasure is also related to the energy in the universe. I think the possibility of the other three attributes is higher. Let’s go to the Huo Yuan first. Let’s check out the three holy lands of fire, water, and Earth First. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian analyzed.<br/><br/>Lin Niu nodded his head and looked to the right. “Boss, the Huo Yuan is on the right. ”<br/><br/>“Alright, let’s go. We’ll head to the fire field first.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head.<br/><br/>After flying for a long time, they had arrived at the depths of the six paths universe.<br/><br/>They were not too far away from the fire field.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and Lin Niu continued flying. Before long, a fire field appeared in their sight.<br/><br/>The fire field, the real fire field.<br/><br/>The Great Fire Field.<br/><br/>In the fire field, wisps of flames rose from the ground. Each wisp of flame was of different sizes.<br/><br/>The tall and Big Flame shot straight to the clouds. It contained a terrifying power and swayed in the air.<br/><br/>The small flame was only half a meter tall.<br/><br/>It created a strange and magnificent scene in front of them.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest sized up this special space and entered it immediately.<br/><br/>“Let’s sense it a little. This is the only way.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said as he looked at Lin Niu. “Lin Niu, let’s each sense a territory. Be careful and don’t be discovered.”<br/><br/>“Yes, Boss!”<br/><br/>Lin Niu nodded.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and Lin Niu started to separate. They could sense each other’s auras and ensure that they wouldn’t get lost.<br/><br/>This way, the two of them could search faster.<br/><br/>It was extremely difficult to search for an unknown treasure in an unfamiliar universe.<br/><br/>It could even be said to be searching for a needle in a haystack.<br/><br/>However, the temptation of the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin was too great. Even if they would waste hundreds of millions of years, they would still be willing to do so.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest also had the same thought.<br/><br/>The fire plains was the land of fire, the land of fire attribute.<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved forward bit by bit and sensed.<br/><br/>A few months later, some living beings from the six paths of the universe appeared in the surroundings.<br/><br/>The strong disciples who were located in the tribe of the fire plains.<br/><br/>These strong disciples seemed to be searching for something as they searched bit by bit.<br/><br/>“The strongest ruler of the universe at level three. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the thousands of strong disciples as he muttered.<br/><br/>His body moved and he walked over immediately. The soul-absorbing power started to be activated silently.<br/><br/>Very soon, information was transmitted into his mind.<br/><br/>“Earth Fire Tribe. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian muttered.<br/><br/>Earth Fire Tribe was the name of the tribe of these thousands of strong disciples.<br/><br/>The tribe leader gave an order for them to search for items that contained supernatural energy and pressure.<br/><br/>In fact, they did not know what they were looking for.<br/><br/>They were only relying on a little bit of information to search blindly.<br/><br/>“It seems that the powerhouses in the six paths of the universe do not know about the condition of the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself.<br/><br/>If that was the case, their chances would be higher!<br/><br/>After Wang Xian received some useful information, he continued to move forward.<br/><br/>However, in the fire plains, other than the flames and the occasional encounters with the strong disciples of the six paths universe tribes and some elemental beasts, Wang Xian and the rest did not find any information about the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Wang Xian was mentally prepared and did not lose his patience.<br/><br/>A few hundred years later, Wang Xian and the Unicorn ox arrived at the front of a tribe.<br/><br/>This was an extremely huge tribe.<br/><br/>On the periphery of the tribe, there were buildings that were emitting flames.<br/><br/>“Let’s go to this ao Huo tribe and see if we can get some information. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian gestured to Lin Niu.<br/><br/>After searching for a few hundred years, Wang Xian and the rest didn ‘t get any clues. He was prepared to continue to this place and search the memories of the strong disciples here.<br/><br/>He wanted to see if he could find anything.<br/><br/>After all, this was the territory of the tribes in the six paths universe. Ever since the news of the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan came out, the tribes had been searching.<br/><br/>They had been searching for at least tens of millions of years.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest disguised themselves as creatures from the six paths universe. Their bodies were emitting flames as they walked in.<br/><br/>There were a large number of humans at the periphery of the Ao Huo tribe. It was very lively here.<br/><br/>Wang Xian entered the tribe and sensed the aura of the people around him. He began to search the memories of some masters in the ruler realm silently. There were not many masters at the periphery of the tribe, but there were more than a dozen of them.<br/><br/>Wang Xian frowned slightly as he checked the news one by one.<br/><br/>There was no information at all.<br/><br/>Looks like I have to make a long-term plan in this universe<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself. Then, he walked towards a restaurant. He was prepared to stay at the periphery of this tribe for a little longer.<br/><br/>Damn those fellows from the nine-origin universe. They actually used that strange sorcery to expose King Kong’s identity. They were discovered by the Heaven’s origin creator in this universe and used them to kill King Kong. Now that King Kong has left the six-origin universe, he needs to recover for a short period of time and can not enter<br/><br/>“Those 12 ancestral warlocks are a little difficult to deal with. If they’re here, the other fellows from the 9 -essences universe might be here too. Once we encounter them, we’ll directly slaughter them. ”<br/><br/>“In this universe, unless we encounter the Thunder Emperor and the rest of the nine-essences universe’s royal family of angels, we won’t have much of an advantage here. After all, this universe doesn’t have any spatial attributes. ”<br/><br/>“We also have a great advantage. If we launch a sneak attack and leave without success, they won’t be able to catch up to us. Moreover, when the time comes, we will attract the heavenly yuan fortune of this universe. We will use this method to deal with them, HMPH! ”<br/><br/>“HMM? I seem to have sensed a special aura.”<br/><br/>At the same time, two figures were conversing with each other through voice transmission from the outer area of the Ao Huo tribe. Suddenly, one of the figures raised an eyebrow..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
