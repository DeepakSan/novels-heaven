Attack!<br/><br/>Translator: 549690339<br/><br/>“Those who believe in the mighty gods will gain eternal life!”<br/><br/>“Those who believe in the mighty gods will gain eternal life! ”<br/><br/>The Voice of faith entered the minds of the disciples of the Twelve Peak races.<br/><br/>This vast voice made their bodies stiffen, and their eyes became dull. Their faces were filled with shock.<br/><br/>Their faces revealed a look of struggle.<br/><br/>“Weng Weng Weng! ”<br/><br/>The demon race’s expert’s wings emitted a pitch-black light that slowly enveloped him.<br/><br/>Quickly escape!<br/><br/>After breaking free from this comfortable feeling, he hurriedly shouted loudly!<br/><br/>“Boom Boom Boom! ”<br/><br/>“Boom Boom Boom! ”<br/><br/>However, just as he finished speaking, waves of terrifying pressure surged towards them.<br/><br/>This terrifying pressure made all of them hold their breaths.<br/><br/>“Oh no, eight legions. It’s actually the eight legions of the belief universe. ”<br/><br/>The expression of the devil race expert changed drastically when he saw this scene.<br/><br/>He spread his devil wings and immediately fled into the distance.<br/><br/>At this time, he could no longer care about the others.<br/><br/>At this moment, a few of the underworld race experts and a few of the wizard race experts regained their clarity.<br/><br/>Seeing the Army of faith that was attacking them, despair appeared on their faces.<br/><br/>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! ”<br/><br/>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! ”<br/><br/>Waves of terrifying power were already suppressing them.<br/><br/>“We can’t escape!”<br/><br/>A rank 7 nether race expert saw this scene and his heart trembled violently.<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>Energy swept towards them.<br/><br/>The rest of the experts reacted, but it was too late!<br/><br/>“It’s over, we can’t escape!” “How did they know where we are? How did they lock onto us?”<br/><br/>“Eight legions, we can’t escape! ”<br/><br/>The 500 or so experts of the belief universe recovered, their hearts sinking.<br/><br/>They were doomed!<br/><br/>The 500 or so experts of the 12 peak races faced the eight legions, tens of millions of gods, and believers. At such a close distance, they couldn’t resist.<br/><br/>The terrifying power of faith instantly drowned them all!<br/><br/>Their life force instantly vanished!<br/><br/>Only one level 7 devil race expert escaped because he had a treasure.<br/><br/>The rest all died.<br/><br/>Only those who had a true treasure could be resurrected.<br/><br/>“He actually let one escape?”<br/><br/>“Hehe, it doesn’t matter if one escapes. The harvest this time isn’t bad! ”<br/><br/>“Indeed, it’s still alright! ”<br/><br/>At this time, the gods from the eight legions flew over, the corners of their mouths curling up slightly.<br/><br/>Nine origin universe, five battle teams formed by the Twelve Pinnacle races. Each battle team’s strength wasn’t weak, but they weren’t too strong either.<br/><br/>At most, all of their trump cards could be used to fight against an army from the belief universe.<br/><br/>But facing the combined forces of eight legions, it was still not enough.<br/><br/>He could be easily killed.<br/><br/>“Weng Weng! ”<br/><br/>“On the other side, they have also destroyed that small team!”<br/><br/>At this time, a level 7 pantheon in the center suddenly took out his communication device to take a look. The corners of his mouth curled up as he said with a smile.<br/><br/>“Oh? That’s not bad! ”<br/><br/>“Next, we should prepare to attack the 9-origin universe’s space city. Let’s see what this space city can do.”<br/><br/>“Let’s go. We’ll meet up with the other legions! ”<br/><br/>The seven gods of the eight palaces said. They smiled and flew in one direction to meet up with the other 12 legions!<br/><br/>More than 1,000 warriors of the two battle teams died one after another. This news immediately spread to the 12 pinnacle races.<br/><br/>When the Pinnacle Race Warriors received this news, their expressions instantly became ugly.<br/><br/>Out of the 12 peak races, each battle team had around 50 of their experts. The level 6 and Level 7 rulers were already the high-level combat strength of each peak race!<br/><br/>But now, in a short period of time, more than 100 had died!<br/><br/>In addition to the trump cards in their hands.<br/><br/>One had to know that the 5 battle teams formed by the 12 peak races were all peak existences at the level of each peak race.<br/><br/>All of them had some powerful treasures in their hands.<br/><br/>Now, all of them were dead!<br/><br/>This loss was not insignificant!<br/><br/>Even the great battle between the Angel Race and the Phoenix race against Wang Xian was not as disastrous as this one.<br/><br/>“Let the other three battle teams return to the Giant Star City first. We won’t take any action for now. Also, let them pay attention to the situation in the Giant Star City. ”<br/><br/>The witch clan’s ancestor Wu frowned and said!<br/><br/>The other peak races nodded.<br/><br/>“Phoenix clan, have you contacted the star beasts in the depths of the starry universe?”<br/><br/>On the Angel clan’s side, the Radiant Angel King asked the Phoenix clan’s Water Phoenix King.<br/><br/>“We’ve already sent experts over. We’re not sure yet!”<br/><br/>The Water Phoenix King replied.<br/><br/>“The strength of the belief universe is still too strong, at our level, we’re not their match. ”<br/><br/>The Great Elf of the elf race frowned slightly and said.<br/><br/>“Let’s wait and see, with the space city here, we don’t need to worry too much. ”<br/><br/>“Let’s slowly waste our time with them!”<br/><br/>Several Pinnacle Race Warriors said, their brows also locked.<br/><br/>It was unknown which pinnacle race’s great beings had suddenly revealed the news of two battle teams being killed by the Faith Universe Army.<br/><br/>The moment this news was released, it caused a huge sensation within the faith universe.<br/><br/>“What’s going on? Two armies formed by twelve pinnacle races were actually killed? This… how is this possible?”<br/><br/>“Is the Faith Universe Army So Strong?”<br/><br/>“We don’t seem to be a match for the belief universe gods. Damn it, how can they be so strong?”<br/><br/>“I heard that a battle team of more than 500 top-tier great beings, and these 500 top-tier great beings were all annihilated. This is too terrifying. You have to know that this is a battle team formed by the combined strength of 12 pinnacle races from our 9-origin universe.”<br/><br/>Countless great being disciples were discussing within the communication stone plate.<br/><br/>All of the expert disciples who saw this news were filled with shock.<br/><br/>When the group of peak races saw this news being transmitted to the communication stone plate, it caused a huge sensation, and they didn’t refute it.<br/><br/>In fact, the elven race even sent a message: if you fall behind or are weak, you have to take a beating and train hard!<br/><br/>The peak races tacitly agreed, and the elven race’s message once again caused everyone to be in an uproar.<br/><br/>Countless experts and disciples began to discuss.<br/><br/>Following that, they erupted with the slogan of attacking the belief universe and killing them.<br/><br/>“Hehe, killing us? Just based on your tiny 9-origin universe?”<br/><br/>The gods of the various palaces all had some believers in the 9-origin universe. After receiving the information on the 9 -origin universe communication stone plate, they revealed a trace of a cold smile. “Launch the attack on time in one month! ” The gods of the belief universe said coldly..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
