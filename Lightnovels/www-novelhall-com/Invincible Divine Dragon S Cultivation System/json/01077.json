They flew straight towards the center.<br/><br/>The closer they got to the center, the more terrifying the temperature became.<br/><br/>Both Wang Xian and Lin Niu possessed the fire attribute. Hence, they had a higher resistance to the fire attribute!<br/><br/>However, before Wang Xian and the rest could get close to the center, a violent sound suddenly came from the center!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian and the rest heard the sound, they were slightly stunned. A hint of shock appeared on their faces!<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>Boom! Boom<br/><br/>In the next moment, Wang Xian could feel the flames around him starting to become violent. They attacked Wang Xian and the rest directly.<br/><br/>Countless Flames came charging at them with a might that could threaten them!<br/><br/>“Boss, be careful! ”<br/><br/>Lin Niu’s expression changed drastically when he saw this scene. He immediately shouted at Wang Xian! “Boom! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. His body trembled as he activated the nine attributes in his body. All of them were converted into the fire attribute.<br/><br/>Terrifying Flames erupted from his entire body.<br/><br/>The power of the flames covered the area around him. A Ray of light bloomed from Lin Niu’s single horn. It enveloped him completely and was prepared to take the attack head-on.<br/><br/>Without seeing their opponent, they didn’t dare to launch an attack rashly!<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>However, what surprised Wang Xian the next second was that.<br/><br/>The flames that were attacking him suddenly stopped and attacked the unicorn!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this scene, he was slightly stunned!<br/><br/>On the other hand, the unicorn was covered in flames.<br/><br/>The powerful attack force caused him to fly backward!<br/><br/>Lin Niu let out a low roar. His gaze swept over Wang Xian’s side and he revealed a stunned expression.<br/><br/>“Boss, why aren’t you being attacked? Why am I the only one being attacked?”<br/><br/>Lin Niu shouted loudly! “Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>Just as he finished his sentence, countless flames started to brew in the surrounding area. The even more terrifying flames were aimed at Lin Niu.<br/><br/>Wang Xian, who was standing at the side, felt that the surrounding flames were extremely gentle!<br/><br/>“Boss, the attack of these flames is too fierce! ”<br/><br/>When the Linniu saw this scene, his expression changed again as he shouted at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly as well.<br/><br/>Why did this sea of Flames only attack the Linniu and not him?<br/><br/>“Could it be because I have the fire attribute?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself. He looked at the linniu and said, “Linniu, show me your fire attribute. ”<br/><br/>“Fire attribute?”<br/><br/>When the Linniu heard Wang Xian’s words, his heart skipped a beat. Waves of fire energy burst out from his body.<br/><br/>The Linniu had the fire attribute, the Thunder attribute and the darkness attribute.<br/><br/>His three attributes were not a perfect combination.<br/><br/>The reason why he could have three attributes was due to his physique.<br/><br/>His unique physique allowed him to possess the abilities of three attributes.<br/><br/>It was different from what Wang Xian possessed.<br/><br/>Terrifying Flames erupted from the body of the unicorn ox as it charged towards the surrounding flames!<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>Boom! Boom<br/><br/>However, the surrounding flames did not stop attacking because of the flames that erupted from the body of the Unicorn Ox. Instead, they continued to cover<br/><br/>the Sky and earth!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this scene, he frowned slightly.<br/><br/>What was going on? Was it not working?<br/><br/>(‘F * ck!”<br/><br/>When the LINNIU saw that the flames were still attacking him, he could not help but let out a low growl!<br/><br/>He quickly defended himself!<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>The terrifying collision began!<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian could feel that the temperature on this side was increasing rapidly.<br/><br/>He could feel a terrifying fire energy approaching from the center.<br/><br/>He focused his gaze.<br/><br/>The unicorn ox also sensed something. It looked at Wang Xian and said,<br/><br/>“Unicorn Ox, hide first!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and a wave of energy enveloped the unicorn ox.<br/><br/>The unicorn ox did not resist. Wang Xian kept it into the mother nest!<br/><br/>The next moment, when the unicorn ox disappeared, the Sea of fire around it stopped boiling!<br/><br/>It gradually regained its calmness once again!<br/><br/>Wang Xian floated there quietly and looked to the right.<br/><br/>That was the center of the Sea of fire.<br/><br/>He could sense that a powerful flame was approaching.<br/><br/>Wang Xian didn’t Dodge immediately.<br/><br/>The attack just now was obviously controlled by this flame. He wasn ‘t attacked. It must have triggered some special reason.<br/><br/>At that moment, he saw a white spark appear in his line of sight.<br/><br/>It was a flame that contained incomparable purity and brilliance.<br/><br/>White, a pale white spark!<br/><br/>In this world of fire, it was abnormally dazzling.<br/><br/>This white spark was like a real flower, extremely beautiful!<br/><br/>But it contained an incomparably enormous power of fire.<br/><br/>It seemed to be able to burn everything.<br/><br/>The surrounding chaotic space had been burned into a domain by it.<br/><br/>This white flame flower was only a hundred meters in size, but it was extremely dangerous!<br/><br/>“This flame flower is probably able to burn the fate of the Heaven’s origin!<br/><br/>His eyes were filled with vigilance.<br/><br/>If anything bad happened, he would be prepared to escape at any time!<br/><br/>This flame flower was very, very strong.<br/><br/>The white flame flower didn’t seem to have any intelligence. It stopped right before Wang Xian.<br/><br/>It seemed to have sensed that the intruder had disappeared!<br/><br/>Then, it continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at this flame flower and sized it up carefully. Then, he followed at the side!<br/><br/>The flame flower treated Wang Xian as if he didn ‘t exist and continued to wreak havoc.<br/><br/>It bloomed.<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew along for a period of time. His body moved and his huge body swayed as he flew towards the back of the flame flower.<br/><br/>After two days, he observed the entire territory covered by the flame flower.<br/><br/>The entire territory was huge and vast!<br/><br/>However, there was nothing substantial in this territory.<br/><br/>The only treasure in the entire Sea of fire territory was the white flame flower. This flame flower had no intelligence and was flying aimlessly.<br/><br/>“If I can subdue and use this flame flower, it would be amazing!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself.<br/><br/>However, this kind of object that had no consciousness and was releasing an unparalleled power in its original form. If he wanted to subdue it, he would have to use a powerful force to subdue it!<br/><br/>Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to subdue it at all!<br/><br/>“With my current strength, even if I add the Lin Bull, I wouldn’t be able to subdue it. Moreover, even if I subdue it, how would I be able to control it?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian frowned. He couldn’t handle this white flame flower!<br/><br/>It was too terrifying!<br/><br/>An object born in the chaos was really shocking!<br/><br/>“I can ask the Queen elf. She should know more! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought for a moment and took out a communication device.<br/><br/>This was the communication device between the few of them.<br/><br/>Through this communication device, they could communicate with each other in the chaos as long as it wasn’t too far away!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
