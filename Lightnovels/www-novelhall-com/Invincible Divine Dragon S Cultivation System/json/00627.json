Is this the powerful red-clothed woman mentioned in the universe’s AI?”<br/><br/>“It’s him. The old scholar suddenly appeared, but the Dragon King still didn’t make a move. The Dragon Palace still has experts!”<br/><br/>“This dragon palace is indeed terrifying. To be able to produce two existences that can contend against the supreme water demon king and the old scholar, no wonder the subordinate races of the Angel race were beaten up!”<br/><br/>The appearance of the old scholar surprised everyone!<br/><br/>The attack of the red-clothed spirit didn’t shock them too much!<br/><br/>This was because she was an expert of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>They were curious about how strong this red-clothed woman was!<br/><br/>“I want the dragon bone, not a pink skeleton!”<br/><br/>The old scholar looked at the red-clothed spirit, and half of his face slowly became ferocious as he said!<br/><br/>“Humph, a cultivator of the sage’s lineage hasn’t broken through for so long. He must be a trash with ill intentions. If that’s really the case, with such a temperament, you still want to break through?”<br/><br/>When the spirit red bone heard his words, he coldly snorted and spoke with a face full of disdain!<br/><br/>The sage’s lineage was the peak race’s lineage!<br/><br/>The old scholar’s temperament could be seen at a glance!<br/><br/>“You’re courting death. I’m going to skin you, Rip off your bones, and create a pink skeleton to hang on the wall!”<br/><br/>His words made the old scholar’s half-ferocious face become even more ferocious, and one of his eyes roared furiously!<br/><br/>He held the wings made of angel wings in his hand, and with a gentle wave, waves of terrifying golden light appeared. These golden lights condensed into characters and rushed toward the red spirit bone!<br/><br/>A single word from the line of saints could kill evil!<br/><br/>A painting could trap mountains, rivers, and rivers!<br/><br/>A song could transform countless lives!<br/><br/>This was the attack method of the saint’s lineage!<br/><br/>As for the fan made of angel wings in his hand, it was just a decoration!<br/><br/>The cultivation method of the saint’s lineage was somewhat similar to that of spell formation magi, but it was not the same.<br/><br/>Their attack methods were also very unpredictable and powerful!<br/><br/>Every word and action was a terrifying attack!<br/><br/>“Peng Peng Peng!”<br/><br/>Seeing the old scholar’s attack, red spirit bone waved his skirt, and a sea of blood-red fire headed toward the golden characters!<br/><br/>The old scholar was a metal-attributed expert!<br/><br/>The employer was killing!<br/><br/>“Peng Peng Peng!”<br/><br/>The Sea of fire that was like fresh blood was burning one character after another!<br/><br/>However, the golden characters seemed to contain a terrifying power, and did not immediately dissipate in the flames!<br/><br/>They continued to attack Ling Honggu, and only gradually disappeared a hundred kilometers in front of him!<br/><br/>When Ling Honggu saw this scene, he slightly frowned.<br/><br/>The other party’s strength was very strong, not weaker than that Monster King Tai Shui!<br/><br/>In fact, he had to be even more careful in his attacks!<br/><br/>“Mountain of books, suppress him!”<br/><br/>When the old scholar saw that his attack was blocked, his eyes revealed a cold expression!<br/><br/>He waved the fan in his hand and drew a golden book in front of him.<br/><br/>More and more books condensed into the shape of a mountain and directly attacked Red Spirit Bone!<br/><br/>“Burn Books!”<br/><br/>Red spirit bone saw the flame between his eyebrows jump, and a wisp of flame directly flew toward the Golden Mountain of books!<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>When it came to the sky above the mountain of books, a terrifying flame instantly burst out and covered the entire mountain of books.<br/><br/>At this moment, the same scene as the battle between the Archangel and the Space Beast appeared!<br/><br/>The water of the river of eternity stopped falling!<br/><br/>The entire river of eternity seemed to feel a tremendous terror, and the water stopped falling from the sky!<br/><br/>“So powerful! Is this the Invincible Zone’s expert? He’s really powerful!”<br/><br/>“My goodness, these old monsters are comparable to the Archangel who fought here last time. They’re too terrifying!”<br/><br/>“The experts of the Dragon Palace are also terrifying. Whether it’s the Frost Dragon of the Dragon Palace or this red-clothed lord, they are both very powerful!”<br/><br/>When the disciples of the experts within the heaven opening primal continent saw this, they were all so shocked that they couldn’t extricate themselves!<br/><br/>This battle felt no different from a battle between Masters of the Universe!<br/><br/>“HM?”<br/><br/>However, at this time, in the battlefield between Red Bone Spirit and the old scholar, the flames were burning the Golden Mountain of books. However, they weren’t able to completely burn it at this moment!<br/><br/>Spirit red bone waved his arm, and surges of blood-colored energy poured onto the mountain of books. The flames flourished, and only then did it completely burn!<br/><br/>“Hehe, with such strength, you’re still slightly inferior to that Frost Divine Dragon. I can kill you within ten minutes!”<br/><br/>The old scholar stared at Spirit Red Bone and said indifferently!<br/><br/>“I want to kill him within five minutes!”<br/><br/>However, just as the old scholar finished speaking, his savage half-face suddenly spoke. In the next moment, a terrifying scene appeared!<br/><br/>His half-face seemed as if it was about to be torn apart, and it started to break free from his head!<br/><br/>Slowly, the old scholar’s body was torn into two halves!<br/><br/>One looked extremely ferocious, and the other looked extremely benevolent!<br/><br/>“Jie Jie Jie, I want you to die, the paradise of Death!”<br/><br/>The ferocious old scholar’s body slowly healed, turning into a complete human. In his hand, he took out a golden paintbrush and drew in front of him!<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>When spirit red bone saw this strange scene, her eyebrows jumped. “Crimson, bone-splitting!”<br/><br/>She waved her skirt, and terrifying blood-red bones appeared behind her, attacking the sinister-looking old scholar!<br/><br/>“Golden Spear Iron Horse!”<br/><br/>At the side, the benevolent old scholar also took out a paintbrush and waved his arm.<br/><br/>One after another, golden iron horses seemed to instantly revive, heading towards the blood-red flaming bones!<br/><br/>“Bang! Bang! Bang!”<br/><br/>The sound of bones colliding could be heard continuously!<br/><br/>When spirit red bone saw this scene, he slightly frowned!<br/><br/>“Paradise of death, Success!”<br/><br/>“Hahaha!”<br/><br/>On the other side, the incomparably savage old scholar roared loudly. Spirit red bone instantly felt the space around him begin to change!<br/><br/>She was completely in a battlefield, surrounded by golden humans and warhorses, each and every one of them filled with ferocity!<br/><br/>Boundless and endless, they attacked her crazily!<br/><br/>“How can the old monster of the Invincible Zone be so strong? I’m still a little lacking, my experience is a little lacking!”<br/><br/>Red Bone Spirit swallowed a mouthful of saliva.<br/><br/>Compared to the old monster that had gone through countless life and death battles in the Invincible Zone, she was still a little lacking!<br/><br/>Her strength was still a bit lacking!<br/><br/>“That red-clothed woman is no match for the old scholar. The former ghost-masked scholar was very terrifying!”<br/><br/>“The battle was very exciting. It was not in vain for us to come here. The experts of the Dragon Palace are very powerful, but their experience is still a lot weaker, whether it’s the red-clothed woman or the Frost Dragon God!”<br/><br/>“The Frost Dragon God is also gradually losing. After all, the old scholar and the Tai Shui Monster King’s battle experience is too crazy. They have lived for another 10 to 20 billion years!”<br/><br/>The battle had already erupted for a few minutes, and spirit red bone and the old scholar had already been fighting for a minute.<br/><br/>The surrounding experts of the invincible region were commenting!<br/><br/>As for the disciples of the experts who came from the surroundings, they were all dumbfounded at this moment. They were too powerful!<br/><br/>“Alright, the formation can be broken!”<br/><br/>At this moment, in front of the Eternal Sky River, the Black Tower Magus’green pupils shifted as he spoke indifferently!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
