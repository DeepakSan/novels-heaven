Go<br/><br/>“The people from the Mohan clan have returned. They still have the remaining bloodline.”<br/><br/>“Universe knight level existences, the Mohan clan has not been completely destroyed. They still have universe knight level existences. They have returned!”<br/><br/>“The Red Mist clan has submitted to the Dragon Palace. Heavenly Emperor Hong Tian announced on the universe ai that the clan leader of the Mohan clan has ordered all the experts from the surrounding races to come and pay their respects.”<br/><br/>“Hiss, the sky has changed. It’s going to change here.”<br/><br/>When the surrounding races were shaken by the Mo Han clan, another piece of news that shocked everyone arrived.<br/><br/>The Red Mist race, God Emperor Hong Tian had submitted to the remaining experts of the Mo Han clan.<br/><br/>The remaining experts of the Mo Han clan had ordered all the factions to come and pay their respects.<br/><br/>Seeing this information, the expressions of all the powers changed.<br/><br/>They hesitated, but they still prepared to head over immediately.<br/><br/>A Universe Knight level existence hadn’t appeared in their space for over a billion years.<br/><br/>Such a terrifying existence could destroy all of them with a single slap.<br/><br/>Unless they didn’t want to stay in this space anymore, they could only submit to the orders of such a powerful existence.<br/><br/>The leaders of the various factions didn’t hesitate at all and immediately flew towards the direction of the Mohan clan ruins.<br/><br/>The Mohan clan ruins used to be the most prosperous place in this starry sky. Each of the races had a teleportation array to reach this place.<br/><br/>In less than two hours, the leaders and experts of the various factions had all arrived.<br/><br/>Their gazes swept the surroundings as they flew towards the direction of the Sky Tower.<br/><br/>“Everyone, please wait here for now. After all the powers have arrived, we will go and pay our respects to the clan leader of the Mo Han clan and the elders.”<br/><br/>When the group arrived, God Emperor Hong Tian, who was floating in the air, swept his gaze over the experts from the various powers as he spoke.<br/><br/>“Oh? Clan leader Hong Wu, are they really from the Mo Han Clan?”<br/><br/>The Pangolin clan leader and a group of experts flew over. They looked at God Emperor Hong Tian and asked with astonishment.<br/><br/>“They are the experts from the Mohan clan, the master of this place.”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian nodded.<br/><br/>His words caused the expressions of the leaders of the surrounding factions to change slightly.<br/><br/>According to the information they had obtained, the Mohan clan was once an extremely powerful and bloodthirsty race.<br/><br/>There were countless small factions and creatures that they had destroyed.<br/><br/>They were filled with fear towards a clan that had once been so brutal.<br/><br/>Time passed bit by bit as experts from various factions and clans arrived.<br/><br/>“The desolate race of the Qian Hai has arrived!”<br/><br/>Not long after, a group of people from the desolate race of the Qian Hai arrived. When they saw them, some factions spoke softly.<br/><br/>They knew that not long ago, a large number of disciples from the Qian Hai race had been killed. A peak divine emperor grand elder had also died at the hands of the remnant bloodlines of the Mo Han clan.<br/><br/>At this moment, the Qian Hai Race’s patriarch and the group of experts had extremely ugly expressions.<br/><br/>The grand elder had been killed, and his disciples had been killed. However, they did not dare to resist in the slightest. They even wanted to come and pay their respects.<br/><br/>This made them feel extremely humiliated.<br/><br/>“Alright, everyone is here.”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian saw the Qianhai race, Sky Flame domain-level race, Sky Nether Race, Ming Xuanzhi, and the pangolin race, as well as all the other domain-level races, he spoke indifferently and immediately flew inside.<br/><br/>The experts from the various factions followed closely behind.<br/><br/>Celestial Emperor Hong Tian waved his arm, and a huge bridge appeared in front of him.<br/><br/>Just like the heavenly path when the Red Mist race established their race, the path was connected to two stars.<br/><br/>At the end of the path, an old man sat in the middle of a huge square. Nine experts stood by the side and looked at the group of people indifferently.<br/><br/>“Greetings, clan leader of the Mo Han clan. Greetings, Elders.”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian flew over and greeted respectfully.<br/><br/>“Greetings, clan leader of the Mo Han Clan!”<br/><br/>The experts from the other factions didn’t dare to be the slightest bit negligent and immediately greeted respectfully.<br/><br/>The clan leader of the Mo Han clan didn’t say anything. His gaze swept over the group of people.<br/><br/>“Are all of you here?”<br/><br/>After a few seconds of silence, the clan leader of the Mo Han clan asked indifferently.<br/><br/>“Lord clan leader of the Mo Han clan, apart from the Dragon Palace, all the other forces have arrived.”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian said respectfully.<br/><br/>“Those who have arrived, Congratulations. Your lives have been saved. In the future, all of you will submit to our Mo Han clan. who has any objections?”<br/><br/>The clan leader of the Mo Han clan spoke indifferently to them.<br/><br/>Upon hearing his words, the expressions of all the experts from the other forces changed slightly, but no one dared to speak.<br/><br/>“I don’t like silence.”<br/><br/>Seeing that no one dared to retort, the clan leader of the Mo Han clan also didn’t respond, and his eyes revealed a trace of coldness.<br/><br/>“Weng!”<br/><br/>As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his arm, and a pitch-black rope instantly appeared in front of the Qian Hai clan leader and the other experts, instantly binding them.<br/><br/>“Honorable sir, we surrender, and our Qian Hai clan is willing to submit.”<br/><br/>The leader of the vast ocean race saw the black rope that instantly wrapped around him, and his face revealed an extremely terrified expression.<br/><br/>He hurriedly shouted out loud.<br/><br/>“Your Aura makes me hate you. You’ve taken over our Mohan clan’s domain planet, yet you still dare to be so arrogant. I’ll give you a chance to atone for your sins. If you don’t cherish it, then die!”<br/><br/>The leader of the Mohan Clan said indifferently, and clenched his hand.<br/><br/>The dark rope instantly turned blood red, absorbing the blood and energy in their bodies at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>“No, no, no, no. Sir Venerable One, give us a chance. We’re willing to submit, we’re willing, don’t kill me.”<br/><br/>The Qianhai clan’s patriarch screamed in terror.<br/><br/>However, the scream didn’t last long before it came to an abrupt stop. The Mohan clan’s Patriarch’s expression didn’t change at all,<br/><br/>the black rope turned into blood-red characters and entered his body.<br/><br/>“First Elder, bring a few people and let Hong Tian bring you to the vast race of the Qian Hai region to exterminate them.”<br/><br/>The clan leader of the Mohan clan said faintly.<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>The clan leaders nodded and looked at God Emperor Hong Tian.<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian’s expression changed and he immediately replied.<br/><br/>“Our Heavenly Flame clan is willing to submit to the Mo Han clan. We are willing to submit to Lord Supremacy. In the future, we will serve the Mo Han clan!”<br/><br/>When the heavenly flame clan’s experts saw this scene, their brows twitched violently as they hurriedly said respectfully.<br/><br/>“Our mountain-piercing clan is willing to submit to the Mo Han clan. We will take the Mo Han clan as our leader!”<br/><br/>“Our Thousand Hand clan is willing to submit to the Mo Han clan. Under Lord Clan Leader’s orders, we will not hesitate even if we have to go up a mountain of knives or down a sea of fire.”<br/><br/>The eyes of the experts from the various races were filled with fear. They hurriedly knelt on the ground and respectfully submitted.<br/><br/>An expert at the peak of the divine emperor realm was instantly killed without the slightest ability to resist. Such a scene caused them to be moved with fear.<br/><br/>At this moment, they were truly afraid!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
