She was stunned and filled with shock.<br/><br/>She quickly checked her own body and felt that there was nothing abnormal about it. Instead, she felt relaxed.<br/><br/>“Your talent is not bad, but this item has delayed your cultivation.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian kept the embryo and looked at Jian tianyao.<br/><br/>Yes, this embryo wanted to possess her body.<br/><br/>When the embryo completely fused with Jian tianyao, the embryo would have its attributes and replace Jian Tianyao perfectly.<br/><br/>At that time, Jian tianyao would disappear as well.<br/><br/>Wang Xian had obtained an opportunity. Similarly, he was helping Jian tianyao.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Wang Xian could sense that Jian Tian Yao’s talent was a little terrifying.<br/><br/>Her body contained the aura of a powerhouse in the Heaven’s origin realm.<br/><br/>It was very easy for such an existence to reach the threshold of the Heaven’s origin realm.<br/><br/>He didn’t know if it was the embryo’s transformation of her body or her innate talent.<br/><br/>Taking out the embryo from her body was equivalent to saving her life.<br/><br/>Wang Xian didn’t feel that he owed her anything.<br/><br/>“What is this?”<br/><br/>Jian Tian Yao stared at Wang Xian and asked.<br/><br/>“It’s an evil thing.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian didn’t say much. After that, he smiled and stood up. “You guys go ahead and eat first. We’ll meet again if we’re fated.”<br/><br/>As he spoke, he walked out directly.<br/><br/>This left a few people who were looking at each other.<br/><br/>“Tian Yao, that fellow must have taken some treasures from you.”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian walked out of the restaurant, a young man looked at Jian Tian Yao and said.<br/><br/>“However, there is nothing strange about my body. Instead, I feel much better. Furthermore, there aren’t any treasures in my body.”<br/><br/>Jian Tian Yao frowned and replied.<br/><br/>“Tian Yao, what he took out of your body is definitely some treasure. Maybe it’s a fortuitous encounter that belongs to you. Otherwise, we have never met him before. How could he be so kind to help you?”? “Besides, it’s obvious that he didn’t want to tell the truth just now and left directly. It’s obvious that he obtained some benefits!”<br/><br/>A woman next to him also guessed.<br/><br/>“We can’t let him leave. He must have taken the treasure from junior sister Tian Yao.”<br/><br/>Jian Tianyao’s senior brother stood up immediately. His gaze focused as he spoke!<br/><br/>“Let’s go and ask him clearly!”<br/><br/>Jian Tianyao thought for a moment and nodded her head.<br/><br/>The six of them moved and flew out immediately.<br/><br/>When they saw Wang Xian who had not gone far, their gaze focused.<br/><br/>They flew over in an instant and surrounded him!<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw them flying out to surround him, he raised his eyebrows slightly and his gaze landed on Jian Tianyao.<br/><br/>“What exactly did you take from me? I need to ask clearly. Otherwise, I won’t feel at ease!”<br/><br/>Jian Tianyao looked at Wang Xian and said.<br/><br/>“I can tell you.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at her and was silent for a second, he did not hide anything. “A strong person will perform a possession in your body. He will absorb the energy in your body and fuse with you. When he wakes up, it will be the time for the possession to be completed. Now, you can try to absorb the energy to cultivate and see if you have undergone a huge change!”<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>Jian Tian Yao’s expression changed slightly when she heard Wang Xian’s calm reply.<br/><br/>Possession?<br/><br/>There was an expert who wanted to possess her?<br/><br/>How was that possible?<br/><br/>However, she still followed Wang Xian’s method and absorbed the surrounding energy.<br/><br/>In an instant, she felt that the energy that entered her body was twice as much as before.<br/><br/>This caused her expression to change slightly.<br/><br/>If she had this kind of absorption speed and talent in the past, she would have already broken through to the peak of the Overlord realm!<br/><br/>“Junior sister Tian Yao, is what he said true?”<br/><br/>The young man beside her asked Jian Tian Yao.<br/><br/>“It’s true. I realized that the speed of my absorption of energy has increased by a lot.”<br/><br/>Jian Tian Yao nodded her head and looked at Wang Xian with a twinkle in her eyes.<br/><br/>“Is this true? We only met master not too long ago. Master didn’t notice the abnormality in your body. This…”<br/><br/>The young man was also a little shocked!<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them and shrugged his shoulders!<br/><br/>Unless it was an existence at the level of Great Dao who possessed special abilities, it was impossible to detect the abnormality in her body!<br/><br/>“An expert who is able to parasitize your body and attempt to possess it. Even your master, who is at the peak of the Dominator realm, was unable to detect it. Then, what realm is this parasitized expert at?”<br/><br/>Beside her, a woman’s face was filled with astonishment as her gaze flickered.<br/><br/>What realm was he at?<br/><br/>Jian Tian Yao’s heart was also shaken.<br/><br/>She was a disciple of a great sect, and a disciple of the sword sect, the strongest force in the sword universe.<br/><br/>In the entire sect, there were many Tianyuan Destiny realm experts.<br/><br/>In the Justice Alliance, their status was also very high.<br/><br/>Although it had been a long time since he had encountered a Tianyuan Destiny realm expert, he had frequently encountered seniors at the peak of the ruler realm.<br/><br/>None of these seniors had noticed the abnormality in her body.<br/><br/>Didn’t that mean that those who wanted to possess him were existences at the ruler realm and above.<br/><br/>When she thought of this, she felt a lingering fear.<br/><br/>Why would such an existence want to possess her body?<br/><br/>Did she provoke any existences?<br/><br/>In addition, if it was a possession, under normal circumstances, an expert would encounter a life-and-death crisis and had no choice but to choose possession.<br/><br/>This was considered the lowest choice in the revival of an expert.<br/><br/>“In other words, that black thing just now might be the consciousness and body of an expert in the Destiny Realm?”<br/><br/>A young man also guessed something and exclaimed in surprise!<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian heard their exclamations and looked at their contemplative expressions. He did not hide anything. “It’s mutually beneficial. I’ll help you to prevent you from being possessed and to prevent you from being killed. That embryo is the reward!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian had nothing to hide from them.<br/><br/>If he were to hide it, he could take it out silently.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian did not choose to do so in the beginning because if it was a woman’s opportunity, it would be beneath his status to snatch a woman’s opportunity in such a manner at his level.<br/><br/>Even though he could sense the aura of the Heaven’s origin destiny in her body.<br/><br/>Moreover, snatching someone’s opportunity would also provoke her enemies.<br/><br/>The opportunity of others might have been given to her by an expert in her universe.<br/><br/>He snatched it away directly. It was purely a provocation. He wanted to start a war.<br/><br/>When he sensed that the thing in the woman’s body was about to possess her, Wang Xian made his move directly.<br/><br/>After all, if he made his move and helped her, he would also be able to obtain the opportunity!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
