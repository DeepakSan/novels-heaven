Bang! Bang!”<br/><br/>One chain after another wrapped around Lei Shan. Wang Xian’s dragon claws disappeared and turned into an ordinary fist. He kept attacking Lei Shan!<br/><br/>Every attack carried the power of the Divine Dragon!<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>A series of miserable screams kept coming out of Lei Shan’s mouth!<br/><br/>As an old crazy demon, Lei Shan was naturally very strong.<br/><br/>However, there was a huge gap between him and Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“I’ll give you three seconds to choose. Surrender or Die!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stretched out his palm and grabbed Lei Shan’s neck. He stared at Lei Shan calmly!<br/><br/>“Cough cough, cough cough, I surrender, I surrender!”<br/><br/>Lei Shan did not hesitate at all and shouted hurriedly.<br/><br/>He made the same choice as Ming Shaisheng and the rest not long ago!<br/><br/>“Swallow the dragon’s blood and summon the universe God Nation over!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at him and ordered!<br/><br/>Lei Shan nodded his head quickly and stared at Wang Xian with a face full of fear. He did as he was told!<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s strength made him feel a little hopeless!<br/><br/>After dozens of seconds, after Lei Shan was suppressed by the Dragon Palace in the God nation, he completely surrendered!<br/><br/>He stood respectfully in front of Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“Hehe!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head in satisfaction. His body moved and he flew to the side!<br/><br/>On the other side, Wu Sha, water demon, Ming shasheng, and demon wings were surrounding Shi Sen and sky-shrouding!<br/><br/>In a two-on-one situation, they were no match for them!<br/><br/>However, they could barely hold on!<br/><br/>“Cough cough, Shi Sen, sky-shrouding, surrender. The Dragon King is invincible!”<br/><br/>Lei Shan looked at Shi Sen and the others who were fighting against Wu Sha and said directly!<br/><br/>Shi Sen’s expression changed drastically when he heard Lei Shan’s voice. He immediately looked in their direction!<br/><br/>“You were suppressed by the Dragon King so quickly?”<br/><br/>Shi Sen widened his eyes and roared in disbelief!<br/><br/>“Yes, the Dragon King is not someone we can fight against. If you don’t want to die, surrender!”<br/><br/>Lei Shan nodded and tried to persuade them!<br/><br/>“I’ll give you ten seconds to consider. If you still resist after ten seconds, you will die. Don’t think about reviving with your life-saving treasure. Wu Sha can track your divine kingdom’s Location!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them and warned them!<br/><br/>He didn’t make a move either. There was no need to make a move now!<br/><br/>They should know what to do!<br/><br/>“I Surrender!”<br/><br/>Shi Sen’s expression changed drastically as he lowered his head slightly.<br/><br/>“I Surrender Too!”<br/><br/>Blotting out the sky was a tree with wood attributes. It had an incomparably huge body!<br/><br/>He transformed into a human and lowered his head as he spoke!<br/><br/>Surrender!<br/><br/>Even if he didn’t want to be a subordinate, the other party had a magus and an old witch. Even if they had a life-saving treasure, they would still be caught!<br/><br/>At that time, they would be completely finished!<br/><br/>“Very good!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled!<br/><br/>If the two mad demons of heaven-shrouding stone forest submitted, he would be able to subdue the seven mad demons!<br/><br/>Each of the seven mad demons could fight against three level one masters of the universe alone!<br/><br/>They were the Top-notch Masters of the Invincible Zone!<br/><br/>In the invincible zone, there were only about ten mad demons.<br/><br/>And now, the crazy demon and the crazy demon prohibition were killed by Wang Xian.<br/><br/>The old witch, Ming Shisheng, water demon, demon wings, heaven shrouding, Shi Sen, and Lei Shan, the seven crazy demons had surrendered!<br/><br/>The strength beside Wang Xian was already very, very terrifying!<br/><br/>After completely subduing Shi Sen, Wang Xian brought them back to the inner part of the ancient Hengxu Divine Kingdom immediately!<br/><br/>“Consume all 200 ordinary embryo fruits. How long will it take for all of you to break through?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood in front of them. His gaze swept across the seven of them as he asked with a twinkle in his eyes!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I will take a few years or a dozen years to achieve a breakthrough!”<br/><br/>Wu Sha was the first to speak!<br/><br/>Water Demon and the rest also made a rough guess!<br/><br/>If it was fast, it would take a few years. If it was slow, it would take more than a dozen years!<br/><br/>“Don’t be in a hurry to achieve a breakthrough. Wait for a dozen years, especially in the invincible zone. Don’t make a breakthrough!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought for a moment and said to them!<br/><br/>Experts at the first level of the universe dominator were prohibited from fighting here!<br/><br/>Therefore, they could not break through for the time being!<br/><br/>“In addition, the heaven-shrouding stone, Thunder Flash, bring all the divine fruits, herbs, medicinal pills, and other resources from your universe God country over!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued to give them orders.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Who Was Heaven Shrouding Stone Thunder Flash and the rest nodded their heads and replied immediately!<br/><br/>Very soon, a large amount of resources were piled up in front of him. Wang Xian swept his gaze over, and his gaze was a little fiery!<br/><br/>The resources needed for a breakthrough were sufficient!<br/><br/>After another upgrade, his strength would receive another terrifying increase!<br/><br/>“First, I’ll upgrade. Then, I’ll sell the longevity fruit in my hands. Finally, I’ll go hunt the desolate beast space behemoth!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself. He waved his hand at Wu Sha and the rest and immediately began to devour the resources!<br/><br/>All sorts of resources and treasures entered his stomach and quickly turned into Dragon Qi!<br/><br/>The Aura on his body was also constantly rising!<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>“Ding! Congratulations to host for breaking through to the level 8 of a universe Knight.”<br/><br/>“Ding! Congratulations to host for breaking through to the level 8 of a universe knight. You have comprehended the law aspect: the Netherworld Dragon’s pursuit!”<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. Five days later, an incomparably terrifying dragon’s might and crisp sounds were emitted from Wang Xian’s dragon body!<br/><br/>At the same time, the system’s voice rang out!<br/><br/>Waves of terrifying aura surged out from his body. The Phantom image of a divine dragon was revolving around him!<br/><br/>“This… The Dragon King has achieved a breakthrough? What a terrifying aura. This aura is not weaker than an existence at the second level of the Universe Dominator.”<br/><br/>Around them, Wu Sha, Ming Sha, and the other crazy demons felt the might of Wang Xian. Their pupils contracted slightly and their faces were filled with shock!<br/><br/>“It’s not weaker than a level two universe overlord. However, the Dragon King has not broken through to the Universe Overlord realm. How is this possible? How can he have broken through so many levels?”<br/><br/>Ming Sha said with a face full of shock!<br/><br/>After reaching the universe ruler realm, one normally didn’t count combat power!<br/><br/>Normally, as long as one could break through to the universe ruler realm, compared to ordinary humans in the universe, one could jump three levels to fight!<br/><br/>If one could jump levels to fight, then there was no such thing as jumping levels to fight!<br/><br/>Hence, one would be classified according to their levels!<br/><br/>A Level 1 universe ruler was a level 1!<br/><br/>It was not the title of a level four universe dominator. This title was used to address those who had not broken through to the level of a universe dominator!<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s current strength was comparable to a level two universe dominator. If he was addressed as an expert who had not reached the level of a universe dominator, he would have the combat strength of a level five universe dominator!<br/><br/>To have such combat strength but not break through to the level of a universe dominator was a little abnormal!<br/><br/>One had to know, according to the terms used by the great beings below the ruler realm, a peak universe knight, even the disciples of a peak race, could only have the combat strength of a universe ruler at level three!<br/><br/>And the Dragon King was two levels higher than them?<br/><br/>What kind of concept was this?<br/><br/>This was completely abnormal!<br/><br/>“In the past, the Divine Dragon Clan also had such abnormal existences, the Five Elements Dragon King and the yin-yang Dragon King, but it seems that the five elements Dragon King and the yin-yang Dragon King only gave birth to one each, could it be that our Dragon King is also at this level?”<br/><br/>Wu Sha guessed!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
