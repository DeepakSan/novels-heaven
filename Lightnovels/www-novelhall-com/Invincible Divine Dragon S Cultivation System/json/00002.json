If we can help, we will definitely not decline!”<br/><br/>While the Dragon Palace was preparing for battle, at the center of the glazed domain, the glazed celestial emperors said to Prime Minister Gui with smiles on their faces.<br/><br/>“Hehe, there’s nothing to hide. There are two great centers in the center of the universe that have already learned the location of the entrance to the resplendent starry sky. They want to deal with our Dragon Palace, so a big battle will break out next.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui looked at them and laughed.<br/><br/>“This… Prime Minister Gui, are the races in the center of the universe strong? Can the dragon palace withstand it?”<br/><br/>The glazed region leader asked with surprise.<br/><br/>“I don’t know, the problem is very serious. If Our Dragon Palace is defeated, we might leave this place.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui slowly retracted his smile and said seriously.<br/><br/>When the glazed domain Lord and the others heard Prime Minister Gui’s words, their expressions changed slightly.<br/><br/>“Prime Minister Gui, is there anything we can help you with?”<br/><br/>A divine emperor asked with a solemn expression.<br/><br/>“There’s no need. I’ll return after exchanging some resources with everyone.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui shook his head.<br/><br/>“Domain Lord, all of our resources have been brought over!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a divine emperor walked in and said to the domain Lord.<br/><br/>“Prime Minister Gui, Here!”<br/><br/>The domain Lord said as he handed the interspatial ring to Prime Minister Gui.<br/><br/>“Alright, then this old man will return to the Dragon Palace First!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui received it and his figure slowly disappeared.<br/><br/>“Domain Lord, the Dragon Palace might really be in big trouble this time!”<br/><br/>Looking at Prime Minister Gui’s disappearing figure, a divine emperor said with a solemn expression.<br/><br/>“This might not be a good thing for our resplendent starry sky. The Dragon Palace’s current control is pretty good.”<br/><br/>A God emperor beside him said with a frown.<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace is facing an expert from the center of the universe after all. That is a powerful existence in the legends. Domain Lord, the Dragon Palace has saved our entire glazed domain. We…”<br/><br/>An old woman hesitated for a moment before speaking.<br/><br/>“Hehe, perhaps now is the time for us to repay the favor.”<br/><br/>The domain Lord smiled as he swept his gaze across the god Emperors.<br/><br/>“This is an opportunity for us to experience the power of the great being at the center of the Universe.”<br/><br/>The group of godly emperors smiled and made up their minds.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Without the resources that Deacon Qian sent, it would be very difficult for us to enter this starry sky, Hahaha!”<br/><br/>At the same time, in the depths of the eight desolation six directions, three old men with four arms passed through a weak array formation and laughed loudly.<br/><br/>“Deacon Qian has made a great contribution this time!”<br/><br/>An old man on the right glanced around with a smile.<br/><br/>“Let the other disciples come in first. There might be a big battle this time!”<br/><br/>The four-armed old man in the middle waved his hand and said.<br/><br/>“It’s the Elder!”<br/><br/>The old man on the right nodded.<br/><br/>“The three-eyed race is not weak. However, since you are leading the team this time, the Divine Dragon will definitely belong to us.”<br/><br/>The old man on the left flattered.<br/><br/>Behind them, figures came in one by one.<br/><br/>Very quickly, close to 100,000 figures stood behind them.<br/><br/>100,000 people. The weakest had an undying god King Level 7 combat strength. Amongst them, there were 600 to 700 god Emperor level experts.<br/><br/>The strongest was the old man in the middle, the elder of the four armed race, a void God Emperor Level 6 expert.<br/><br/>This strength was less than one-twentieth of the four-armed race.<br/><br/>However, they could only gather so many people under such a critical situation.<br/><br/>The other more powerful armies were preparing to rush over.<br/><br/>However, the distance was too far, and they might need more than ten days.<br/><br/>“Let’s go and contact Deacon Qian!”<br/><br/>The leader, elder Ren, swept his gaze across the surroundings and said indifferently.<br/><br/>The 100,000 advance troops of the four-armed race immediately flew forward.<br/><br/>And right in front of them, a figure was hiding.<br/><br/>“Buzz!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a figure flashed, holding a compass in his hand, and suddenly appeared on the left side of the four-armed race’s army.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>However, it only lasted for a moment before the figure disappeared.<br/><br/>Elder Yi from the four-armed race looked to his right in puzzlement. His eyes revealed puzzlement.<br/><br/>“What’s wrong, elder Yi?”<br/><br/>A four-armed race deacon asked curiously.<br/><br/>“Nothing!”<br/><br/>Elder Yi shook his head and did not think too much about it.<br/><br/>“Four-armed race. There are 703 God emperors and the strongest is at the sixth level of the god Emperor Realm.”<br/><br/>A figure appeared in the void of the eight desolation six harmonies. He looked at his detection compass and revealed a smile.<br/><br/>At the next moment, his figure disappeared.<br/><br/>Ten minutes later, at another location in the eight barrens and six directions, a large group of people passed through layers of obstacles and stepped into this void.<br/><br/>They had three eyes and were emitting a powerful aura.<br/><br/>There were more than 80,000 members. The weakest had the strength of a rank seven god King while the strongest was a rank six void God Emperor.<br/><br/>“There are six void God emperors and 633 god Emperors.”<br/><br/>Soon, a figure appeared before leaving.<br/><br/>“That Dragon Palace can easily suppress this starry sky. The dragon God can easily subdue it. Most importantly, it’s the people from the four-armed race.”<br/><br/>“The Dragon God belongs to our three-eyed race. Hahaha, this time, I want to subdue an inferior dragon as my mount!”<br/><br/>“Everyone, be alert. If those fellows from the four-armed race dare to snatch it from us, we will kill them!”<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>A passionate voice was heard from the group of people. All of them had excited expressions on their faces.<br/><br/>They must obtain the Divine Dragon!<br/><br/>Every member of the three-eyed race was filled with fighting spirit. They flew forward quickly.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Dragon King, the two major races have arrived!”<br/><br/>Three seconds after the arrival of the two major races, an lie had already reported the news to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>In the Dragon King’s Hall, the group of leaders heaved a sigh of relief when they saw the news of the two tribes.<br/><br/>“Let’s go over as well!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood up slowly. His eyes were sparkling.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, there’s news from the four-armed tribe and the three-eyed tribe. Should we think of a way to defeat them one by one?”<br/><br/>At the side, the eight-limbed demon duo were staying on the Deacons of the two tribes. They immediately asked when they received the news from the advance army.<br/><br/>“There’s no need. The biggest threat is the two level six divine emperor powerhouses. If they gather together, the Dragon Cave will be easier to attack.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head.<br/><br/>With the two large tribes gathered together, it would reduce the number of accidents.<br/><br/>When the time came, they would capture all of them in one fell swoop.<br/><br/>“There’s only one chance. Eight-limbed demon duo, both of you try your best to severely injure the two level six divine emperor powerhouses.”<br/><br/>The sky array said to the eight-limbed demonic fiend.<br/><br/>“Don’t worry. We’ll do our job. You Don’t have to worry. TSK TSK, the two of US might be able to kill those two level-six divine emperors in a sneak attack!”<br/><br/>The eight-limbed demonic fiend said confidently.<br/><br/>“Alright, let’s Go!”<br/><br/>A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. His body moved and he flew out.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>Roars filled with fighting spirit reverberated throughout the entire Dragon Palace.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
