With the strength of a divine emperor, one can break through this place. However, this place is located at the very edge of the area. There are few people here and it is not easy to be discovered. Sky Formation, seal this place again and try not to be discovered.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest appeared at the entrance where the four-armed race entered the starry sky.<br/><br/>He instructed the Heaven Formation.<br/><br/>This entrance was also the most dangerous one. One didn’t need to be very strong and didn’t need to use many techniques to pass through it directly.<br/><br/>The only advantage was that this place was more remote. There were huge ruins outside and it was difficult to be discovered.<br/><br/>However, the four-armed race already knew the approximate location of the entrance.<br/><br/>If they were to search outside, they might be able to enter within a few months.<br/><br/>The Heaven Formation would be able to hide for a longer period of time by setting up some illusory formations, defensive formations, and the like.<br/><br/>It might be able to buy the Dragon Palace a few years of development time.<br/><br/>After a few years, the Dragon Palace might not be afraid of them.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King. Leave this to me!”<br/><br/>The Heaven Formation nodded and scanned his surroundings. Then, he moved and flew out.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest followed closely behind.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>From the exit, a magnificent void appeared in their line of sight.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s dragon eyes of Yin Yang and five elements scanned his surroundings. His body moved and he turned around.<br/><br/>“Is this the ruins of the Mohan Palace?”<br/><br/>Looking at the huge ruins and the chaotic space, they were extremely shocked.<br/><br/>The Lair of a race at the center of the universe was actually so huge and terrifying.<br/><br/>Just the remnants of the chaotic energy were enough to make one’s heart palpitate.<br/><br/>The chaotic energy within could kill an existence at the level of a universe knight.<br/><br/>It was vast and shocking!<br/><br/>“Is this the center of the Universe?”<br/><br/>Heaven array muttered as he looked at his surroundings.<br/><br/>Even when he was at his peak, he had never been to the center of the universe.<br/><br/>“This is only the edge of the Mo Han Room ruins. Alright, seal this place. Let’s go to the center of the ruins.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said with a smile.<br/><br/>The heaven’s formation nodded its head. It scanned its surroundings and began to set up the formation.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest waited by the side.<br/><br/>After two full days, the heaven’s formation had set up a large number of formations to cover this place. Then, they teleported to another location.<br/><br/>The other entrance was much more complicated than this one. There was no one to lead the way. If they were lucky, they would be able to enter within a short period of time. If they were unlucky, they would never be able to leave.<br/><br/>Therefore, Wang Xian and the rest did not cover up this entrance.<br/><br/>“This place is already the center of the Universe!”<br/><br/>When they exited from the entrance that the three-eyed race had entered, they were surrounded by dilapidated buildings. Wang Xian and the rest of the six walked out with a hint of anticipation on their faces.<br/><br/>“This place is already the center of the universe.”Octahedron looked around and said curiously.<br/><br/>“Yes, this place is already the center of the universe. However, it is still very remote. Come, let’s go out!”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, he flew straight in a direction according to the memories in his mind.<br/><br/>The surroundings were filled with dilapidated buildings. The entire lair of the Mohan clan was floating in the void.<br/><br/>It was formed by dozens of continents and 9,999 planets.<br/><br/>The Mohan clan’s grand array was based on these 9,999 planets. The grand array was activated and sealed off a world.<br/><br/>Currently, some of the planet’s great formation had been cracked while some continents had been found to have access to it.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest flew out for a total of five days.<br/><br/>“They’re out!”<br/><br/>After five days, there was a pure void in front of them. There were stars in the void.<br/><br/>The star in the middle was abnormally huge. It was hundreds of times larger than the surrounding stars.<br/><br/>That star was emitting a red glow. They could see human figures flying on the star.<br/><br/>“That is the sun refining star. The flames emitted by the sun refining star are very gentle and can remove impurities. It is a very good body refining star. Even if the celestial emperor is refining his body on it, it will have a great effect!”<br/><br/>“Furthermore, the gravitational force of that star is hundreds of thousands of times stronger than that of other stars. The celestial emperor can barely fly on that star.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the planet in front of him and said.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, are you saying that the people on that planet are all celestial thearch powerhouses?”<br/><br/>Tian Chen and the rest looked at the human figure on the huge planet in shock and asked in astonishment.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded. “This is the center of the Universe!”<br/><br/>“No wonder many of the great formations in the books are based on the stars. Some of the stars already possess immense power. I’m afraid that the refined sun planet in front of us would only be slightly damaged even if the celestial thearch were to attack it with his full strength!”<br/><br/>The Sky Formation sighed slightly.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. Let’s fly towards the center of the Mo Han clan’s ruins!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and flew towards the right.<br/><br/>“There are all kinds of people here. There are also all kinds of demonic beasts!”<br/><br/>After flying for more than an hour, there were more and more races around them.<br/><br/>There were humans with two heads, humans with tails, humans with two horns on their heads, and some members of other races with intelligence.<br/><br/>Their heads were huge!<br/><br/>Their arms were huge!<br/><br/>They were spherical!<br/><br/>There were all kinds of them. It was like entering a fantasy world in a movie.<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>“Dragon King, there’s a battle over there!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the sound of a battle could be heard from the right. An Lie’s eyes were sparkling as he watched the battle.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest swept their gaze over. Two powerhouses at the second level of celestial thearch were engaged in a battle. There were also some powerhouses who were watching the battle.<br/><br/>They swept their gaze over and did not stay any longer. They continued to fly forward along the ruins of the Mohan clan.<br/><br/>“There’s a teleportation formation on the planet in front of us. We can teleport directly to the central location from the teleportation formation!”<br/><br/>After flying for a few more hours, Wang Xian saw a planet in the ruins.<br/><br/>The planet appeared to be very ancient. There were many people moving about on it.<br/><br/>This was one of the 9,999 planets of the Mohan clan.<br/><br/>The restrictions on it had been broken, and some forces had taken over it.<br/><br/>“Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>They landed on the planet. According to the memories in their minds, the six of them arrived at the teleportation array.<br/><br/>The Mohan clan’s ruins were very large. If they flew, they would not be able to reach the center in a few years.<br/><br/>They could only use the teleportation array.<br/><br/>“Buzz!”<br/><br/>After paying a large sum of divine stones, they arrived at a planet in the middle of the Mohan clan’s ruins.<br/><br/>Just as they walked out of the teleportation formation, there was a very eye-catching building in front of them.<br/><br/>It was a gigantic tower of Babel that extended straight into the sky.<br/><br/>With Wang Xian and the rest’s line of sight, they couldn’t see the top of the tower when they raised their heads.<br/><br/>“This is the Tower of Babel. It used to be the training ground for the disciples of the Mohan clan. There are 99 levels in the Tower of Babel. For every level that one ascends, one will receive some rewards. Currently, the highest person will enter the 55th level. Some people say that this is the inheritance ground of the Mohan clan. One can obtain the inheritance of the Mohan clan if one ascends to the top!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at the Tower of Babel in front of him as his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>His first target was this tower of Babel!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
