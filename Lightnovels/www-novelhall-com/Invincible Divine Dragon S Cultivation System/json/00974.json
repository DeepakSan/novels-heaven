He knew these two things.<br/><br/>After absorbing the memories of the Master of the Void Moon Forbidden Ground, he understood a lot of information.<br/><br/>The Void Moon forbidden ground was destroyed billions of years ago.<br/><br/>However, the universe ruins and the abyss of Demonic Beasts had always existed in the sword and Magic Universe.<br/><br/>The universe ruins was an ancient battlefield in the sword and Magic Universe.<br/><br/>The ancient battlefield still contained endless power.<br/><br/>According to Wang Xian’s guess, that should be the calamity battlefield of this universe.<br/><br/>The special corpses and treasures obtained from the dragon roar forbidden ground should have been obtained from there.<br/><br/>Wang Xian also knew that the abyss of Demonic Beasts was a territory where demonic beasts lived.<br/><br/>Demonic Beasts were similar to the space beasts, but their size and strength were much smaller than the space beasts.<br/><br/>However, the abyss of Demonic Beasts had a large number of demonic beasts at the Overlord level.<br/><br/>They had no intelligence and mainly focused on hunting!<br/><br/>“Long yinyin, do you know the ranking of the forbidden lands on the continent?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued to ask her.<br/><br/>“About this, don’t you know about this?”? There was a ranking of a forbidden land on the continent. The first place was the unfettered forbidden land. The founder of the unfettered forbidden land was also an existence above the ruler realm. The second place was the Flowing Water Holy Land. The founder was also an existence above the ruler realm. The third place was the space forbidden land. The founder, old man time, was known as an existence invincible in the ruler realm<br/><br/>“This is the top three. There are also rankings up to the top 20. Wang Xian, I’ll<br/><br/>Get You a communication device later. That communication device was made in the unfettered forbidden land. It’s also the one with the most users! ”<br/><br/>“It has the rankings of all the forbidden lands in the Holy Land. You can also obtain other information! ”<br/><br/>Long Yin spoke to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“HMM, alright. Are there only two rulers and above on our continent?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked.<br/><br/>(‘I think so. I’ve never heard of a third one!”<br/><br/>Long Yin nodded with a hint of respect on his face. “I heard that during the last calamity, these two lords led the powerhouses on our continent to resist the foreign enemies and stopped their invasion!”<br/><br/>“I heard that there was a terrifying war that broke out and turned into the ruins of the universe. That war was so destructive that even the legendary book of water curse on our continent was destroyed!” HMM?<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard her words, his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>Book of Water Curse?<br/><br/>Could it be that Lord Water God Dragon was involved in the war?<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself as his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>“Oh, what are you going to do next?”<br/><br/>He looked at Long Yin Yin and asked.<br/><br/>“I will continue to cultivate and strive to reach the pinnacle of the Universe<br/><br/>Knight Realm. Only when I reach the pinnacle of the Universe Knight realm can<br/><br/>I travel far and train. I can also enter the universe ruins and the abyss of Demonic Beasts to take a look. ”<br/><br/>Long Yin said.<br/><br/>“Oh? Do I have to reach the peak of the Universe Knight Realm?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at her curiously.<br/><br/>“Yes, you have to reach the peak of the Universe Knight Realm. Moreover, when a universe knight reaches the realm of the universe ruler, it is the biggest shackle for all cultivators. This realm is very difficult to break through. Even the holy sons and Saintesses will be stuck in this shackle for at least tens of millions of years. ”<br/><br/>Long Yin said, “Therefore, under normal circumstances, once you reach the peak of the Universe Knight Realm, you can go out to train and break through as soon as possible. If your luck is good, you might be able to break through in a few million years! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded. “Then why don’t you go into closed-door cultivation now?<br/><br/>We can go out together then. ”<br/><br/>(‘MMM, that’s great.”<br/><br/>Long Yin replied happily, “However, will this delay your cultivation? I will need at least ten million years to reach the peak of the venerable realm. ”<br/><br/>Alright!<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head and said, (‘I also need to train my swordsmanship. I can train for ten million years First! ”<br/><br/>“MMM, then I will definitely reach the peak of the venerable realm as soon as possible. When that time comes, I will go out with you to train. ”<br/><br/>Long Yin said with a smile. He was exceptionally happy.<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled. “Alright, let’s train as soon as possible. I will go and train too!<br/><br/>Okay!<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved and flew towards his residence in the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground.<br/><br/>At the Heaven Peak of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground, he had a very luxurious place to stay!<br/><br/>There was a magic array that gathered the power of space inside.<br/><br/>However, the energy here was much, much less than in the tower of the Moon!<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian did not plan to go to the Holy Moon to cultivate. The resources in his hands were enough for him to cultivate for tens of millions of years.<br/><br/>One must know that the space-attribute items given to him by the elders were all elixirs and spirit fruits of level five or six universe Dominators!<br/><br/>The value of these items was not low!<br/><br/>They could allow him to cultivate to level three or four universe Dominators!<br/><br/>Wang Xian sat cross-legged in the cultivation room and immediately began to cultivate!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>His body shook and a wave of spatial energy gushed out into the surroundings.<br/><br/>He easily broke through to the first level of the Universe Dominator!<br/><br/>Following that, he took out the resources and treasures of the spatial attribute and began to absorb them!<br/><br/>After two million years, Wang Xian’s cultivation base had risen to the second level of the universe dominator.<br/><br/>He moved and arrived at the second level of the Heaven Peak!<br/><br/>The Heaven Peak of the Dragon Roar forbidden ground was divided into many levels. As long as one reached the dominator level, he would be able to have a residence on the Heaven Peak!<br/><br/>The higher the level, the denser the water attribute energy contained. The dragon roar forbidden ground mainly focused on the cultivation of the water attribute.<br/><br/>Although the place where Wang Xian lived was in a relatively high position, his space attribute and the denser water attribute did not have much effect on<br/><br/>him!<br/><br/>Two million years to reach the second stage of the Overlord realm was too slow for Wang Xian with sufficient resources.<br/><br/>However, it was absolutely terrifying for other powerhouses.<br/><br/>Dragon Roar Yin was at the eighth stage of the Universe Knight Realm. It would take tens of millions of years to cultivate to the peak of the Universe Knight realm with unlimited resources.<br/><br/>Furthermore, she had the talent of a saintess.<br/><br/>One could imagine how difficult it was to cultivate.<br/><br/>A special existence like Wang Xian was like a master of the universe who was at level eight or nine who died. After being resurrected, he would use the resources to cultivate again.<br/><br/>His speed was terrifying!<br/><br/>The second level of the sky peak was a training ground.<br/><br/>On the second level, one could spar with each other and gain some experience.<br/><br/>It was unknown if it was a unique feature of this universe. Like the training method in the tower of the Moon, the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground also had<br/><br/>The virtual image formed by the formation could be adjusted to a higher level before the battle!<br/><br/>Wang Xian was preparing to practice today.<br/><br/>When he cultivated the Heaven’s origin sword technique to the level of the universe’s ruler, Wang Xian felt a little strained.<br/><br/>One had to know that his actual combat strength had already reached an extremely terrifying level.<br/><br/>However, it was still a little strenuous to cultivate it. One could imagine the difficulty of this heaven’s origin sword technique.<br/><br/>A sword technique that could be practiced to the Tianyuan realm was not that simple!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
