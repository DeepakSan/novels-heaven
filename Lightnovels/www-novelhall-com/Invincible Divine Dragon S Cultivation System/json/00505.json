Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>“Hello, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Figures slowly appeared on the surrounding trees.<br/><br/>More than ten figures flew over and greeted Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Hello!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian glanced at them and nodded with a smile.<br/><br/>There were thirteen people. Each of them had the combat strength of a universe dominator. One of them was a level 2 universe dominator.<br/><br/>There were only two purebred divine dragons. Azure Dragon Moon and the Master of the universe were both purebred divine dragons.<br/><br/>Apart from them, Wang Xian could sense that one of them should be a peak dragon species related to the wood attribute.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, let me introduce you. This is my senior, Azure Dragon Whisker Shadow. This is…”<br/><br/>Azure Dragon Moon introduced them to Wang Xian one by one.<br/><br/>“I’ve heard so much about you!”<br/><br/>“Haha, it’s US who have heard so much about you. Dragon King, you managed to force the Hundred Cities Alliance to such an extent by yourself. How impressive!”<br/><br/>Green Dragon Whisker Shadow said with a smile.<br/><br/>“We were just using tricks!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian replied humbly.<br/><br/>“There’s no such thing as using tricks in a war. The strength of the Dragon Palace is also unquestionable. We really admire you, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The Green Dragon Whisker Shadow said with a smile.<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and exchanged a few pleasantries with him. Then, they flew in a direction.<br/><br/>They were standing on a wooden ship. The ship was not big, only a hundred meters in size.<br/><br/>It contained a powerful force.<br/><br/>The speed of flying in the sky was very fast.<br/><br/>This was the flying treasure of the Green Dragon Whisker Shadow. It could carry people.<br/><br/>Their destination this time was the land of entanglement.<br/><br/>The land of entanglement was a very strange place, which was relatively close to the elves.<br/><br/>Above the land of entanglement was an incomparably huge forest, the area of the forest was much larger than the land of magical bones.<br/><br/>The most magical thing was that beneath the countless trees in the land of entanglement was the underground river world.<br/><br/>Just like Earth in the past, there was an underground river.<br/><br/>It was the same here. It was an extremely huge underground river.<br/><br/>Above the land of entanglement and in the underground river, there were countless desolate beasts.<br/><br/>Over there, the largest number of desolate beasts were plant-type desolate beasts.<br/><br/>These desolate beasts could be a flower or a tree. They were extremely dangerous.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace of that senior of the ancestral dragon lineage was in the underground river of the land of entanglement.<br/><br/>After being killed, the great beings of the ancestral dragon lineage asked them to inherit the Dragon Palace of that senior.<br/><br/>To prevent it from being obtained by the Holy Dragon lineage.<br/><br/>And the Holy Dragon lineage also sent people to look for that senior’s God country.<br/><br/>After all, the god country of a universe ruler level three great being was a huge treasure to both the ancestral dragon lineage and the Holy Dragon lineage.<br/><br/>After flying for two months and three days of teleportation in the city, they finally arrived at the land of entanglement.<br/><br/>In a world covered by trees, towering trees rose up from the ground, making the ground look wet.<br/><br/>In some places, the ground was even wet.<br/><br/>“Let’s go in!”<br/><br/>The Green Dragon Whisker Shadow said, and the wooden ship rushed toward the ground.<br/><br/>It broke through the soil and drilled downwards.<br/><br/>“Splash!”<br/><br/>Ten minutes later, they entered the underground river in the entanglement zone.<br/><br/>The entire underground river was pitch black. However, for experts like them, unless it was a special energy zone, there was no distinction between day and night.<br/><br/>“The water in this underground river still contains some energy.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed the river water and said with a smile.<br/><br/>To the weak, this river water was still holy water.<br/><br/>“It’s also because of the energy of the underground river that the trees above are so lush. Brother Wang Xian, when you reach the bottom of the underground river, you will see that the bottom of the river is also a forest world.”<br/><br/>Green Dragon Moon said with a smile.<br/><br/>“Brother Green Dragon Moon, have you been here before?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked him curiously.<br/><br/>“I have been here once, but we don’t know where that Senior’s Dragon Palace is.”<br/><br/>Qinglongyue replied.<br/><br/>The current ancestral dragon lineage could not be compared to the peak of the Divine Dragon lineage. At the peak of the Divine Dragon lineage, their Dragon Palace was placed in a sea area. Everyone knew about it.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace was equivalent to the divine kingdom. Everyone knew about the divine kingdom. To an ordinary powerhouse, this was an act of courting death.<br/><br/>However, everyone knew about the Dragon Palace back then. No one dared to say that they wanted to destroy a dragon palace.<br/><br/>Even if it was a dragon palace that was below the realm of a universe dominator.<br/><br/>That was because they were a peak race.<br/><br/>It was different now. The Dragon Palace of that senior from the ancestral dragon lineage was hidden. It was very troublesome to search for it.<br/><br/>“Do you have the items and treasures of that senior?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked them.<br/><br/>As long as they could find the treasures that the elder used when he was alive, they would be able to find it.<br/><br/>“It’s useless. That Elder said that his dragon palace has gone through a special concealment. We can’t find the exact location using witchcraft. We need to investigate it bit by bit!”<br/><br/>The figure with the Azure Dragon Beard shook his head.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded slightly. Such existences all had their own powerful abilities.<br/><br/>It was normal for them to be able to conceal the detection of sorcery.<br/><br/>“We can only use the most primitive method and search in a carpet style. We will split up and each of us will sense an area.”<br/><br/>The Azure Dragon Whisker Shadow looked at them.<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>Everyone nodded their heads.<br/><br/>“We have to be careful here. Firstly, we have to be careful of the creatures in the underground river. According to the records, there might be a level three desolate beast with the combat strength of a universe overlord here. Secondly, we have to be careful of the people from the Holy Dragon lineage. There should be experts among them who have already entered this place.”<br/><br/>The Green Dragon Whisker Shadow reminded.<br/><br/>Everyone nodded again.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, we are located at the center of them. If there is any danger around us, we can lend a hand!”<br/><br/>The Green Dragon Whisker Shadow looked at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“No problem.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head.<br/><br/>Very soon, they separated immediately. They could sense each other’s location and searched in a carpet-like manner.<br/><br/>Wang Xian came to a spot and scanned both sides of him.<br/><br/>“Advance and search!”<br/><br/>The voice of the Green Dragon Whisker Shadow was heard. Wang Xian and the rest flew forward and landed at the bottom of the underground river.<br/><br/>At the bottom of the river, there were all kinds of trees and bushes. Some of the trees were tens of thousands of meters tall, and the entire river was full of vitality.<br/><br/>Wang Xian could sense the presence of many fishes, but the realm of these fishes was not very high.<br/><br/>Sensing their surroundings and the front, they flew forward.<br/><br/>They kept moving forward. After more than ten hours, there were fluctuations coming from the right side. There were sounds of battle.<br/><br/>“What’s going on?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked telepathically.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, it’s not a big problem. We encountered a level one desolate beast, the ruler of the universe. It has escaped!”<br/><br/>A voice was heard.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head and the group continued to move forward.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, the water energy here is abundant. It’s a good place.”<br/><br/>The King of water touch appeared on Wang Xian’s shoulder and looked around with his three eyes.<br/><br/>“Can you sense anything?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked her.<br/><br/>“My senses are still very strong in the water. Other than the water plant in front of me, which is a desolate beast with the combat strength of A Level One universe dominator, I haven’t detected anything else.”<br/><br/>The water touch king said.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
