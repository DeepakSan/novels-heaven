Inform me immediately once you confirm their location. ”<br/><br/>“Sir Dragon King, the consciousness of the cosmic beasts is very strong. If there is a heaven origin cosmic beast battle in the universe, it might attract all the heaven origin cosmic beasts. Hence, if you want to kill the other Cosmic Beasts, you need to do so when they leave the universe! ”<br/><br/>Hun Dun spoke.<br/><br/>“Do you need them to leave the universe? Alright, you keep an eye on them. I will send the disciples of the Dragon Palace to enter the universe from the passageway. Once there is news, inform the disciples of the Dragon Palace and I will rush over immediately. ” Wang Xian spoke to Hun Dun.<br/><br/>“Alright, Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>Hun Dun nodded.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded at him and left immediately.<br/><br/>His trip to the starry universe this time was not in vain.<br/><br/>Although it was not 100% certain that he could kill a space beast.<br/><br/>Although it was something that could not be confirmed.<br/><br/>However, this also planted a seed.<br/><br/>If he could really kill a space beast created by the Heaven’s origin, he would have one more subordinate by then.<br/><br/>One more subordinate of a cosmic beast.<br/><br/>In addition, Wang Xian had more or less grasped the situation of the starry universe!<br/><br/>After returning to the nine-origin universe, Wang Xian told the fallen Shadow Devil Emperor’s Protection Legion about the starry universe.<br/><br/>In the past, the nine-origin universe had nothing to do with the starry universe.<br/><br/>There were no disputes either.<br/><br/>They didn’t know much about the specific situation of the starry universe.<br/><br/>When the Heavenly Yuan creator powerhouses in the nine-origin universe received the news, they didn’t have any fluctuations.<br/><br/>As for asking them to hunt the space beast?<br/><br/>Unless they had five or six heavenly yuan creator powerhouses working together.<br/><br/>Not only could they work together, but they also needed to know the exact location of the Heavenly Yuan creator Space Beast.<br/><br/>When would they leave the starry universe.<br/><br/>The probability of success in the hunt was too low!<br/><br/>Therefore, the Heaven’s origin creation powerhouses in the nine-origin universe were not interested in the space behemoth.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian was very interested in the space behemoth!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Not long after returning to the nine-origin universe, Wang Xian arrived at the six-path universe under the lead of an lie!<br/><br/>Sensing the location of Tianci, Wang Xian flew over quickly.<br/><br/>The Apocalypse had begun, but there was not much commotion in the six paths universe at the moment!<br/><br/>The six paths universe had six attributes, and it could only give birth to six heaven origin destiny realm powerhouses. Currently, it had taken up four spots.<br/><br/>There were still two spots left.<br/><br/>However, the strength of the six paths universe was not very weak. If the powerhouses from other universes wanted to invade this place, they would have to think twice.<br/><br/>After all, when the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan creation appeared in the six paths universe, many of the powerhouses of Tianyuan creation had some understanding of the strength of the six paths universe.<br/><br/>The undead in the six paths universe was still very powerful.<br/><br/>“Foster father is here!”<br/><br/>It was located at the junction of the grassland and the water source of the six paths universe.<br/><br/>A huge tribe was located here.<br/><br/>In the tribe, Tianci sensed Wang Xian’s aura and stood up immediately.<br/><br/>“Foster Father! ”<br/><br/>In the next moment, Wang Xian’s figure appeared in the main hall.<br/><br/>Tianci saw it and shouted with a smile.<br/><br/>“HMM, how is the current six paths universe?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked Tianci.<br/><br/>“Foster father, we don’t have any problems at the moment. What About Your Universe?”<br/><br/>Tianci asked.<br/><br/>“We don’t have any problems there either. I’m here to see you. I have something to tell you! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian told Tianci about the matter of hunting the cosmic behemoth of the Heaven’s origin creation.<br/><br/>Under the circumstance that it would not affect the six paths universe, if he wanted to make a move, he would ask Tianci to come over.<br/><br/>Naturally, Tianci did not have any objections and agreed immediately.<br/><br/>Wang Xian naturally told Tianci that if the six paths universe was in danger, he would help even if there was no danger in the nine-origin universe!<br/><br/>After staying in the six paths universe for more than a year, Wang Xian returned to the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>With the existence of the dark forces, it was very convenient for Wang Xian to carry out long-distance teleportation.<br/><br/>Time passed by little by little.<br/><br/>In the blink of an eye, millions of years passed by in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>Millions of years were still in the early stages of the cataclysm. There was no danger in the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>There were also no reckless beings from other universes who stepped into the nine-origin universe!<br/><br/>However, when another million years had passed, there was news from the Chaos!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>After Wang Xian received the news, he immediately asked an lie to bring him to the starry universe.<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>When he arrived at the chaotic domain, Hun Dun immediately greeted him respectfully when he saw Wang Xian<br/><br/>“HMM, you don’t have to be so polite. Just tell me directly. What level is the Heaven’s origin creator and where is he currently?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian immediately asked Hun Dun.<br/><br/>“Dragon King is one of the 15 Great Beast Emperors, the Nine Corpse Beast Emperor. The strength of the Nine Corpse Beast Emperor should be ranked behind the 15 Heaven’s origin cosmic beasts. His strength is definitely not at the level of control!”<br/><br/>“Currently, the Nine Corpse Beast Emperor has already left the infinite starry sky and is flying towards the east. Beast emperors usually do not leave the infinite starry sky. Once they leave, they should be preparing to eat and Hunt! ”<br/><br/>Hun Dun immediately replied!<br/><br/>“Nine Corpse Beast Emperor? How much do you know about him? What Special Abilities Does this space beast have?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes focused as he asked!<br/><br/>“I don’t know about that. I have never seen a space beast of the Heaven’s<br/><br/>origin creation level attack before. The nine-corpse Beast Emperor has a human form with nine arms. Its entire body is emitting a foul stench. The name nine-corpse Beast Emperor was given by us back then! ”<br/><br/>Hun Dun said.<br/><br/>“Alright, I’ll go and take a look!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head. With a wave of his arm, a wave of energy enveloped him. “You come with me.”<br/><br/>Hun Dun nodded.. His eyes were filled with anticipation!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
