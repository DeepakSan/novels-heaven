He began to absorb it slowly.<br/><br/>Following the absorption of this stone of origin.<br/><br/>There was a layer of grey energy surrounding Wang Xian completely.<br/><br/>Slowly, Wang Xian seemed to have turned into a gray ball!<br/><br/>This ball was almost identical to the primal chaos stone!<br/><br/>The only difference was that this ball had life force and vitality!<br/><br/>This was a very special existence.<br/><br/>“This? ? He is undergoing the final transformation!”<br/><br/>“This… After this transformation, will his strength reach beyond the primal Chaos Realm?”<br/><br/>“In order to break through, I did not hesitate to allow myself to undergo nirvana. I did not hesitate to spend an endless amount of time. I did not hesitate to take a huge risk. However, I did not succeed. Now, he is about to succeed?”<br/><br/>“This is simply a trick of fate. How did he become so powerful?”<br/><br/>The Nine Heavens Divine Roc was somewhat incredulous.<br/><br/>He felt somewhat dazed.<br/><br/>In order to break through, he did not hesitate to take a huge risk to undergo nirvana.<br/><br/>In the end, he failed!<br/><br/>A living being who suddenly barged into his place succeeded!<br/><br/>This was a huge irony!<br/><br/>However, after the irony, his eyes were filled with fervor and anticipation.<br/><br/>He hoped that the other party could achieve a breakthrough.<br/><br/>He hoped that the other party could tell him a way to achieve a breakthrough!<br/><br/>He also wanted to reach an existence above Chaos!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian and the primal Chaos Stone had achieved a 100% fusion!<br/><br/>Wang Xian realized that he had become the primal chaos stone.<br/><br/>No, he had become one with the primal chaos stone.<br/><br/>The next moment, with a thought, he reverted back to his previous appearance from a round ball!<br/><br/>However, at this moment, he could sense the powerful energy in his body!<br/><br/>“Ding, congratulations to host for leveling up and breaking through to the unknown domain.”<br/><br/>“Ding, congratulations to host for breaking through and possessing the power of chaos to evolve into the Divine Dragon of Chaos.”<br/><br/>Name: Wang Xian<br/><br/>Race: Divine Dragon of Chaos (man-dragon unity)<br/><br/>Level: unknown<br/><br/>Supernatural ability: Chaos Control and engulfing all living things (engulfing all living things to increase strength)<br/><br/>Divine Kingdom: Dragon Palace<br/><br/>Possessing Dragon Palace: Innate.<br/><br/>Dragon Palace member: 8060450<br/><br/>At this moment, the system’s voice sounded. Following that, an attribute appeared in his mind.<br/><br/>“This? ? My attributes have completely changed. My race has become the Chaos Divine Dragon? Everything else has changed. My supernatural ability and dharma idol have disappeared. Even my level is unknown!”<br/><br/>“Has the transformation been completed?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was a little surprised by the change in his attributes. He stretched out his arm and observed it carefully.<br/><br/>He sensed his body. At the same time that he felt that he was powerful, he also felt that he was not too powerful.<br/><br/>There was a limit to how powerful he could be.<br/><br/>According to Wang Xian’s speculation, he could at most be comparable to three existences at the level of chaos.<br/><br/>However, he realized that his body was filled with uniqueness!<br/><br/>It was the kind of energy that encompassed everything.<br/><br/>In fact, as long as Wang Xian wanted to, he could incorporate everything here into his body and slowly convert it into his own energy!<br/><br/>In addition, Wang Xian had gained control of an additional special energy in his body.<br/><br/>He had come into contact with this energy before — the power of Time!<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s body trembled. An invisible energy enveloped his surroundings. He could feel that time had slowed down in the area that was enveloped by him!<br/><br/>“This is… the power of time?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes glowed.<br/><br/>He moved his palm and with a thought, any energy could be gathered in his palm.<br/><br/>Even if it was the mutated frost power, the Bone Dragon’s special darkness power, or the special power of the cursed demonic spirit.<br/><br/>He could even release the power of faith!<br/><br/>As long as it was the energy that he came into contact with, he could unleash it!<br/><br/>“The most powerful thing is still the power of time. As long as I cover the area, I can control the flow of time. The flow of time is a hundred times faster.”<br/><br/>“And now, the area that my power of time can cover is about a few hundred planets. This area is already very wide!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself.<br/><br/>In addition, he realized that his coverage was selective.<br/><br/>In other words, within the area that he covered, he could choose not to cover certain objects.<br/><br/>In other words, if he were to release this power of time when he was fighting with the enemy.<br/><br/>In that case, it would be equivalent to one second for the enemy and one hundred seconds for him.<br/><br/>In that case, he could easily kill the opponent within a hundred times the opponent’s time.<br/><br/>The opponent wouldn’t even have time to react!<br/><br/>Within the range of his time domain, his speed would increase by a hundred times!<br/><br/>It was absolutely terrifying!<br/><br/>Was this a time domain?<br/><br/>This was an invincible domain.<br/><br/>“That’s not right. My Time Domain can be affected by the outside world. In other words, if there’s an expert releasing energy, he can also affect the time within my time domain!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian gave it a simple test and said!<br/><br/>Even so, this ability was already very terrifying!<br/><br/>Although the energy in his body could only fight against three existences at the primal chaos realm.<br/><br/>However, Wang Yun felt that five to six existences at the primal Chaos Realm were no match for him in a real battle!<br/><br/>His time domain was close to being invincible!<br/><br/>In addition, he could convert any kind of energy. It was simply too powerful!<br/><br/>In addition, he also realized that he could still continue to cultivate.<br/><br/>Yes, he could continue to improve his strength.<br/><br/>He could absorb any kind of energy in the universe to strengthen his strength!<br/><br/>“I can absorb everything and improve myself!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian confirmed.<br/><br/>“Not bad!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian revealed a satisfied expression.<br/><br/>The 100% integration with the primal chaos stone had improved his combat strength by a lot!<br/><br/>In addition, he realized that he didn’t need any weapons at all.<br/><br/>He didn’t need the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation.<br/><br/>That was because he could simulate the attack of an ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation if he wanted to.<br/><br/>He could imitate the attack of a heaven origin destiny treasure.<br/><br/>That was how terrifying it was.<br/><br/>In fact, he could even absorb the heaven origin destiny treasure and increase his own strength!<br/><br/>Of course, such actions were too wasteful!<br/><br/>Chaos absorbed everything and could be converted into everything.<br/><br/>As long as there was something in the world, it could be converted.<br/><br/>In other words, it would be much easier for him to groom his subordinates in the future.<br/><br/>He could use the power of chaos to completely imitate a powerful divine fruit.<br/><br/>Of course, this action would weaken Wang Xian’s own power of chaos and weaken his strength.<br/><br/>However, this ability was really abnormal.<br/><br/>It was really terrifying!<br/><br/>As long as Wang Xian had sufficient resources, he could definitely make the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace improve rapidly and improve crazily!<br/><br/>He could absorb and transform everything.<br/><br/>This ability was too heaven-defying!<br/><br/>It was too terrifying.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
