Each of them had more than a thousand of them!<br/><br/>Especially the soul-returning fruits. They were definitely the most precious treasures in the universe!<br/><br/>“The seed of advancement has also undergone a huge change. The improvement of the ancestral tree has greatly shortened the time it takes for the seed to grow. Now, it can mature after a million years!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled to himself. His eyes were filled with excitement.<br/><br/>A million years was not a long time for a high-level race or an expert. It could even be said to be very short!<br/><br/>And the Dragon Palace could produce a seed of advancement within a million years. What kind of concept was that?<br/><br/>A hundred million years could produce a hundred masters of the Universe Overlord Realm in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>100 might not seem like a lot, but one must know that these seeds could be used by the warriors of the Dragon Palace who had difficulty advancing!<br/><br/>If the Dragon Palace had developed for 10 billion years, then the Dragon Palace could produce 10,000 universe ruler Realm Warriors!<br/><br/>This number was terrifying!<br/><br/>In addition to the warriors of the Dragon Palace who could break through on their own, there were even more!<br/><br/>There was another prerequisite for this. Under the current situation of the ancestral tree, if the Dragon Palace had the opportunity to improve once again, the ancestral tree would absorb a huge amount of energy and the time needed for the seed of advancement to be born would be shortened once again!<br/><br/>The seed of advancement was definitely a rare treasure!<br/><br/>“In the current Dragon Palace, even if the experts from the angel race were to charge over, they would still be able to put up a little resistance. Of course, it would only be a little resistance.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian muttered to himself as a smile appeared on his face!<br/><br/>The current Dragon Palace was getting stronger and stronger!<br/><br/>After checking all the buildings in the Dragon Palace, the ancestral dragon lineage had completely integrated into the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>From then on, the ancestral dragon lineage had completely disappeared.<br/><br/>The strength and foundation of the Dragon Palace had received a huge increase!<br/><br/>Take the level three masters of the universe as an example, there were already 175 of them!<br/><br/>175?<br/><br/>What kind of concept was that?<br/><br/>Just a few of them could wipe out a high-level race!<br/><br/>As for those who were comparable to a true universe dominator, there were three of them, excluding Wang Xian!<br/><br/>Bei Shuang, Xiao Yu, and Fan Qinglan.<br/><br/>One Frost Divine Dragon and two bone dragons!<br/><br/>As for the Water Touch King, he was currently absorbing the energy of the supreme water demon king. He should be able to recover soon!<br/><br/>After he recovered, the Dragon Palace would have a universe ruler level Space Beast!<br/><br/>Currently, the power of the Dragon Palace was extremely terrifying!<br/><br/>However, it was still much weaker than a pinnacle race, even the weakest pinnacle race!<br/><br/>According to the information on the Universe AI, the weakest pinnacle race had a few hundred universe ruler level warriors!<br/><br/>No one knew the exact number!<br/><br/>In the following time, the six million disciples of the ancestral dragon bloodline started to turn into pinnacle dragon species!<br/><br/>The number of the Dragon Palace’s army was expanding rapidly!<br/><br/>Two years was very short in the inner part of the heaven opening primal continent.<br/><br/>Two years was enough for a large number of experts from the inner part of the continent to come. Some pinnacle races and experts from the invincible region could also come!<br/><br/>The auction of the Dragon Palace caused a huge commotion!<br/><br/>The auction of a connate true treasure, such a level of treasure, was something that even universe masters from peak races coveted!<br/><br/>Especially the experts from the peak races of Light and darkness!<br/><br/>At the same time, it attracted a large number of experts from the invincible region!<br/><br/>Among them, there were many old monsters on the level of the old scholar and the Supreme Water Demon King!<br/><br/>When there was still a month before the auction, there were already experts who came to the surroundings of the river of eternity.<br/><br/>“It seems that there will be many experts from different races coming this time. I wonder how many experts from the peak races who are masters of the universe will come!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood in the Dragon Palace. With a wave of his arm, everything in the river of eternity was displayed in front of him!<br/><br/>This was the investigative power of the Dragon Palace. It could cover the entire river of Eternity!<br/><br/>“It will definitely attract many masters of the universe to come. There are also many masters from the Invincible Zone!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister GUI smiled and said, “Currently, our auction venue has been set up. Dragon Palace, do you want to bring out some of our special treasures for auction?”<br/><br/>The special treasures mentioned by Prime Minister Gui were the fruits on the ancestral tree!<br/><br/>Soul-returning embryo fruit, endless embryo fruit, nirvana thunder embryo fruit, ordinary embryo fruit, and so on. These fruits, especially those of the soul-returning embryo level, were definitely extremely valuable!<br/><br/>Wang Xian pondered for a moment and swept his gaze across the fruits on the ancestral tree.<br/><br/>“Let’s decide based on the number of strong cultivators who are coming. If there are more strong cultivators coming this time, we can sell one soul-returning embryo fruit!”<br/><br/>He thought for a moment and replied!<br/><br/>The fruits were very precious, but selling one wouldn’t be a problem!<br/><br/>After all, although these life-saving treasures were precious, powerful high-level races and peak experts all had them!<br/><br/>It wouldn’t be a problem for the Dragon Palace to sell one!<br/><br/>Of course, if the outside world knew that the dragon palace had thousands of fruits, even peak races would disregard the rules and directly destroy the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>Treasures of this level were too precious!<br/><br/>“Also, let me inform you that if any powerhouse wishes to sell an item for auction, you can entrust it to us for auction. We will take a 5% commission!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke to Prime Minister Gui!<br/><br/>There might be many powerhouses coming this time. Many of these powerhouses had useless treasures. If they wanted to auction, the Dragon Palace could provide them!<br/><br/>Of course, the Dragon Palace could also earn a large amount of commission!<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister GUI nodded and immediately flew out!<br/><br/>Weng<br/><br/>Soon, at the side of the Dragon Palace, there was a huge auction site!<br/><br/>Around the site, sky array and the others had set up a large number of arrays!<br/><br/>The harvest this time had increased the number of level 3 universe Dominators to 15!<br/><br/>15 level three universe Dominators with level three combat strength could set up a formation that could trap and kill a true universe dominator!<br/><br/>The auction of the Dragon Palace had to be guaranteed this time!<br/><br/>It was to intimidate those who didn’t know the difference between life and death!<br/><br/>In addition, Wang Xian was prepared to have 100 level three universe Dominators from the Dragon Palace to guard the surroundings when the auction began!<br/><br/>This was also to prevent accidents from happening!<br/><br/>At the same time, it was also a deterrent to other forces!<br/><br/>A line of words was suspended above the auction. The general meaning was that the dragon palace would be taking over the business of the auction!<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>Around the river of Everlast, some of the powerhouses from the forces that were closer to the Dragon Palace had arrived ahead of time.<br/><br/>Their eyes flickered slightly when they saw this message!<br/><br/>However, they weren’t too surprised.<br/><br/>It was normal for the Dragon Palace to accept the auction.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
