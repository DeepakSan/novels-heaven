Hong! Hong<br/><br/>The sky above the water cloud race was instantly enveloped by waves of terror!<br/><br/>There were 10 universe masters with the Combat Power of a level three universe master, and over 20 universe masters with the Combat Power of a level two universe master.<br/><br/>With such a great being floating in the sky, just the terrifying power alone was enough to cause the clouds and mist above the entire crouching Dragon Lake to evaporate rapidly and disappear!<br/><br/>A terrifying pressure rushed down.<br/><br/>The lake water started to churn!<br/><br/>The terrifying power froze everything in the surroundings!<br/><br/>Ten universe masters with level-three Combat Power locked down a place, and two or three universe masters with level-three combat power couldn’t even think about escaping!<br/><br/>In a battle of the same level, three against one, the opponent wouldn’t even have a chance to escape and would be killed!<br/><br/>Not to mention, according to the information the Sacred Dragon Son and the others received, this expert of the ancestral dragon bloodline was in seclusion here!<br/><br/>This was the Dragon Palace of the ancestral dragon expert!<br/><br/>“Sir, did our Shuiyun clan offend you? If we did, we are willing to compensate you!”<br/><br/>In the Crouching Dragon Lake, when this terrifying aura rushed down, the disciples of the Shuiyun clan held their breaths!<br/><br/>Some of the weaker disciples even died on the spot.<br/><br/>The five figures of the Shuiyun clan flew out of the lake, their faces covered in cold sweat and terror as they spoke loudly!<br/><br/>The Shuiyun clan had the body of a human, and half of their fish bodies looked like mermaids!<br/><br/>They respectfully lay on the surface of the water, filled with fear under this aura!<br/><br/>“Immediately get that defective tooth of the ancestral dragon bloodline out. Today, this son of the dragon will come and take his head!”<br/><br/>The Holy Dragon Son swept his gaze across the five experts of the Raincloud clan and shouted loudly!<br/><br/>“Oh?”<br/><br/>When the five experts of the Raincloud clan heard this, their pupils constricted slightly.<br/><br/>They raised their heads and looked at the Holy Dragon Son and the group of divine dragons and dragon seeds that were emitting a terrifying aura. Their expressions changed slightly!<br/><br/>“Lord Holy Dragon Son, this is the domain of our Raincloud clan. There are absolutely no experts of the ancestral dragon clan like you said!”<br/><br/>The elder at the center of the Water Cloud Race said respectfully!<br/><br/>“Hahaha, are you not coming out? If you don’t come out today, I will destroy your water cloud race!”<br/><br/>Hearing their words, Holy Dragon Son’s face was filled with coldness!<br/><br/>He stretched out his arm, which immediately turned into a terrifying dragon claw and charged toward the five warriors of the water cloud race.<br/><br/>“No!”<br/><br/>The five great beings of the water cloud race were only at Universe Master Level One.<br/><br/>Feeling the attack of the Holy Dragon Son, despair appeared on their faces!<br/><br/>Hong<br/><br/>However, before they could react, the light dragon claw landed on their bodies and instantly killed them!<br/><br/>The light dragon claw charged toward the Crouching Dragon Lake at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>“Sir Holy Dragon Son, we really don’t have the ancestral dragon experts that you speak of!”<br/><br/>At the bottom of the Crouching Dragon Lake, a few hundred figures blocked the terrifying dragon claw and shouted loudly.<br/><br/>“If you don’t have them, then I will completely exterminate your water cloud clan!”<br/><br/>“Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>Holy Dragon Son’s eyes revealed a disdainful killing intent as he stared downwards as if he was looking at a group of ants. He immediately transformed into a divine dragon, “A bunch of reckless things. Today, I will exterminate your clan!”<br/><br/>“Holy Dragon Son, you are courting death!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a violent voice came from below. A terrifying figure with a sky-blue dragon head and a unique fish tail flew out from within!<br/><br/>He had a huge body that was tens of thousands of meters tall. His body was emitting blue light!<br/><br/>“Hahaha, defective tooth, the defective tooth of the ancestral dragon lineage, you are indeed here!”<br/><br/>The son of the sacred dragon laughed maniacally when he saw the shadow that flew out!<br/><br/>Niya, an expert of the ancestral dragon lineage, who was flying over, looked at the group of Divine Light Dragons and dragon seeds of the same level in the sky. His pupils constricted slightly!<br/><br/>“Son of the Sacred Dragon, what are you trying to do? Are you trying to make an enemy out of our ancestral dragon lineage?”<br/><br/>He stared at the son of the sacred dragon with a dark and cold expression and roared!<br/><br/>“Niya, have you gone into seclusion and become stupid? The Great War between our sacred dragon lineage and your ancestral dragon lineage has already erupted for more than a thousand years. Your leader of the ancestral dragon lineage has already been destroyed by my father. Hahaha, you are still trying to make an enemy out of your ancestral dragon lineage?”? What a joke<br/><br/>When the Sacred Dragon Son heard his words, he could not help but laugh out loud!<br/><br/>“This is impossible. How can our ancestral dragon leader be a traitor like you? How can that Lackey, the Sacred Dragon King, be able to kill him!”<br/><br/>Niya growled with a face full of trust!<br/><br/>However, just as he finished speaking, he heard the voice of the Patriarch of the water cloud clan coming from below.<br/><br/>The voice sounded in his mind!<br/><br/>When he heard this news, his face changed drastically!<br/><br/>“This is impossible. How could our leader be killed by the Sacred Dragon King?”<br/><br/>He roared in disbelief!<br/><br/>Because he had been in closed-door cultivation, the Raincloud clan couldn’t disturb him. Therefore, he had just received this news!<br/><br/>This made him feel extremely incredulous!<br/><br/>The leader of the ancestral Dragon Clan had actually been killed by the Sacred Dragon King!<br/><br/>“Haha, don’t worry. Before long, all of your ancestral dragon lineage will go down to accompany your ancestral dragon leader. Niya, I’ll give you a choice. Submit to our holy dragon lineage or Die!”<br/><br/>The Holy Dragon Son roared with a face full of wild laughter!<br/><br/>“Submit to you? Submit to you traitors and lackeys, things that have tainted the Divine Dragon Bloodline?”<br/><br/>Que Ya’s eyes turned red as he stared at the son of Saint Dragon and roared ferociously!<br/><br/>“You are courting death. Since you have chosen to die, I will grant you your wish. Today, I will personally kill you.”<br/><br/>A fierce look appeared in the son of Saint Dragon’s eyes as he swayed his huge body, he directly attacked que ya, “One on one, if you can hold on, I will only take your head. If you lose one on one, I will destroy the entire Raincloud clan, Hahaha!”<br/><br/>“Let’s Fight!”<br/><br/>Saint Dragon Son roared and opened his mouth, the innate supreme treasure dragon eyes appeared in front of him.<br/><br/>“Roar Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>His body shook again, and a bright mountain peak with terrifying power appeared above him.<br/><br/>The mountain peak also released a terrifying pressure!<br/><br/>Two innate supreme treasures!<br/><br/>These were the innate supreme treasures that the Saint Dragon King gave him. With two innate supreme treasures, Saint Dragon Son was basically invincible!<br/><br/>“Two innate supreme treasures!”<br/><br/>When Chia Ya saw the dragon eyes and the mountain peak of light, his heart thumped violently and his eyes revealed an extremely embarrassed expression.<br/><br/>He was a peak dragon species and his combat strength was not weaker than the Divine Light Dragon. However, he did not have a terrifying weapon at the level of an innate supreme treasure!<br/><br/>With a weapon at this level, he could kill someone of the same level with just one weapon!<br/><br/>And he actually had two.<br/><br/>“Kill!”<br/><br/>However, at this moment, he also knew that his refusal meant that he would definitely die today.<br/><br/>However, he didn’t want the Shui Yun clan to be implicated. His entire body was filled with the will to die as he charged forward!<br/><br/>He would fight with his life!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
