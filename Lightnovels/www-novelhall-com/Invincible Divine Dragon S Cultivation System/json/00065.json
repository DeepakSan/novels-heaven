They lived here like ordinary people.<br/><br/>Each of them used an extremely special method to hide their strength.<br/><br/>“According to the information I received, there are only two ninth level divine emperor experts in the town today. The rest have left for the core area of the ice mountain race.”<br/><br/>“There’s a teleportation array in that room. Once there’s a problem, the experts of the ice mountain race can teleport here instantly.”<br/><br/>The ice continent was sealed day and night. However, the ice mountain race operated like a meteorite, causing the day and night to alternate.<br/><br/>As night came, the town was not very lively at night. Most of the people were in their own rooms.<br/><br/>Wang Xian leaned against a wall and looked at the surrounding buildings as he muttered.<br/><br/>“A level nine divine emperor is in a room beside the teleportation formation. I want to kill him instantly.”<br/><br/>His dragon eyes scanned the room and his figure slowly sank into the ice wall.<br/><br/>Wang Xian had eight attributes now. He could travel through objects with eight attributes. Naturally, the ice wall did not block him at all.<br/><br/>The process was smooth.<br/><br/>As the hidden army of the iceberg tribe, they did not involve any powerful formations or other protective measures.<br/><br/>This was because once they set up the formation, people would definitely notice the difference and suspect it.<br/><br/>As a secret army, it was necessary for everyone not to know about it.<br/><br/>Even Wang Xian learned about it from the son of an elder of the ice mountain tribe.<br/><br/>Only such a core figure could know about this place. It was obvious that there were less than a few hundred people in the entire ice mountain tribe who knew about the hiding place of the ice army.<br/><br/>“Let’s do it!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian passed through the ice wall, he sensed that a figure was only about 5,000 meters away from him.<br/><br/>At such a distance, Wang Xian pushed his speed to the limit.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>The moment he rushed over, the old man who was sitting cross-legged in the room frowned.<br/><br/>The Futon that he was sitting on immediately emitted a glow.<br/><br/>“Die!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly when he saw the futon below him forming an ice layer to protect the old man instantly.<br/><br/>“Realm-breaking!”<br/><br/>“Dragon Eye Lock on all corners!”<br/><br/>“Five Elemental Dragon Claw!”<br/><br/>He had a bad feeling when he saw the old man protected by the ice layer. He gritted his teeth and roared softly.<br/><br/>In an instant, Wang Xian unleashed all his supernatural powers.<br/><br/>Crack! Crack! Crack<br/><br/>The realm-breaking landed on the ice layer, and cracks appeared on it.<br/><br/>The Dragon Eye Lock on all corners struck the ice layer heavily, and the cracks grew bigger and bigger.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian’s dragon claw grabbed onto the surface of the Dragon Claw, a lot of the dragon scales were destroyed instantly. However, at this moment, he could only give it his all.<br/><br/>If he couldn’t kill this person, everything would be in vain.<br/><br/>A large amount of blood seeped out from the Dragon Claw and entered the Dragon Claw with great difficulty.<br/><br/>Gritting his teeth, he used all his strength to attack the old man inside.<br/><br/>“Who are you?”<br/><br/>Only then did the old man react. Looking at the Dragon Claw that was right in front of him, he roared sternly.<br/><br/>Layers of frost were sent towards Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw.<br/><br/>“Bam!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian felt a tremendous pain coming from the Dragon Claw. He clenched his teeth and clawed at the old man in the ice.<br/><br/>“PFFT!”<br/><br/>The Dragon Claw landed on the top of the old man’s head and quickly extinguished his life force.<br/><br/>“Cough, cough, cough.”<br/><br/>He was too close to the old man. Even with the protection of the Futon, he was still unable to escape. His life force was gone.<br/><br/>“Phew, I almost died here. This futon is at least a defensive treasure at the peak of the Divine Emperor Realm. Just its passive protection almost caused me to fail.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the futon below and his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>The old man didn’t even have time to react before the FUTON he was sitting on automatically defended itself.<br/><br/>If the old man reacted and took the initiative to control the Futon, he would definitely not be able to kill the old man.<br/><br/>“As long as I kill one, the rest will be simple.”<br/><br/>He hesitated for a moment and didn’t take this futon away. He was afraid that he would trigger some traps.<br/><br/>His body moved and Wang Xian immediately flew towards the next target.<br/><br/>The next target was located on the other side of the town. He was disguised as an old man.<br/><br/>Perhaps they didn’t expect that someone would find out about their situation and attack them. This time, Wang Xian’s assassination went relatively smoothly.<br/><br/>Under his extreme speed, coupled with the power of light and darkness, he could easily kill an expert of the same level.<br/><br/>“There’s no need to worry too much from now on!”<br/><br/>Two experts of the ice troop of the level nine celestial thearch race were killed. There was nothing that could threaten him from now on.<br/><br/>He shuttled through the small town like a ghost.<br/><br/>The night was quiet. The lives of the experts of the ice troop were quickly harvested.<br/><br/>In the end, nearly 5,000 ice soldiers, all of whom were at least at the fourth level of the divine emperor realm, were all killed.<br/><br/>“Next, it’s the Icebound Army.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian muttered. He teleported and disappeared from this small town.<br/><br/>With his current understanding of the Ice Mountain race, he teleported to a very secret place.<br/><br/>“The icebound army is located on that Ice Mountain. There are hundreds of thousands of members of the icebound army and more than 10,000 of the Divine Emperor Realm.”<br/><br/>“The entire iceberg has a strong defense. However, I have figured out the way to enter over the past few days.”<br/><br/>A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face as he flew towards the Icebound Legion immediately.<br/><br/>“Oh no, something has happened to the Icebound Legion!”<br/><br/>Just as Wang Xian was flying towards the icebound legion, he was on the largest iceberg beside the icebound continent.<br/><br/>An old man saw that the divine tokens in front of him were beginning to crack. His expression changed drastically as he stood up and shouted loudly.<br/><br/>He immediately passed this news to the clan leader and the other experts in the clan.<br/><br/>The icebound army was one of the secret armies of the icebound race. There weren’t many people in the entire army, but they were all elites.<br/><br/>It was one of the trump cards of the icebound race to deter other races.<br/><br/>Now, all their trump cards had been shattered. This meant that they had been killed.<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>Very soon, terrifying figures flew out from the Ice Mountain and flew towards the frozen continent.<br/><br/>“Die!”<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian, who had already entered the location of the frozen corps, didn’t launch a sneak attack this time. Instead, he launched an all-round attack.<br/><br/>Waves of terrifying destructive power swept across the surroundings in an instant.<br/><br/>At night, many experts of the icebound army were either resting or cultivating. As the energy swept past, they died rapidly.<br/><br/>“Who is it!”<br/><br/>“Not good, someone is attacking!”<br/><br/>The expression of the expert on the iceberg where the icebound army was located changed drastically as he shouted sternly.<br/><br/>“Explode!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shouted angrily. The entire iceberg began to collapse. Only a level eight divine emperor or above could survive his attack.<br/><br/>“Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>After everything was done, his figure disappeared instantly and he returned to the Dragon Palace.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
