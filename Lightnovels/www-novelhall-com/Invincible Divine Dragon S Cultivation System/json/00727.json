With the Dragon Palace’s Dragon Field, it would not be a problem for them to level up.<br/><br/>It might not be long before they could complete the breakthrough.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>In front of them, Lan Qingyue’s level up was slowly completed.<br/><br/>She opened her eyes and looked at Wang Xian and the rest with a smile.<br/><br/>“Xiao Xian.”<br/><br/>Lan Qingyue walked over and shouted with a smile on her face!<br/><br/>“Congratulations.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded with a smile. “It seems that Xiao Lan and the rest have achieved a breakthrough.”<br/><br/>“MMM.”<br/><br/>Lan qingyue nodded. “Xiao Lan and the rest have achieved a breakthrough in the mountains and seas. Now, they can enter deeper into the mountains and seas.”<br/><br/>“Alright, tell them to pay attention to their safety. The mountains and seas are fraught with danger!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head.<br/><br/>“Congratulations, qingyue!”<br/><br/>“Sister Qingyue, isn’t your breakthrough too fast?”<br/><br/>A few girls surrounded them from the side and said enviously.<br/><br/>“You guys will achieve a breakthrough soon. I’m just lucky.”<br/><br/>Lan Qingyue said humbly.<br/><br/>She was the ancient god Feeding Kun master. Her improvement speed depended on the improvement speed of the Kun she raised.<br/><br/>The improvement speed of the Little Blue House depended on Lan Qingyue’s improvement.<br/><br/>Lan Qingyue’s improvement had no shackles at all.<br/><br/>It was not unreasonable for the ancient god Feeding Kun master to be annihilated by the peak races back then!<br/><br/>In his opinion, Wang Xian was able to obtain this opportunity. It should be left behind by the Divine Dragon Clan on Earth.<br/><br/>Similar to the Divine Dragon system, the inheritance of the ancient god Feeding Kun master, the items that gave birth to the bone dragon, and the five elements origin should all be left behind by the Divine Dragon Clan on Earth.<br/><br/>In the next few days, Wang Xian played with Lan Qingyue and the other girls for a few days.<br/><br/>Three days later, he looked at the time and left the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>He still had to participate in the Spirit Demon clan’s invitation letter and the Spirit Red Bone’s Celebration Hall!<br/><br/>The distance from the Dragon Palace to the land of the devil bones was still very far.<br/><br/>After going through the teleportation formations, Wang Xian arrived at the land of the devil bones again after more than three months!<br/><br/>“Devil?”<br/><br/>When he arrived at the land of the devil bones, he saw streaks of black rays shooting up into the sky from the direction of the Spirit Demon Clan!<br/><br/>There were a total of four streaks of black rays, which seemed to connect the earth and the void.<br/><br/>Looking from afar, it was unusually spectacular.<br/><br/>“It’s not the aftermath of the battle.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed for a moment and flew over quickly.<br/><br/>His speed was comparable to that of a level three master of the universe. In less than a few minutes, he had arrived at the territory of the spiritual demon race!<br/><br/>“This is?”<br/><br/>Floating in front of the spiritual demon race, Wang Xian stared ahead, his eyes shining.<br/><br/>A Sea of skeletons, densely packed with countless skeletons!<br/><br/>They were all skeletons, neatly arranged in an orderly manner.<br/><br/>Countless skeletons surrounded the entire spiritual demon race.<br/><br/>“This sea of skeletons is really terrifying. This should be the black vulture king’s Skeleton Army.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian guessed.<br/><br/>Wang Xian had seen the black vulture king before. Now that he thought about it, he should have the strength of a level two overlord of the universe.<br/><br/>However, the experts of the skeleton race were usually comparable to several people of the same level. Therefore, the black vulture King’s strength was not weak!<br/><br/>However, the current Wang Xian was confident that he was stronger than the black vulture king.<br/><br/>“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, you have been invited!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew towards the spiritual demon race. When he saw the flying skeleton bird hovering in the sky, he took out the invitation letter.<br/><br/>“Ka Ka, Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, Please!”<br/><br/>A skeleton bird flew over and landed under Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and stood on the skeleton bird.<br/><br/>The skeleton bird spread its wings and flew inside.<br/><br/>When he came to the depths, Wang Xian saw a tall platform built high up. There were quite a number of skeletons standing on the platform.<br/><br/>The combat strength of the skeletons here were all above the level of masters of the universe.<br/><br/>Among them, Wang Xian could sense the aura of more than a hundred skeletons at the first level of a Master of the universe, as well as an even more powerful aura.<br/><br/>In front of the platform, there were many high chairs. On the seats above, there were already many skeletons sitting!<br/><br/>Sweeping his gaze over, Wang Xian saw a familiar figure.<br/><br/>The black vulture king and the spirit demon king.<br/><br/>The black vulture king sat in the middle while the spirit demon king stood beside him.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, Welcome, Welcome!”<br/><br/>When the spirit demon king, the black vulture king, and the rest saw Wang Xian, they greeted him with smiles on their faces!<br/><br/>The black vulture king also stood up with a smile.<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>Beside the black vulture king’s seat, there were also a few tall skeletons sitting there!<br/><br/>There were golden skeletons and dark skeletons.<br/><br/>They looked at Wang Xian as the ghostly flames in their eyes throbbed slightly.<br/><br/>“Black vulture king, Spirit Demon King.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian landed in front of them and cupped his hands with a smile on his face.<br/><br/>“I dare not, I dare not. Now that you have grown to the point where I have to look up to you, Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Spirit demon king immediately smiled and said!<br/><br/>“I am friends with Red Bones, so call me uncle Spirit Demon!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and said!<br/><br/>“Haha, Good, Good!”<br/><br/>The spirit demon king smiled happily. His face was filled with excitement.<br/><br/>Because of his daughter, his status had improved a lot.<br/><br/>“Red Bones is still inside. Come out later. Dragon King, take a seat!”<br/><br/>The black vulture king smiled and gestured with his hand.<br/><br/>“Alright, I didn’t expect red bones to break through so quickly!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sat on the seat beside the black vulture king and said politely.<br/><br/>“Haha, this is all thanks to you, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The black vulture king said with a smile!<br/><br/>“HMM? This dragon king is actually sitting beside the black vulture king, sitting side by side with our King?”<br/><br/>The seats below were also filled with skeleton race experts.<br/><br/>In the entire high platform, there were more than a hundred skeleton race experts who were in the level one realm!<br/><br/>There were ten seats at the top of the platform. Excluding Wang Xian and the black vulture king, there were already skeleton kings sitting on four seats.<br/><br/>Their auras were not weaker than the black vulture king.<br/><br/>Clearly, those who could sit in this row were all at level two of the Universe Masters.<br/><br/>The fact that Wang Xian could sit there surprised some of the skeleton experts.<br/><br/>Naturally, they had heard of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. He was currently in the limelight in the heaven-splitting primordial land.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace was also known as the peak race of the future.<br/><br/>The Dragon King’s strength swept across the entire invincible region.<br/><br/>His influence and strength were extremely powerful.<br/><br/>However, in their eyes, he was merely powerful. To the high-level races, he was an invincible existence.<br/><br/>To the skeleton race, they were nothing more than that.<br/><br/>They were the powerhouses of the peak races.<br/><br/>When they saw that the Dragon King was able to sit with the black vulture king and the others, they were slightly surprised.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
