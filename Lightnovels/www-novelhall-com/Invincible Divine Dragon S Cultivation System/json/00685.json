His mouth was wide open, and his body was trembling violently!<br/><br/>His life force was disappearing at a terrifying speed!<br/><br/>His eyes were filled with disbelief!<br/><br/>He was instantly killed!<br/><br/>He was instantly killed!<br/><br/>He did not even have the strength to resist. He did not even understand why the Dragon King had set up such a terrifying formation here?<br/><br/>There were magi around?<br/><br/>Or what was the situation?<br/><br/>He died just like that!<br/><br/>He was not willing!<br/><br/>But at the same time, he was extremely terrified!<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>“How is this possible, Lord Jin Hu!”<br/><br/>“Lord Jin Hu, Lord Jin Hu!”<br/><br/>Behind them, there were more than 150 experts from the Demon Breaker Circle. When the water demon clone saw this scene, everyone’s bodies trembled violently.<br/><br/>They widened their eyes and looked at this scene in disbelief!<br/><br/>Crazy Demon Jin Xu, their Lord Jin Xu, was one of the top existences in the invincible zone.<br/><br/>The strongest among them was actually killed in an instant!<br/><br/>Killed in an instant, he didn’t even have the ability to dodge!<br/><br/>What kind of power was this?<br/><br/>That terrifying array came from there. How could the Dragon King’s attack be so terrifying!<br/><br/>If Lord Jin Xu was killed, why were they still resisting the Demonic Dragon King?<br/><br/>“Next, it’s Your Turn!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian killed Jin Xu. He could sense that Jin Xu was not completely dead yet. He was resurrected somewhere else!<br/><br/>However, he was no longer a threat to him now!<br/><br/>He shook his dragon body and flapped his incorporeal holy wings. He stared at the group of experts in the Demon Breaker’s circle with a cold expression on his face!<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>In an instant, Wang Xian, who was at his maximum speed, dashed to the front of the group of experts in the Demon Breaker’s Circle!<br/><br/>He locked his gaze on the Void Temple Immortal and the group of experts around him and charged straight at them!<br/><br/>“Not good, Attack!”<br/><br/>“Attack the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>When the Void Temple immortal saw Wang Xian charging over, his body trembled violently as he roared in horror!<br/><br/>From the side, Bao Hu and the rest of the experts from the Demon Breaker Circle looked over. Their expressions changed drastically!<br/><br/>Their Lord Jin Xu was dead. It was impossible for them to kill the Dragon King!<br/><br/>“Huala!”<br/><br/>“Whoosh!”<br/><br/>At this moment, water demon, who was at the side, saw this scene. His body moved and he flew backward!<br/><br/>He didn’t hesitate at all and didn’t stop at all!<br/><br/>He knew the outcome of this battle after seeing that Jin Fu was killed!<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>“Lord Water Demon!”<br/><br/>“Water demon has escaped!”<br/><br/>The experts in the Demon Breaker’s circle who were following water demon shouted in shock and anger when they saw water demon leaving!<br/><br/>Once water demon left, they were even less qualified to fight him!<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>The escape of the water demon caused Wang Xian to raise his eyebrows.<br/><br/>“I’ll kill all of You First!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at the experts of the Void Temple. The Tai Chi Dragon was spinning and the five elements millstone was floating in the air!<br/><br/>Faced with the attacks of the thirty to forty experts of the Void Temple, he charged straight at them!<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>Wang Xian broke through their attacks and arrived at a distance of about 100,000 kilometers away from them!<br/><br/>This distance was too close!<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements grinding mill enveloped the area above them!<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, four Netherworld avatars surrounded them completely at the same time!<br/><br/>Four Netherworld avatars. Each of them was comparable to an expert at the level of the Void Temple Immortal. Each of them was comparable to an existence at the level of the ruler of the universe!<br/><br/>Furthermore, the combined forces of the Void Temple Immortal and the rest could only deal with three netherspirit avatars at most!<br/><br/>Under such circumstances, how were they supposed to defend against Wang Immortal’s attack?<br/><br/>They were crushed by his immense strength!<br/><br/>“Bao Hu, save us!”<br/><br/>The void temple immortal’s body trembled violently when he saw the unstoppable attack of the Dragon King. He roared in a stern voice!<br/><br/>“Save us?”<br/><br/>Bao Hu’s expression changed drastically. His gaze swept across the experts around him.<br/><br/>The experts from the demon breaker circle looked at each other.<br/><br/>“We are not a match for the Dragon King. Run!”<br/><br/>An expert behind Bao Hu roared loudly!<br/><br/>He did not hesitate at all as he also ran back!<br/><br/>His actions had opened the door for the other experts!<br/><br/>Now, they all understood that they were no longer a match for the Dragon King with Lord Jin Yu dead and the water demon escaping!<br/><br/>They might even be killed if they stayed here!<br/><br/>When one of them escaped, the group of experts around Bao Hu immediately fled without any hesitation!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>However, just as they were about to escape, a spell formation enveloped them!<br/><br/>The water demon fled very quickly. Wu Sha, who was hiding in the dark, had just finished casting the spell formation and had no chance of stopping it!<br/><br/>However, the rest of the experts were too late!<br/><br/>Numerous extremely powerful spell formations enveloped them!<br/><br/>They were completely surrounded!<br/><br/>The dozens of experts who wanted to escape were instantly enveloped by the Black Fog!<br/><br/>In the depths of the fog, terrifying and sinister snake heads were revealed!<br/><br/>“Not good, there are Magi in the dark and spell formation magi. They are extremely powerful!”<br/><br/>When Bao Hu saw the formation that suddenly rose, his heart beat violently.<br/><br/>If there wasn’t a formation that suddenly attacked Lord Jin Xu, Lord Jin Xu might not have been killed in an instant!<br/><br/>And a formation that could knock Lord Jin Xu’s innate treasure away, the strength of the Magus behind it was absolutely terrifying!<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a miserable cry sounded from the side!<br/><br/>“Ghost Clone, Ghost clone. Dragon King, how can you have a ghost clone? How is this possible?”<br/><br/>“AH, escape, escape. This Dragon King’s strength is too terrifying. It’s unstoppable!”<br/><br/>Terrified voices were heard continuously.<br/><br/>From the Void Temple Immortal’s side, a scream was heard!<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the illusory palace above the Void Temple Immortal’s Head had almost solidified. In the palace, the spells and Dao Arts were attacking Wang Xian!<br/><br/>However, they couldn’t break through Wang Xian’s defense at all!<br/><br/>The eyes of the Void Temple immortal were filled with despair!<br/><br/>He was doomed!<br/><br/>He couldn’t escape!<br/><br/>They couldn’t return to their divine kingdom in an instant here. They were doomed!<br/><br/>“Dragon Breath of Life!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian let out a low growl. Terrifying Wood attribute attacks were launched at the Void Temple Immortal and the rest of the experts!<br/><br/>This attack caused the dozens of experts of the Void Temple immortal and the rest to feel despair in an instant!<br/><br/>“Demon Breaker’s Circle? None of you can escape!”<br/><br/>The thirty to forty experts around the Void Temple immortal were left with only seven to eight experts under the attacks of the ghost avatar and Wang Xian!<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements Millstone flew out and attacked Bao Hu and the rest of the experts!<br/><br/>At the same time, Wang Xian didn’t bother with the seven to eight experts. He handed them over to the Netherworld Phantom avatar with ease!<br/><br/>Bao Hu and the other experts around him had just been enveloped by the formation.<br/><br/>Before they could break the formation, they saw the supreme treasure and the Dragon King, which contained the aura of death, attacking them. This caused them to hold their breaths!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
