This sculpture has a great attraction to you?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the female snake and raised his eyebrows slightly.<br/><br/>“Yes, Dragon King. This sculpture has a great attraction and pressure to me. The image of this sculpture is very similar to… to our Creator.”<br/><br/>The female snake’s expression changed as she spoke.<br/><br/>“Creator?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was astonished when he heard her words.<br/><br/>Creator? He had heard such a powerful title before.<br/><br/>What kind of existence dared to call himself a creator?<br/><br/>“Yes. According to the records of our Sheji race, we were created by the Creator. The Creator is an omnipotent existence.”<br/><br/>“She has a human body and a dragon tail. She is the supreme existence and a powerful ancestral witch in the universe. She created our Sheji race and gave us life.”<br/><br/>The female snake said with slight respect.<br/><br/>“Ancestral Wizard?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly when he heard her words.<br/><br/>The wizard lineage was a very powerful and heaven-defying lineage. They were a different kind of scientists.<br/><br/>They studied formations, studied sorcery, and studied bloodlines and constitutions.<br/><br/>However, the wizard lineage could be divided into two directions.<br/><br/>One was the direction of the formation.<br/><br/>The other was the direction of the bloodline constitution.<br/><br/>The formation was the current direction of the Sky Formation.<br/><br/>As for the bloodline constitution, it was more inclined towards close combat.<br/><br/>They used powerful and strange witchcraft to modify their bloodlines and even modify their bodies.<br/><br/>They transferred the limbs of powerful existences onto their own bodies.<br/><br/>They could transform themselves into terrifying monsters.<br/><br/>In order to pursue extreme combat strength, there were even wizards who joined the limbs of various powerful creatures onto their own bodies.<br/><br/>The Ancestral Wizard was the pinnacle of the Wizards, and the Ancestral Wizard’s strength was the corresponding ruler of the universe.<br/><br/>If one were to say that the Snake Belle tribe was created by an ancestral wizard, it was really possible.<br/><br/>It was not impossible for a powerful ancestral wizard to build a tribe that could fight above their level through their powerful abilities.<br/><br/>“A statue shouldn’t be so strange. Now that I have the combat strength of a level four universe knight, it is very difficult for a statue to kill a level four universe knight unwittingly.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>A statue of the creator of the Snake Princess clan. Although an ancestral wizard was extremely terrifying, a statue of him wouldn’t have such a strange ability.<br/><br/>“Sky Formation.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and transmitted his voice to the sky formation.<br/><br/>“Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Soon, the Sky Formation flew over and bowed to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Take a look and see if this thing is a powerful magic tool.”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, he raised the statue in his hand and said to him.<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>The heaven’s formation looked over and his pupils narrowed slightly. His eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>His body moved and came in front of Wang Xian. He touched it with his hand.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, this… This might not be a statue or a magic tool.”<br/><br/>The Heaven’s formation spoke with a grave tone.<br/><br/>“HMM? Then what is this?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at him in astonishment.<br/><br/>“This might be a corpse.”<br/><br/>Tian Chen said with a contemplative look on his face, “According to the information I’ve read about wizards, I’ve seen something similar.”<br/><br/>“Bloodline and physique wizards, their path of cultivation is to transform and strengthen themselves, turning their bodies into the most powerful and bizarre existence.”<br/><br/>“After the death of bloodline and physique wizards, their bodies will become the most powerful wizard tools. This sculpture should be a corpse.”<br/><br/>As Tian Chen spoke, his face was filled with affirmation.<br/><br/>“It’s actually a corpse.”<br/><br/>“No Wonder, no wonder it’s So Bizarre.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was slightly surprised as he sized it up carefully.<br/><br/>A surge of energy entered the sculpture. He could sense the dragon’s blood and other energies inside.<br/><br/>“Is this the body that the ancestral wizard modified himself? Even if he’s dead, the energy inside didn’t disappear.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he spoke.<br/><br/>Moreover, was this ancestral wizard completely dead?<br/><br/>It was really extremely strange.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. Suddenly, he looked at the black branch on the ancestral tree behind him.<br/><br/>That Black Branch was formed from the forbidden art, the heaven-pilfering pulse changing technique.<br/><br/>Now, this branch also possessed the ability to do the same.<br/><br/>Suddenly, he had an idea.<br/><br/>“Why don’t I let the members of the Dolphin clan try it out?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and decided to give it a try. Even if the members of the Dolphin clan died, they could still be revived.<br/><br/>However, if he succeeded, perhaps the dragon palace would be able to give birth to a powerful dragon seed.<br/><br/>After all, this was the bloodline and physique of the ancestral wizard.<br/><br/>“Prime Minister Gui, go and call a member of the Dolphin clan to conduct an experiment. Get Her to come to the dragon transformation pool.”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, he waved his arm and brought the female snake to the front of the dragon transformation pool in an instant.<br/><br/>The Heaven Formation also moved and followed behind.<br/><br/>Soon, the leader of the Dolphin clan and a member of the Dolphin clan flew over.<br/><br/>Wang Xian placed the branch filled with symbols on the ancestral witch’s corpse and placed the other end of the branch on the member of the Dolphin clan.<br/><br/>“Enter the dragon transformation pool and see if there are any changes.”<br/><br/>He instructed.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The member of the Dolphin clan replied immediately and flew into the pool.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>When she entered the dragon transformation pool, Wang Xian instantly felt the black symbols on the branch start to move.<br/><br/>Waves of energy slowly surged into the member of the Dolphin clan.<br/><br/>Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly as he watched. After confirming that there was no danger, he waited quietly for the news.<br/><br/>“Ding! A new dragon species has been born in the Dragon Palace, the charming dragon species. Congratulations, host!”<br/><br/>“Ding! Due to energy reasons, the dragon palace can only nurture 1,000 charming dragon species!”<br/><br/>An hour later, the system’s voice rang out suddenly.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard the notification, a glint flashed across his eyes.<br/><br/>“Success!”<br/><br/>A smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>What was the grade of the charming dragons?<br/><br/>They could only nurture 1,000 species of charming dragons, so the level of the charming dragons should not be low.<br/><br/>“It might also be a peak dragon species. It’s a pity that the number is a little low.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled as he looked at the dragon transformation pool expectantly.<br/><br/>Time flew by quickly. Wang Xian stood at the dragon transformation pool for more than ten hours.<br/><br/>“Huala!”<br/><br/>After more than ten hours, Wang Xian realized that the Dolphins inside had undergone a huge change.<br/><br/>They had a human body and a dragon tail. There was also a hint of a strange aura on their bodies.<br/><br/>Their long wavy hair was exceptionally beautiful. Every move they made was soul-stirring.<br/><br/>She had dark red eyes. When she looked into his eyes, she felt that it was extremely strange.<br/><br/>“This… This Is?”<br/><br/>At the side, the female snake looked at the figure in the dragon transformation pool with a shocked expression on her face.<br/><br/>“Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The newly promoted charming dragon flew over and greeted Wang Xian with a smile.<br/><br/>“How many levels higher can you fight?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian squinted his eyes and asked expectantly.<br/><br/>“Level three, a peak dragon species.”<br/><br/>The Mei Long replied with excitement in its eyes.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
