Your breakthrough will cause a huge change in the energy of Heaven and earth. It will cause some conflict with the water source. Let’s do it in the sky above the grassland.” Wang Xian thought for a moment and said!<br/><br/>“Alright then, I’ll listen to you, Foster Father! ”<br/><br/>Tianci nodded and had no objections!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, the last time I set up a demonic altar in the Earth City, Pll teleport to the Earth City! ”<br/><br/>An lie said to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded. “Let’s Go! ”<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>An lie swept his gaze across everyone. With a wave of his arm, a wave of energy enveloped them!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>In the next instant, they appeared at the six paths universe’s original land city.<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed the suppression from the six paths universe and a thought came to his mind.<br/><br/>The same root was connected to Tianci’s body and to the disciples of the Dragon Palace. The suppression from the six paths universe vanished instantly.<br/><br/>When the suppression disappeared, the thirteen divine dragons of the Dragon Palace rose into the sky.<br/><br/>Dragon Roar!<br/><br/>At the same time, the power of a peak-level universe dominator surged into the surroundings.<br/><br/>This time, all the peak-level universe Dominators of the Dragon Palace had arrived.<br/><br/>A total of 18!<br/><br/>With the corpses of the Heavenly Yuan creation realm experts, the disciples of the Dragon Palace improved very quickly.<br/><br/>Over the past 200 million years, more than 10 peak-level universe Dominators had been added.<br/><br/>The reason why they came this time was firstly to give the future heavenly bestowal a boost.<br/><br/>The other reason was for the Heaven’s origin realm to achieve a breakthrough. This would also allow the disciples of the Dragon Palace to gain some insights.<br/><br/>The next biggest hurdle for them was the Heaven’s origin realm!<br/><br/>“Let’s Go! ”<br/><br/>The 13 divine dragons roared and hovered in the air.<br/><br/>A dragon chair appeared behind them. Wang Xian was sitting on a huge dragon chair.<br/><br/>Beside him was a small dragon chair. Ling tianci sat on it.<br/><br/>Behind him was ao Qitian and the rest who were wrapping mu Liyin c er and the rest with energy.<br/><br/>As divine dragons who were at the peak of the Dragon Palace’s overlord realm, their status was very high.<br/><br/>Apart from those in the Tianyuan blessed realm, they were the strongest experts at this level.<br/><br/>Tianci was about to break through to the Tianyuan blessed realm. He was also the Crown Prince of the Dragon Palace. The group of divine dragons who were at the peak of the Overlord Realm pulled him along. Naturally, they were convinced.<br/><br/>As for the rest, they would not let him sit on the dragon throne.<br/><br/>In the Dragon Palace, strength was king. Only the Dragon Queen and the future crown prince and Princess had the right to be pulled and brought along by them.<br/><br/>This was also the rule of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>The thirteen Divine Dragons roared and pulled Wang Xian and the rest in a direction at a fast speed!<br/><br/>In Earth City, the sudden roar of the divine dragons and the sudden terrifying power caused all the strong disciples in earth city to be slightly shocked.<br/><br/>Especially the powerful warriors of the Black Earth tribe in Earth City.<br/><br/>When they sensed this power, they immediately floated to the sky, their faces full of shock.<br/><br/>“What is this?”<br/><br/>“Dragon God, it’s a dragon God, a dragon God from the nine-origin Universe Dragon Palace. This power is all at the peak of the ruler level! ”<br/><br/>“It’s a dragon God, similar to that Dragon King. Look behind that Dragon God, there’s a throne, and that’s the Dragon King, and Mu Litian! ”<br/><br/>“Hiss, what terrifying power. These thirteen divine dragons are too terrifying. Not only are there thirteen divine dragons, but there are also five existences at the peak of the ruler realm. Are these the subordinates of the nine-origin Universe Dragon King?”<br/><br/>“Why did the Dragon King and the others suddenly come back? And Mu Litianci has returned from the nine-origin universe? What’s going on?” “Immediately report to our Lord Tianyuan Creation! ”<br/><br/>The experts of the Black Earth tribe discussed in shock. They stared at the enormous and majestic divine dragon in the sky in shock and fear.<br/><br/>Especially the dragon throne behind the Divine Dragon.<br/><br/>Pulling a chariot with a peak-stage ruler realm existence, this power shook the ancient and modern times!<br/><br/>And a person from their six-path universe was sitting at the back.<br/><br/>These ten or so peak-stage rulers were more powerful than the experts of their black Earth tribe!<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Somewhere in the Xuan Tu tribe, Tu Sha City opened his eyes. A look of surprise appeared on his face.<br/><br/>He moved and instantly floated in the sky above the Earth City.<br/><br/>This was one of his clones.<br/><br/>When this clone of Tu Sha City saw Wang Xian and the rest in the sky, his eyes flickered slightly. His pupils were filled with fear.<br/><br/>“Welcome, Dragon King. Tianci is back as well?”<br/><br/>Tu Sha City approached Wang Xian and the rest and greeted, “Dragon King, where are you guys going this time?”<br/><br/>“Tianci is going to the grassland for a breakthrough. I will accompany him there. If you are interested, brother Tu, you can take a look. Hehe! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled faintly at Tu Sha City and said!<br/><br/>Following that, he looked at the group of Divine Dragons.<br/><br/>The Divine Dragons roared and pulled their dragon chairs as they flew rapidly towards the direction of the grassland! “They broke through so quickly?”<br/><br/>Tulsa city was shocked as he looked at the departing figures ot Wang Xian and the rest with a twinkle in his eyes.<br/><br/>“He is my nephew, Mu Litianci, from the six paths universe. He is about to advance to the Tianyuan destiny realm in the grassland. He is about to add a Tianyuan destiny saint to the six paths universe. He is the godson of the Dragon King from the nine paths universe. Mu Litianci is about to step into the<br/><br/>Tianyuan Destiny Realm! ”<br/><br/>The Earth City opened its mouth, and the voice formed by majestic energy spread across the entire earth city and to other places in the Earth Region!<br/><br/>“Oh? Lord Mu Li Tianci is going to break through, hiss, so fast, this is too fast!<br/><br/>“Wow, our six paths universe is going to have one more heavenly yuan destiny realm expert, Mu Li Tianci is going to break through in the grassland, quick, quick, let’s go and take a look, the Heavenly Yuan Destiny Realm Expert has advanced! ”<br/><br/>“This is really heaven-defying. Mu Litianci was born as a destiny saint, and the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace protected him and raised him. Now, in just over 300 million years, he has become a heavenly yuan destiny realm expert. This is too terrifying!”<br/><br/>(‘F * ck, with a Heavenly Yuan destiny realm expert and the powerful Dragon King of the Dragon Palace as a father, if I had such a father, I might have reached the heavenly yuan destiny realm. At that time, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was here in Earth City. It was simply too heaven-defying. He killed other heavenly yuan destiny realm experts randomly! ”<br/><br/>The entire Earth city was in an uproar.<br/><br/>Countless powerful disciples were discussing, and they were all extremely excited.<br/><br/>The six paths universe now had a great existence.<br/><br/>And Mu Litianci would also become a legend in the six paths universe.<br/><br/>The luckiest person!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
