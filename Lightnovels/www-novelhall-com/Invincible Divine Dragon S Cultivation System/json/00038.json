Even if there was really any danger, they could still escape.<br/><br/>Secondly, although the Dragon Palace had offended the ancient rare tribe and the brain spirit tribe, the other party might not dare to deal with them.<br/><br/>Moreover, God Emperor Hong Tian had established a tribe. At this time, all the powers that came would give him face and would not cause trouble at this time.<br/><br/>However, what Wang Xian did not know was that the matter of him killing the disciple of God Emperor Hong Tian had already been known.<br/><br/>Furthermore, an arrest warrant had been issued.<br/><br/>However, the arrest warrant was limited to the inner circle of Celestial Emperor Hong Tian’s disciples and grand-disciples. It was not made public.<br/><br/>This was also to prevent Wang Xian and the rest from announcing the method to enter the Divine Garden Star. Hence, there was no arrest warrant issued on the AI.<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. The day of the establishment of the Red Mist race was approaching.<br/><br/>“Welcome, elders of the Sky Flame race. Thank you for coming.”<br/><br/>“Welcome, clan leader of the Type Moon race. Thank you, clan leader of the Type Moon race, for coming personally.”<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Half a month later, on a planet in the center of the Mohan clan’s ruins, in the starry sky, many extremely powerful races rushed over.<br/><br/>There were experts of the sky flame race whose entire bodies were emitting flames. They were like fire gods.<br/><br/>There were experts who sat on divine artifacts like the crescent moon.<br/><br/>There were also experts who rode on various mounts.<br/><br/>Each group of them emitted a terrifying aura.<br/><br/>Any team would have at least a rank seven divine emperor to guard it.<br/><br/>In the sky, experts from the Red Fog clan who wore black and red clothes welcomed these races with smiles.<br/><br/>Today was the Red Mist Race’s grand ceremony.<br/><br/>Half a month ago, the Red Mist race had invited all the major powers.<br/><br/>For a domain level race that had just been established, and it was a force in this starry sky, they naturally had to go over and get to know them.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether it was to build a good relationship or to investigate the details.<br/><br/>The birth of a domain level race would definitely attract the attention of the various major powers.<br/><br/>The weaker races and domain-level races even sent their top-notch experts over with gifts.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, there are quite a number of experts here. As far as the eye can see, they are all the top-notch experts in this starry sky.”<br/><br/>In front of the planet of the red fog race, the eight-limbed demon fiend of the Heaven Formation followed Wang Xian. He scanned the surroundings and transmitted his voice.<br/><br/>“The establishment of a force by a wizard at the peak of the celestial thearch is quite a sensation here. It has been almost a billion years since a domain-level race was born in this void domain!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled as he recalled the information he had read from the universe’s artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>It was not that simple to leap from a race to a domain-level race.<br/><br/>At least, there had to be two powerhouses at the ninth level of the celestial thearch.<br/><br/>The second was the foundation.<br/><br/>There were only a dozen domain-level races around the ruins of the Mohan clan. Among them, there were only four domain-level races that were relatively stronger.<br/><br/>These four domain-level races had peak celestial thearch powerhouses overseeing them.<br/><br/>The strength of a faction represented the amount of resources that they could share.<br/><br/>The rise of a powerful faction in a starry sky had a considerable impact on the surrounding factions.<br/><br/>“Everyone, may I know which faction you are from?”<br/><br/>In the void of the planet, a rank five divine emperor Magus swept his gaze across Wang Xian and the rest. A glint flashed in his eyes as he immediately went forward to greet them and asked with a smile.<br/><br/>“Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>Ba Qi said faintly.<br/><br/>“Oh? It’s actually the members of the Dragon Palace. Please come in, please come in!”<br/><br/>The Red Fog clan’s powerhouse revealed a look of surprise and immediately extended his hand to signal.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, this guy should have recognized us. He’s putting on an Act!”<br/><br/>Mo Sha looked at the expert from the Red Fog clan and transmitted his voice to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly.<br/><br/>“Lead the way!”<br/><br/>Ba Qi continued.<br/><br/>“Oh? Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>“Are they from the Dragon Palace? How dare they come?”<br/><br/>“It seems like God Emperor Hong Tian has also invited the Dragon Palace on the Universal Ai. Why don’t they dare to come? Many powerful forces are afraid of the Dragon Palace Now!”<br/><br/>“This is the first time I’ve seen the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace. Do they have the bloodline of the Divine Dragon? is the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace Here?”<br/><br/>“This is the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>The words of the Wizard from the Red Mist clan immediately attracted the attention of the surrounding people. Some of them looked over with curious and astonished expressions.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace was not unknown in this void. Its terrifying assassination methods made all the races fearful.<br/><br/>When they saw Wang Xian and the rest, the experts from the surrounding factions were filled with curiosity.<br/><br/>“Dragon Palace, are they from the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>At the same time, at the back, more than 20 experts flew over.<br/><br/>They had huge heads, four limbs, and a frail body. Their eyes were filled with killing intent as they looked at Wang Xian and the rest.<br/><br/>These more than 20 people were experts from the brain spirit race.<br/><br/>This was the first time they had seen an expert from the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>It was a little depressing.<br/><br/>The other party had already assassinated 2,000 of their celestial emperors.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest, who were heading towards the planet below, sensed the killing intent from behind and turned their heads to look.<br/><br/>“Keke Keke!”<br/><br/>When the eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest saw the race with the huge head, they immediately recognized it.<br/><br/>They placed their hands on their necks and touched it provocatively before turning their heads.<br/><br/>“Hehe!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian also smiled faintly.<br/><br/>The current Dragon Palace didn’t put the brain spirit race in their eyes at all.<br/><br/>If they weren’t afraid that the other party would fight to the death, or if they weren’t afraid of arousing the resentment of the other factions, they would already have the power to destroy the brain spirit race.<br/><br/>“That Dragon Palace’s people are so arrogant!”<br/><br/>Some of the surrounding races were paying attention to the situation here. When they saw the eight-limbed demon fiend and the others’provocative gestures, they said in a low voice.<br/><br/>“This dragon palace also has the confidence to be arrogant. A force in a remote starry sky has been revealed to have a quasi-dragon and a divine dragon. Many forces are coveting it, but now it’s actually making all the forces fear it. They are very powerful.”<br/><br/>Some of the powerhouses from the factions were discussing.<br/><br/>“Everyone from the Dragon Palace, this way please!”<br/><br/>The Red Fog clan powerhouse who was leading the way smiled and led the way.<br/><br/>Around them, some of the red fog clan powerhouses looked over with sparkling eyes.<br/><br/>Soon, the news of Wang Xian’s arrival reached the hands of the Red Fog clan powerhouses.<br/><br/>Good News! The people from the Dragon Palace have arrived!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
