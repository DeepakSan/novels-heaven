He cupped his hands and bowed.<br/><br/>It was for no other reason than the fact that Lei Yu was older than him due to his kindness!<br/><br/>He chuckled in his heart. He didn’t care too much about this.<br/><br/>“Hehe.”<br/><br/>The leader of the Thunder Ray tribe and the rest looked at Wang Xian with a hint of shock in their eyes.<br/><br/>“Yuntian, Wang Xian, come with us!”<br/><br/>As the leader of the Thunder Ray Tribe spoke, he waved his arm. A bolt of lightning appeared under their bodies and flew towards the main hall.<br/><br/>The grand elder at the side followed.<br/><br/>“In the future, Wang Xian’s disciple will be your eldest senior brother, the leader of the disciples. According to the rules of the Thunder Ray tribe, we must obey the orders of our eldest senior brother!”<br/><br/>When the great elder saw the tribe leader leaving with Wang Xian and Lei Yuntian, he swept his gaze across the surrounding disciples and said.<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>All the disciples were shocked and immediately responded.<br/><br/>“Don’t be discouraged and don’t feel defeated. The Talent of your eldest senior brother, Wang Xian, is unique even among all the peak tribes.”<br/><br/>The great elder looked at them and added.<br/><br/>The Great Elder was really afraid that his disciples would be defeated.<br/><br/>After all, Wang Xian’s age was considered to be the smallest among all the disciples of the Lightning race.<br/><br/>To be able to be their eldest senior brother at such a young age, this was a huge blow!<br/><br/>After the great elder finished his sentence, he left immediately. The group of elders followed behind him.<br/><br/>“Senior brother Wang Xian actually won. Furthermore, he won so easily. Even the clan leader and the great elder have such a high evaluation of senior brother Wang Xian. This is simply heaven-defying!”<br/><br/>“That’s right. Who would have thought that senior brother Lei Yuntian would actually lose? In the future, senior brother Wang Xian will be our eldest senior brother!”<br/><br/>“The Great Elder’s evaluation is too high. It’s good that Wang Xian has become our eldest senior brother. He is even willing to guide our disciples. I heard that he has captured quite a number of desolate beasts and given them to the clan!”<br/><br/>“That’s amazing. I want to target eldest senior brother Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>The group of disciples were discussing in astonishment when they saw the clan leader and elders leaving.<br/><br/>In the main hall of the Thunder Ray tribe, the tribe leader brought Wang Xian and the rest over and spoke to him directly.<br/><br/>“Oh? Thank you, Tribe Leader!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He hesitated for a moment and did not reject him. He nodded his head slightly.<br/><br/>“Second Supreme Elder, please bring him to the treasure vault of our tribe.”<br/><br/>The tribe leader of the Thunder Ray Tribe said to the supreme elder beside him.<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>The second supreme elder nodded his head. His gaze landed on Wang Xian and a smile appeared on his face. “Let’s go.”<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian immediately cupped his hands.<br/><br/>“Take out that Dragon Pearl and let him choose!”<br/><br/>All of a sudden, the leader of the Lightning race transmitted his voice to the second Supreme Elder.<br/><br/>The second supreme elder paused for a moment and nodded his head at the leader of the Lightning race.<br/><br/>He waved his arm and brought Wang Xian to the back.<br/><br/>They flew all the way to the back. Soon, they entered a small thunder cloud.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian felt a sense of terror in this thunder cloud.<br/><br/>He felt his heart palpitating.<br/><br/>“Hehe, this is where our thunder ray tribe’s treasure house is located. It is located in an offensive grotto-heaven blessed land.”<br/><br/>When the second supreme elder saw Wang Xian’s expression, he smiled, he continued, “The offensive power of this grotto-heaven blessed land can easily kill a powerhouse at the peak of the Universe Knight Realm. Furthermore, the first Supreme Elder is holding an innate spiritual treasure to guard this place.”<br/><br/>“Innate spiritual treasure!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard the second Supreme Elder’s words, his face was slightly shocked.<br/><br/>“Hehe, let’s Go!”<br/><br/>The second supreme elder smiled and entered an entrance in front.<br/><br/>“First Supreme Elder, the clan leader has informed you, right?”<br/><br/>He walked to the entrance and shouted directly.<br/><br/>“HMM, let me take a look at this purebred divine dragon disciple!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a figure instantly appeared in front of Wang Xian. He sized him up and clicked his tongue in wonder. “Impressive, impressive. The youngsters nowadays are really impressive. Let’s go in!”<br/><br/>“Thank you, first Supreme Elder!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the slightly aged elder and cupped his hands.<br/><br/>“Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>The second supreme elder placed his palm in front of the metal door at the entrance. The door to the Treasury opened and brought him in.<br/><br/>After passing through a passage filled with lightning, Wang Xian and the rest came straight to a stone chamber filled with lightning.<br/><br/>There were some treasures placed in the stone chamber. Each of them contained a tremendous amount of power.<br/><br/>There were not many treasures. There were only about twenty of them. Most of them were acquired treasures of the Lightning attribute.<br/><br/>“There is one more treasure. The clan leader has given you permission to choose. Of course, if you really can’t use it, don’t choose!”<br/><br/>Beside him, the second Supreme Elder said as he dripped a drop of blood onto a ball in the middle.<br/><br/>The spot in front of him instantly became illusory.<br/><br/>He stretched out his hand and grabbed, and a universal box appeared in his hand.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard his words and saw the box in his hand, he was slightly shocked.<br/><br/>A strong attractive force was transmitted over, and his eyes instantly emitted a strong luster.<br/><br/>“This is…”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this scene, his breathing became a little hurried.<br/><br/>“This is one of the most precious treasures of our thunder ray race. It is comparable to an innate spiritual treasure. As it does not match the attributes of our thunder ray race, it has been placed here all this while.”<br/><br/>As the second elder of the Thunder Ray race spoke, his gaze landed on Wang Xian. “This is a divine weapon that belongs to the Divine Dragon, the Dragon Pearl!”<br/><br/>As he spoke, he slowly opened it and a blazing flame burst out.<br/><br/>Under the burning flame, cracks appeared in the surrounding void. It was extremely terrifying.<br/><br/>“A dragon pearl of the Universe Dominator level!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian widened his eyes and said with a face full of shock.<br/><br/>“Yes, a dragon pearl at the level of the Master of the universe should be at the first level of the Master of the universe. It is definitely comparable to an innate numinous treasure. It is even more precious than an innate numinous treasure to a fire element cultivator.”<br/><br/>The second supreme elder said solemnly.<br/><br/>“This… This is too valuable!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian opened his mouth and looked at the second supreme elder of the Thunder Ray tribe.<br/><br/>“Hehe, the clan leader has made an exception to let you choose. If it is useful to you, you can choose it. If it is not useful, don’t choose it. To us, the Lightning race, this is also a treasure!”<br/><br/>The second supreme elder smiled and said.<br/><br/>A Dragon Pearl of the universe dominator level was indeed a treasure to the lightning race. Even if they could not use it, they could still exchange it for a huge amount of resources in exchange for an innate spiritual treasure.<br/><br/>The reason why the Lightning race gave it to Wang Xian to choose was because they saw his potential. They wanted to let Wang Xian know that the lightning race treated him well.<br/><br/>This could be said to be a bet. They bet that Wang Xian would become a powerful existence in the future and would definitely know how to be grateful.<br/><br/>“Second Supreme Elder, this fire dragon pearl is of great use to me. I, Wang Xian, will definitely return the favor of the Lightning race tenfold in the future!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the fire dragon bead and said gratefully to the second Supreme Elder.<br/><br/>With this fire dragon bead, his five elements grinding could be improved once again.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
