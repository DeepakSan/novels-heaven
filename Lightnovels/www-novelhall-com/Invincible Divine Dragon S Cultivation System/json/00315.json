The Strong Preyed On The Weak</h1><div class=\"entry-content\" id=\"htmlContent\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3306 3305. The strong preyed on the weak<br/><br/>Scorpion imperial city was a city shrouded in a poisonous fog. In this city, if there was no poison fog antibody or antidote, even a first level void God realm expert would not be able to survive here.<br/><br/>The entire Scorpion Imperial City’s air was filled with corrosive power.<br/><br/>“TSK tsk, some places in this heaven opening primal continent are indeed mystical.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled.<br/><br/>Such a place was not suitable for ordinary creatures to live in. Even if ordinary members of the Dragon Clan were to come here, their combat strength would drop a little.<br/><br/>“According to the records in the universe’s AI, every city in the Lich Kingdom is built on a small paradise. is the paradise here related to poison?”<br/><br/>He mumbled and continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>Half an hour later, he noticed signs of biological activity in the surroundings.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>All of a sudden, he sensed a blood trail spreading towards him.<br/><br/>This made him squint his eyes slightly and continue to walk forward.<br/><br/>“Catch him!”<br/><br/>When the blood trail came to Wang Xian’s feet, three voices suddenly sounded. He sensed three figures covered in a bloody poisonous fog attacking him.<br/><br/>The blood veins under his body rose up directly and formed a poisonous net that enveloped Wang Xian completely.<br/><br/>“A direct ambush?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and swept his gaze over.<br/><br/>There were three liches. One of them had a human head and a lizard-like body.<br/><br/>His body was completely integrated with the surrounding environment.<br/><br/>One of them had a pair of wings. On his head, there were dozens of pairs of eyes.<br/><br/>The last one was like a giant python. It was over 10,000 meters long and was sweeping towards him.<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at the creature that was attacking him. His eyes revealed a cold look.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>“Huh? Not Good!”<br/><br/>The Lich with dozens of pairs of eyes had a slight change in expression. He immediately roared in a low voice.<br/><br/>“You’re courting death!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian saw his strong alertness and revealed a surprised expression.<br/><br/>He waved his arm and the energy of the five elements directly restrained him.<br/><br/>“My Lord, spare my life! Spare my life!”<br/><br/>The three liches who were subdued in an instant saw this scene and their expressions changed drastically. They begged for mercy in horror.<br/><br/>“Soul capture!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s gaze focused as the three liches trembled.<br/><br/>Waves of information were transmitted into his mind.<br/><br/>As he absorbed this information, his eyes were sparkling.<br/><br/>“This heaven-splitting and primal continent is even crueler than the outside world!”<br/><br/>After more than ten minutes, he opened his eyes slowly and mumbled.<br/><br/>According to his understanding, these three fellows wanted to ambush and kill him.<br/><br/>And the reason was because the lich with the human head wanted his head.<br/><br/>It was that simple.<br/><br/>He wanted his head.<br/><br/>In the Lich Kingdom, the Lich clan had two ways of training.<br/><br/>One was to walk the path of pure witchcraft, in terms of magic.<br/><br/>But the Lich clan had more of the other.<br/><br/>They hunted powerful creatures and transferred the creature’s head, wings, tail, and eyes to their own bodies.<br/><br/>Through this method, they could strengthen themselves.<br/><br/>This was another way to strengthen one’s witchcraft. It was also the second path for Wizards.<br/><br/>This path was as powerful as pure witchcraft.<br/><br/>However, in order to reach the level of ancestral wizard, one’s physical body and witchcraft had to reach a terrifying level.<br/><br/>“They actually want my head.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head.<br/><br/>They realized that their heads were a little special, so they wanted to transfer their heads.<br/><br/>From their memories, Wang Xian also understood another point. In the wilderness of the heaven-splitting primordial lands, it was exceptionally dangerous.<br/><br/>Even the strong disciples of the Lich Kingdom would kill each other and plunder each other.<br/><br/>As long as they became stronger, they would be able to obtain more resources and a better place to cultivate.<br/><br/>In the Scorpion Imperial City, there was indeed a blessed land. One could cultivate a powerful poison body there.<br/><br/>However, one would have to pay a huge amount of resources to enter and cultivate there.<br/><br/>Wang Xian had some understanding of the information in the Scorpion Imperial City in his mind. He moved his body and continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>Not long after, a huge city within the poisonous fog appeared in his sight.<br/><br/>The entire city was huge. It used the mountain peaks as the city walls and looked mysterious from afar.<br/><br/>The poisonous fog in the surroundings was seeping out from here.<br/><br/>Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and continued flying in.<br/><br/>Scorpion Imperial City was an open city. Even outsiders could enter it.<br/><br/>Of course, if a large number of strangers entered, they would also be monitored.<br/><br/>Wang Xian entered alone and did not attract much attention.<br/><br/>When he entered the Scorpion King City, Wang Xian saw a large number of citizens of the Lich Kingdom.<br/><br/>All of them were powerful liches.<br/><br/>The entire Scorpion King City was like a zoo for different species.<br/><br/>All kinds of liches were put together and emitted all kinds of strange and evil auras.<br/><br/>Most of them were mainly dark and poisonous.<br/><br/>As Wang Xian flew above the city, he could smell the strong smell of blood.<br/><br/>“No wonder witches are called evil, mysterious, strange, and powerful. Some of the witches in the Scorpion Imperial City are indeed strange and Evil!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled to himself. This was because the way he trained was destined to be cruel and evil.<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>After flying for half an hour, he began to speed up.<br/><br/>The buildings in the entire scorpion imperial city were oddly shaped. Some of them were living in a nest.<br/><br/>Some of them were living in a strange wormhole.<br/><br/>There were very few buildings like humans.<br/><br/>“Let’s go to the center of the Scorpion Imperial City and take a look at the blessed land. Then, we will destroy this place!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a sinister look.<br/><br/>This time around, he was here to destroy the Lich Kingdom. He would kill as many as he could.<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not show any mercy to these strange-looking creatures.<br/><br/>What they were after was the survival of the fittest. In that case, they would perish under the law of the Jungle!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Near the center of the Scorpion Imperial City, a gigantic ball stood there.<br/><br/>The diameter of the ball was more than 100 million kilometers. On the ball, there were numerous holes of varying sizes.<br/><br/>There were experts entering and exiting these holes from time to time.<br/><br/>“Is this the poison nest of the Scorpion Imperial City? It’s a paradise that is connected to the heaven-opening and primal continent. All the poison barriers are overflowing from here.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled. With a movement, the Yin-yang dragon disk appeared around him.<br/><br/>The Yin and yang swirled and his figure slowly disappeared.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s figure moved and flew straight into the cave.<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>Just as he arrived in front of a cave entrance, a corrosive force suddenly attacked him.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was slightly shocked when he saw this.<br/><br/>He was able to be discovered even though he was hiding in the yin-yang Dragon Plate!<br/><br/>This…\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
