The World Was Shocked</h1><div class=\"entry-content\" id=\"htmlContent\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3539 3538 hundred cities were destroyed. The world was shocked<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>Screams continued to ring out. The death of the leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance was a huge blow to all the powerful disciples of the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>Some of the troops of the Hundred Cities Alliance had given up resisting and were quietly waiting for death!<br/><br/>Not long ago, they had been clamoring to destroy the dragon palace. Now, they were being welcomed by death!<br/><br/>The world was unpredictable!<br/><br/>At this moment, they realized that becoming enemies with the Dragon Palace was their worst choice.<br/><br/>It was their choice to walk towards death!<br/><br/>With their resistance reduced, the Dragon Palace’s attacks did not stop. One by one, Universe Knight Level Great Beings from 100 cities were swiftly killed.<br/><br/>Over 80 cities, how terrifying was the number of their elite Great Beings?<br/><br/>It was no exaggeration to say that over 80 cities, the quality of universe knight level Great Beings was about five times that of Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>It was quality, not quantity!<br/><br/>Dragon Palace was able to have its current quality only after destroying several cities of the Hundred City Alliance and the Demon Witch Clan!<br/><br/>And the other party was still more than five times that of Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>Other than that, there were more than 300 universe masters with close to 400 combat powers, which was three times more powerful than the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>But now, they were being killed rapidly.<br/><br/>The Hundred Cities Alliance was being destroyed rapidly!<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze over. His body moved and he flew towards the heavy killing profound yellow talisman.<br/><br/>This was an innate true treasure that was filled with power and strangeness!<br/><br/>This was an innate supreme treasure with earth attribute!<br/><br/>He flew over and immediately grabbed the heavy kill Xuanhuang Talisman in his hand!<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>Suddenly, when Wang Xian’s palm grabbed onto it, a terrifying power of light flew out from the heavy kill Xuanhuang Talisman!<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed this terrifying power of light and his expression changed slightly!<br/><br/>“Tai Chi Dragon Plate!”<br/><br/>He growled and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate headed straight for the heavy kill Xuan Huang Talisman.<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>However, at this moment, a pair of bright wings suddenly appeared around the heavy kill Xuan Huang Talisman. The pair of bright wings carried the heavy kill Xuan Huang Talisman and instantly flew towards the west!<br/><br/>A hole was easily created on the Tai Chi Dragon Plate!<br/><br/>“This is?”<br/><br/>Seeing this scene, Wang Xian’s face darkened slightly. On this innate supreme treasure, there was a technique set up by an expert of the Universe Dominator realm.<br/><br/>This was also to prevent the loss of the innate supreme treasure!<br/><br/>An innate supreme treasure was also a treasure to a race at the peak of the universe!<br/><br/>Many experts at the universe dominator realm did not even have an innate supreme treasure that was suitable for them!<br/><br/>Wang Xian watched the innate supreme treasure fly away and knew that he could not stop it!<br/><br/>He shook his head speechlessly.<br/><br/>The techniques of the peak races in the universe were still not something he could withstand.<br/><br/>However, he had gained enough this time!<br/><br/>He swept his gaze across the surroundings. This battle was about to end!<br/><br/>After putting away the corpse of Bai Cheng Alliance master, Wang Xian’s body moved and flew towards the center of the mountain peak.<br/><br/>He could sense that Bai Cheng Alliance Master’s universe God Country was within this mountain peak!<br/><br/>After entering the mountain peak, he walked straight into the god country of the Alliance Master of Hundred Cities.<br/><br/>The God country of the Alliance Master of Hundred Cities was not very big, but there were many treasures in it.<br/><br/>“This time, the Dragon Palace can obtain a huge upgrade. Furthermore, those 108 innate numinous treasures are enough to allow the five elements grinding to achieve a breakthrough!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was searching the god country of the Alliance Master of hundred cities with an excited expression.<br/><br/>The battle with the Hundred Cities Alliance had lasted for more than ten years!<br/><br/>Today, they were finally completely annihilated!<br/><br/>After annihilating them, the strength of the Dragon Palace was sufficient to reach the top ranks below the peak of the universe!<br/><br/>“I wonder if it can be compared to the ancestral dragon lineage, the Holy Dragon Lineage!”<br/><br/>He mumbled!<br/><br/>This time, putting everything aside, the Dragon Palace could increase the number of masters with level three combat strength by four to five!<br/><br/>Four to five masters, and with the current number, it could reach more than a dozen!<br/><br/>As for Wang Xian’s own strength, he didn’t know if he could fight against a real universe master!<br/><br/>Even if he wasn’t his opponent, he shouldn’t be killed so easily!<br/><br/>Of course, the prerequisite was that his opponent didn’t have an innate supreme treasure!<br/><br/>An innate supreme treasure was still a little too strange!<br/><br/>“What exactly did we see? What exactly did we see?”<br/><br/>At the same time, in the distance to the east of the Hundred City Peak, there were more than ten powerful warriors floating in the air.<br/><br/>In front of them was a telescope, a powerful telescope from the technological world!<br/><br/>The Technological World was the pinnacle of technology in the universe, and they were the strongest of the technological forces.<br/><br/>They were also the only technological force within the Heaven Opening Primal Continent!<br/><br/>It could be said that, on one hand, the technological world was monopolized!<br/><br/>And this telescope could look far into the distance!<br/><br/>They were on this side, and they could clearly see the battle at the Hundred Cities Peak through the telescope.<br/><br/>They saw the experts of the Dragon Palace kill their way to the hundred cities peak, and they saw the Hundred Cities Alliance being slaughtered easily!<br/><br/>Yes, it was a complete slaughter!<br/><br/>Because they were too far away, they couldn’t sense the power of the battle, so they naturally didn’t know the strength of the other party.<br/><br/>But through their binoculars, they could see that this battle was completely one-sided.<br/><br/>It was even easily crushed.<br/><br/>The Hundred Cities Alliance didn’t even have the power to resist!<br/><br/>The incomparably powerful Hundred Cities Alliance master was even killed in a strange way!<br/><br/>The war was very, very short from the beginning to the end, so short that it was unbelievable!<br/><br/>What kind of force was the Hundred Cities Alliance?<br/><br/>Even though many cities were destroyed by the Dragon Palace, there were still more than eighty cities alliance!<br/><br/>The power of their alliance was equivalent to the Alliance of more than eighty high-level races!<br/><br/>Their force was absolutely terrifying!<br/><br/>However, now that they were slaughtered so easily, this war seemed to be an unequal slaughter!<br/><br/>From the beginning to the end, less than ten minutes had passed.<br/><br/>Ten minutes of destruction was simply unbelievable!<br/><br/>“Is this the strength of the Dragon Palace? The Hundred Cities Alliance was actually so easily destroyed!”<br/><br/>“This is the Hundred Cities Alliance, the force that stood within our heaven opening primal continent for close to ten billion years was destroyed just like that?”<br/><br/>“Just how strong are the Dragon Palace? Just how many experts do they have?”<br/><br/>More than ten experts roared in disbelief!<br/><br/>One of them immediately sent the news they had seen to the universe AI.<br/><br/>No one believed it at first!<br/><br/>Isn’t this news a joke?<br/><br/>The Hundred Cities Alliance had announced not long ago that they were going to destroy the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>How could the Hundred Cities Alliance be destroyed by the Dragon Palace Now?<br/><br/>Did the dragon palace have the strength to do so?<br/><br/>It was obvious that the Dragon Palace didn’t have the strength to do so!<br/><br/>And just when many people didn’t believe it, information suddenly burst out one by one!<br/><br/>All this information was released by a group of weaklings who had escaped from the hundred cities peak through the teleportation array.<br/><br/>The Hundred Cities Alliance’s destruction and the destruction of their city’s powerhouses made them completely homeless.<br/><br/>They were wantonly venting on the universe’s AI and spreading the news.<br/><br/>When the other powerhouses’disciples on the universe’s AI saw this large amount of news, they also widened their eyes.<br/><br/>It was filled with disbelief!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
