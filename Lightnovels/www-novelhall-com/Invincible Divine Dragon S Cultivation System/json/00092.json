It’s definitely a top-tier battle pet in our Milky Way. It’s much more powerful than some ordinary yalong mounts.”<br/><br/>“Just what kind of background does this immortal palace battle pet have? It hasn’t even been a year since it appeared in our Milky Way, yet it already sold such a level battle pet. which powerful race is behind them? which powerful force?”<br/><br/>On the universe’s AI, a few months ago, the immortal palace battle pet had already entered the sight of many people.<br/><br/>When they saw the news of the new battle pet being sold, it caused an uproar.<br/><br/>It was a peak God Emperor Battle Pet!<br/><br/>This time, the three-foot race had better luck and obtained the right to purchase this peak God Emperor Battle Pet.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, Yan Yan, not bad, not bad. This time, your hands are fast. This battle pet belongs to us.”<br/><br/>At this time, in front of the Wangyin continent, more than ten short figures were floating in the sky above the Milky Way.<br/><br/>An old man in the center smiled and patted the head of a woman, laughing loudly.<br/><br/>“It’s my luck that’s better.”<br/><br/>The woman smiled, her face full of joy.<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, some people saw the ten people of the three-foot race, and their eyes revealed a look of reverence.<br/><br/>This was especially the case for the short, white-haired elder in the middle.<br/><br/>He was one of the powerhouses at the peak of the Milky Way.<br/><br/>“He’s Here!”<br/><br/>At this moment, an expert from the three-foot race saw the ship and smiled.<br/><br/>“Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>The old man in the lead moved and flew over immediately.<br/><br/>“Is the universe knight here?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood on the ship of the Immortal Palace’s War Pet and looked at the group of people from the three-foot race flying over with a smile on his face.<br/><br/>Half an hour later, the transaction was completed.<br/><br/>A large number of divine stones appeared in Wang Xian’s hands.<br/><br/>He immediately entered the silver gazing continent and exchanged these divine stones for a large number of resources.<br/><br/>“Phew!”<br/><br/>After spending two days to purchase the divine stones, Wang Xian returned to the Dragon Palace in the Milky Way volcano region. A smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>“Dragon Palace, we have exchanged some of the resources of the ice mountain races for medicinal pills, divine herbs, and divine fruits.”<br/><br/>In the Dragon Palace, the eight-limbed demonic fiend and Wang Xian walked over excitedly.<br/><br/>With the destruction of the ice mountain race, all the resources had been brought over.<br/><br/>Wang Xian received the resources from the group. His eyes were filled with excitement.<br/><br/>The resources for a breakthrough were sufficient!<br/><br/>“Let’s return to the main Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>He said to the eight-limbed demonic fiend and disappeared immediately.<br/><br/>“It’s time to upgrade.”<br/><br/>When he returned to the Dragon King’s Hall in the main Dragon Palace, Wang Xian took out all the resources and immediately swallowed them.<br/><br/>A large number of elixirs were converted into dragon qi, which was rapidly accumulating to welcome the transformation.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Clan leader, we didn’t find any information on that Wang Xian. He should be from a relatively remote region.”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian was upgrading his strength, more than ten elders gathered in a study room at the location of the dragon race.<br/><br/>An elder reported in a deep voice.<br/><br/>“An outsider? Send out a wanted notice. Anyone who finds traces of that Wang Xian will report to us, the Dragon tribe. After the confirmation, we will be rewarded with a divine artifact at the peak of the celestial thearch level.”<br/><br/>The leader of the Dragon Tribe, who was holding a strange beast bone in the middle, said faintly.<br/><br/>“Leader, we went to look for the supremacy of the foggy tribe and asked him to help us lock onto him. He rejected us.”<br/><br/>An elder beside him said.<br/><br/>“It’s normal for him to reject us. It’s not as simple as we imagined to be able to exterminate the ice mountain race. The foggy race doesn’t want to get involved. However, a strong dragon can not suppress a local snake. Furthermore, we are Dragons!”<br/><br/>“As long as he is still active in the Milky Way, we will be able to exterminate him.”<br/><br/>The clan leader of the Dragon Race held the beast bone in his hand and said calmly. He was filled with confidence.<br/><br/>“I heard that Wang Xian has the strength of a peak divine emperor. His speed is very strange. Leave it to me when the time comes.”<br/><br/>An old man with a divine dragon tattoo on his face spoke on the right.<br/><br/>His face was completely covered by the Divine Dragon Tattoo, making him look a little ferocious.<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>The leader of the Dragon tribe nodded. “There is no one in the Milky Way who dares to go against us, the Dragon Tribe.”<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Did you guys see the information on the universal ai? The Dragon Race actually issued a wanted order. If anyone meets that Wang Xian, they will be given a divine weapon at the peak of the Celestial Emperor Realm. This is simply too generous.”<br/><br/>“It seems that Wang Xian has completely angered the dragon race. A divine weapon at the peak of the Celestial Emperor Realm. When the time comes, the person who will kill Wang Xian will probably be at the level of a universe Knight.”<br/><br/>“That’s for sure. Unless he hides in our willow deity Daoist sect and the venerable willow deity can protect him, as long as he is active in the Milky Way, he will definitely be destroyed.”<br/><br/>“Junior brother Wang Xian is not simple either. He is very mysterious and his strength is also very terrifying. It’s not like you have not seen the speed at which he moved in the Gemini Celestial Emperor’s divine kingdom that day. It’s too fast. The dragon race might not be able to destroy him.”<br/><br/>“It’s hard to say. The dragon-descendant race is an elementary race that has stood tall in our universe for billions of years. Their foundation is extremely deep. It shouldn’t be a big problem for them to destroy an expert at the peak of the Divine Emperor Realm.”<br/><br/>When the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect saw this news, they were not too shocked.<br/><br/>After all, Wang Xian had killed an expert at the peak of the divine emperor realm from the dragon-descendant race.<br/><br/>However, they were still surprised by the generosity of the dragon race.<br/><br/>Who would not be tempted to report their location and obtain a divine weapon at the peak of the Celestial Thearch?<br/><br/>The disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect were discussing whether Wang Xian could be eliminated and how long he could last?<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>In the main Dragon Palace in the distant ruins of the Mohan clan, a voice filled with the might of a dragon shook the world.<br/><br/>In the Dragon King Palace, a divine dragon with a body size of 50,000 meters and emitting a domineering light was entrenched there.<br/><br/>From Afar, it looked like a sacred and Majestic Mountain Peak.<br/><br/>Every single dragon scale was like a jade that had seized the fortunes of the world, emitting light.<br/><br/>Wang Xian slowly raised his head. It was sacred and imposing.<br/><br/>“Ding! Congratulations to host for raising your level to the fifth level of celestial thearch.”<br/><br/>“Ding, Congratulations to host for comprehending the Laws of the Divine Dragon, the shadow of the Holy Dragon.”<br/><br/>Name: Wang Xian<br/><br/>Race: Yin-yang Five Elements Divine Dragon (man-dragon unity)<br/><br/>Level: Level 5 divine emperor of the Void (eighth form of the Divine Dragon Transformation)<br/><br/>Origin: 1% (99% needed for the next breakthrough)<br/><br/>Supernatural ability: ruling the water tribe (ruling the water tribe below one’s level)<br/><br/>Devouring creatures (devouring creatures to extract the origin)<br/><br/>Control of the five elements<br/><br/>Technique: Dragon God transformation<br/><br/>Technique: Soul Capture, spirit attach<br/><br/>Technique: Dragon Eye Lock, Five Elements Dragon Claw, Yin-yang realm break, eight luminaries dragon scale, Sacred Dragon Shadow<br/><br/>Aspect: five elements great mill, Dragon Country in the palm, Dragon Head under the sky, Dragon Body of 10,000 miles, yin-yang Poles, Yin-yang five elements alms bowl, dragon tail swing!<br/><br/>Control Law: metal, wood, water, fire, Earth, light, dark wind<br/><br/>God Country: Dragon Palace<br/><br/>Dragon Palace: Level 9.<br/><br/>Dragon Palace members: 1034450<br/><br/>“I’ve broken through to the universe knight level.
