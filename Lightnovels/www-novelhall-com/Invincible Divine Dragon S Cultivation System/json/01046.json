How could there be such a coincidence? Then, how should our lord from flowing water forbidden ground resolve this matter?”<br/><br/>“Who would have thought that the Lord Tianyuan creation of the flowing water forbidden ground actually has a good relationship with this Wang Xian! ”<br/><br/>The conversation between the Tianyuan creation of the flowing water forbidden ground and Wang Xian caused all the strong disciples around to show an extremely shocked expression!<br/><br/>This? ?<br/><br/>This? ? ? ?<br/><br/>There was actually a trace of a connection!<br/><br/>Then, would their Lord Tianyuan creation of the flowing water forbidden ground resolve this matter like this?<br/><br/>How would this situation be resolved?<br/><br/>Everyone was extremely shocked!<br/><br/>No one had expected that the matter would develop to such an extent!<br/><br/>“Weng Weng! ”<br/><br/>Right at this moment, the surrounding space trembled slightly, and a figure that was emitting golden light slowly appeared at the side!<br/><br/>The golden light dissipated, and a tall and sturdy figure stood there!<br/><br/>This was an old man, an old man holding a huge axe in his hand!<br/><br/>The old man’s entire body was exuding an endless might!<br/><br/>The terrifying sharpness wasn’t concealed at all!<br/><br/>The moment the old man appeared, everyone around him, all the experts holding metal attribute sharp swords, couldn’t control the sharp swords in their hands as they fell to the ground.<br/><br/>It was as if they had suffered a huge pressure!<br/><br/>Some metal attribute experts felt extremely small!<br/><br/>This old man seemed to be controlling their lives, controlling their lives!<br/><br/>“Greetings, Lord Tianyuan Creation! ”<br/><br/>“Greetings, Lord Tianyuan Creation! ”<br/><br/>When the group of strong disciples from the undeserved forbidden ground saw the appearance of the old man, they quickly knelt down and greeted him loudly!<br/><br/>The rest of the strong disciples from the sacred land, Forbidden Ground, and sacred academy also knelt down and greeted him loudly!<br/><br/>In the sword and magic universe, two strong practitioners of Tianyuan creation had arrived!<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the old man and his eyes flickered slightly!<br/><br/>“Liu Lan, what’s Going On?”<br/><br/>The old man looked at the Heaven’s origin creation realm in the flowing water forbidden land and asked!<br/><br/>(‘I haven’t asked yet. This powerhouse from the nine-origin universe is the heir of the Divine Dragon Clan. ”<br/><br/>Liu Lan shook her head and introduced him to the old man. Then, she looked at Wang Xian and asked, “May I know your name, Dragon King? Why did you destroy the Space Forbidden Land?”<br/><br/>“My Name Is Wang Xian! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian replied indifferently. He looked at the two heaven origin creation realm powerhouses from the sword and magic universe and continued, “As for why you want to destroy the forbidden space, you can ask your disciples! ” “Nine origin universe, the Divine Dragon Clan! ”<br/><br/>The old man who was in the Heaven origin creation realm of the undeserved forbidden ground muttered to himself. His eyes sparkled as he looked at the group of powerhouses from the undeserved forbidden ground!<br/><br/>“Patriarch! ”<br/><br/>An expert who was at the peak of the ruler realm called out respectfully. Then, he began to report through voice transmission!<br/><br/>Over at the flowing water forbidden ground, the first elder of the flowing water forbidden ground also hurriedly reported!<br/><br/>He didn’t dare to hide anything!<br/><br/>He also didn’t dare to tell any lies!<br/><br/>“This Wang Xian, Dragon King, the space forbidden ground is an expert from our sword and Magic Universe. It’s a powerful force in our universe. The calamity is about to arrive. There are other solutions! ”<br/><br/>After the undeserved forbidden ground’s Tianyuan creation heard this, he frowned slightly and looked at Wang Xian!<br/><br/>He could feel the power of Wang Xian’s attack just now.<br/><br/>He could already reel lt.<br/><br/>He could also feel the nine types of elemental energy contained in Wang Xian’s body.<br/><br/>Although he had not reached the Tianyuan creation stage, his terrifying combat strength was no weaker than theirs!<br/><br/>He did not dare to be domineering when facing such an expert.<br/><br/>He could not be domineering either!<br/><br/>(‘I am not an expert from your sword and Magic Universe. ” Wang Xian replied faintly when he heard his words. “How are you going to solve this, Dragon King?”<br/><br/>Liu Lan looked at Wang Xian and asked as well!<br/><br/>“The space forbidden land is seeking its own destruction. Besides the space forbidden land, there is also the flowing water forbidden land. As an expert at the Heaven’s origin blessed realm and the strongest expert in the flowing water forbidden land, I hope you can give me a complete solution! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at Liu Lan and didn’t give in at all!<br/><br/>He had said that he needed a complete solution to both his matter and long Yinhao’s matter!<br/><br/>If they didn’t give him a solution, they would have to pay a price!<br/><br/>“What is it?”<br/><br/>The water energy around Liu Lan dissipated and revealed his face.<br/><br/>The face of a woman!<br/><br/>At this moment, she was also frowning slightly as she looked at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>If it wasn’t a last resort, they didn’t want to become enemies with Wang Xian!<br/><br/>This was because once they really started fighting, they would be at the center of their sword and Magic Universe.<br/><br/>They couldn’t bear the consequences!<br/><br/>Especially before the arrival of the calamity.<br/><br/>If a terrifying battle really broke out, it could almost be announced that with the arrival of the calamity, their sword and magic universe would completely disappear!<br/><br/>They would be conquered!<br/><br/>Therefore, regardless of whether it was the heaven origin creation of the flowing water forbidden land or the heaven origin creation of the undeserved forbidden land, they all suppressed a trace of dissatisfaction in their hearts!<br/><br/>“You guys once issued an order that the disciples in the universe were not allowed to kill each other hundreds of millions of years ago, but I have a little brother here. Yes, the disciples of your sword and Magic Universe were attacked and killed by the disciples of your flowing water forbidden land! ”<br/><br/>“Also, today, the master of the flowing water forbidden ground protected his grandson directly. As if this didn’t happen, I need an explanation for this. ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian replied to Liu Lan!<br/><br/>When Liu Lan heard Wang Xian’s words, he frowned even more. A hint of coldness flashed across his eyes!<br/><br/>He looked down at the group of strong disciples from the Flowing Water Forbidden Ground!<br/><br/>“Sir, about this matter…”<br/><br/>The first elder and second elder of the flowing water forbidden ground heard Wang Xian’s words.<br/><br/>When they saw the anger on Liu Lan’s face, they hurriedly knelt on the ground again, wanting to explain!<br/><br/>“There’s no need to explain. Just tell me everything! ”<br/><br/>Liu Lan said to them calmly!<br/><br/>“Yes, Sir!”<br/><br/>When the first elder of the flowing water forbidden ground and the others heard the words of their heavenly yuan destiny realm powerhouse, they did not dare to hide anything at all. They told them everything one by one!<br/><br/>“HMPH, he did not even stop our orders. I think Xiao He has really become the master of the forbidden ground. He has forgotten who he is! ”<br/><br/>When Liu Lan heard the outcome of the matter, he snorted coldly with a cold expression!<br/><br/>His words caused everyone around to tremble.<br/><br/>In their universe, the only ones who dared to talk about the master of the forbidden land like this were probably the two in front of them!<br/><br/>“Cripple his position as the master of the Forbidden Land and lock him in the flowing water cage until the calamity arrives! ”<br/><br/>Liu Lan continued speaking coldly!<br/><br/>As soon as she finished speaking, no one around dared to speak. All of them lowered their heads.<br/><br/>Everyone could feel the atmosphere around them, and it was extremely depressing.<br/><br/>It was as if the Sky had fallen!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
