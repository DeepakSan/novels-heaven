The moment Wang Xian made his move, there were only a few people who could see Wang Xian’s figure.<br/><br/>Among the surrounding onlookers, there were only a few top-notch experts.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s strange speed and the gray energy surrounding his body caused him to arrive in front of Fa du in an instant.<br/><br/>This time, he used the power of the five elements.<br/><br/>The power of the five elements and the Thunder attribute. Even though the other three attributes were still suppressed, Wang Xian’s strength could still kill a level 8 universe knight in an instant.<br/><br/>Especially when it came to speed, FDU didn’t even have time to react.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s foot landed on FDU’s face and stomped down heavily.<br/><br/>A Lightning Shield was formed at the spot below, causing his head to smash onto the Lightning Shield.<br/><br/>The tremendous force caused his head to start to distort. His face was no longer human-like as he spat out a large amount of blood.<br/><br/>He was killed in one move!<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>At this moment, everyone around was stunned. They looked at this sudden scene in astonishment.<br/><br/>In just an instant, many people didn’t see what was happening clearly. The result was this scene in front of them.<br/><br/>The eldest senior brother of Great Thunder Sound College was killed in one move and stepped into the void space, unable to resist at all.<br/><br/>This…<br/><br/>This was simply terrifying and unbelievable!<br/><br/>“How is this possible!”<br/><br/>All the disciples of Great Thunder Sound College were shocked when they saw this scene, and their faces were full of disbelief.<br/><br/>How was this possible?<br/><br/>Their eldest senior brother, who had the Combat Power of a universe knight at level eight, was actually defeated in one move?<br/><br/>This… What kind of strength was his opponent?<br/><br/>A female disciple of the great thunderclap school shouted loudly with a face full of shock.<br/><br/>“Hehe, didn’t you want me to kneel down and beg for mercy?”<br/><br/>“Didn’t you say that you wanted to see if I could withstand two moves? What? The eldest senior brother of the Great Thunderclap School is actually such a trash? It seems that your faction is also trash!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stepped on Fa Du’s face with his foot. His face was filled with mockery.<br/><br/>Provoking him?<br/><br/>This FA du was really tired of living. Not to mention him, even the strongest person of the Great Thunderclap Academy dared to be impudent in front of Wang Xian. If he really angered Wang Xian, he would be able to kill him.<br/><br/>“Ah!”<br/><br/>A painful scream came out of Fa Du’s mouth. Cold Sweat and blood mixed together, and his face was filled with fear.<br/><br/>He was actually killed instantly!<br/><br/>He didn’t have the slightest ability to resist!<br/><br/>This… What exactly was the strength of this eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray Race?<br/><br/>“Eldest senior brother… eldest senior brother is so strong!”<br/><br/>At the back, all the disciples of the Thunder Ray race trembled as they stared with their eyes wide open.<br/><br/>They opened their mouths slightly and were also extremely shocked.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s strength was too… terrifying!<br/><br/>They knew clearly that their eldest senior brother had the combat strength of a level seven universe knight more than a year ago. Now, he actually had the ability to instantly kill a Dharmaraja!<br/><br/>“Could it be that eldest senior brother had hidden his strength in the past?”<br/><br/>They thought to themselves.<br/><br/>“Hiss, so strong!”<br/><br/>When the surrounding disciples of the various forces saw this scene, they sucked in a breath of cold air and were filled with shock.<br/><br/>Just now, how strong was this senior brother of the Thunder Ray Race?<br/><br/>He was definitely above level eight of a universe knight!<br/><br/>Level nine of a universe knight? If this was placed in the Open Heaven Primal Continent, he would be considered a strong individual.<br/><br/>If placed in the Thunder Ray race and the Great Thunderclap Academy, he would be considered an elder!<br/><br/>How could he be considered a disciple with such strength?<br/><br/>Gulp<br/><br/>They gulped and looked at Wang Xian with a hint of respect.<br/><br/>“Let go of our eldest senior brother. Let Go of him quickly. Do you lightning race want to start a war with our great Thunderclap Academy?”<br/><br/>The disciples of the Great Thunderclap Academy heard their eldest senior brother’s miserable cry and saw his miserable look. They shouted loudly.<br/><br/>“Hehe, don’t worry. I can kill this kind of trash easily!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the group of disciples of the Great Thunderclap Academy who had ugly expressions and smiled disdainfully.<br/><br/>He stretched out his leg and kicked them hard on their bodies, sending them to the front.<br/><br/>“Eldest senior brother!”<br/><br/>The group of disciples of the Great Thunderclap School hurriedly helped FA du up. Their expressions were extremely embarrassed.<br/><br/>Compared to the expressions of the disciples of the Lightning race, they were even more embarrassed.<br/><br/>There was a hint of fear in their eyes when they looked at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“The auction is about to start. Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings and smiled faintly. Then, he said to the disciples of the Lightning race behind him.<br/><br/>“It’s eldest senior brother!”<br/><br/>“Eldest senior brother, you are simply too amazing!”<br/><br/>“Haha, Eldest Senior Brother is so strong. He easily defeated a bunch of trash from the Great Thunderclap Academy!”<br/><br/>The disciples of the Lightning race reacted and shouted excitedly.<br/><br/>Exhale, Exhale, exhale!<br/><br/>The grievance just now, because of Wang Xian’s attack completely disappeared.<br/><br/>Big Brother to Big Brother!<br/><br/>Their senior brother Wang Xian crushed the other easily.<br/><br/>Who’s the trash?<br/><br/>Who’s a loser?<br/><br/>How dare you shout in front of them?<br/><br/>One by one the disciples laughed and looked mockingly at all the disciples of the Great Thunderclap Academy.<br/><br/>A reversal of the Poles, that’s all!<br/><br/>“Get lost!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest flew forward and spoke directly to the disciples of the Great Thunderclap School who were blocking their way.<br/><br/>When all the disciples of the Great Thunderclap School heard that, their expressions changed drastically. They immediately opened up a path in frustration.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Hahaha, good, good, good. This generation of the great thunderclap school is really useless. They can’t even withstand a single move from us disciples of the Thunder Ray Race!”<br/><br/>At this moment, hundreds of figures were floating in the sky above the Floating Thunder Island.<br/><br/>The first elder and the second supreme elder of the Thunder Ray race were laughing loudly.<br/><br/>They had seen clearly what had happened to the disciples just now.<br/><br/>“Humph, Lei Shanqing, don’t be too arrogant. Those people might not be disciples of Your Thunder Ray Race!”<br/><br/>In front of them, a few bald old men and old women were floating in the sky with gloomy faces as they said coldly.<br/><br/>“Haha, you don’t Have to worry about whether they are the disciples of our Thunder Ray tribe. However, it’s enough that they will stand on our side and torture you!”<br/><br/>The second supreme elder of the Thunder Ray tribe laughed heartily.<br/><br/>When Lei Yuntian was defeated just now, their expressions were the same as those of the Great Thunderclap Academy.<br/><br/>However, it was fortunate that Wang Xian appeared in time.<br/><br/>Although they were equally shocked by Wang Xian’s strength, they didn’t have the time to question him at this moment. In any case, it felt great!<br/><br/>Wang Xian dared to make a move and offend the great thunderclap academy in such a manner. That was enough!<br/><br/>“HMPH!”<br/><br/>The group of experts from the Great Thunderclap Academy turned around and left with gloomy expressions. They flew towards the auction venue.<br/><br/>Their bodies were filled with cold killing intent.<br/><br/>“Soon, they won’t be able to laugh anymore!”<br/><br/>The deputy headmaster of the Great Thunderclap Academy, who was in the lead, sent a sinister voice transmission.<br/><br/>The eyes of the experts of the Great Thunderclap Academy flickered, and their killing intent was fierce.<br/><br/>“Hehe, Congratulations to the Thunder Ray tribe for recruiting such an outstanding disciple!”<br/><br/>At the back, the experts of the nine karma fire tribe and some experts from the cities congratulated the second supreme elder of the Thunder Ray tribe and the others.<br/><br/>“Haha, you’re too polite. Everyone, let’s go downstairs. It’s about to begin!”<br/><br/>The second Supreme Elder and the others responded with laughter, they were in a great mood!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
