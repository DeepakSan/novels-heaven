After receiving some information, his eyes sparkled as he ordered the old hag and the rest around him!<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The old witch and the other seven crazy demons immediately responded and unleashed their full strength!<br/><br/>Now that they had solved the problem of losing their rationality, they were even more powerful in battle!<br/><br/>Especially after the fire eagle crazy demon, Water Phoenix Totem, and Gardecker Angel Huo Min Tian were suppressed by Wang Xian!<br/><br/>Their strength had been greatly weakened!<br/><br/>Under such circumstances, Wu Sha and the rest had completely gained the upper hand!<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood there. The powerhouses from the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan didn’t dare to approach him even when they were faced with a group of crazed demons!<br/><br/>He scanned his surroundings and locked onto the powerhouses from the Angel clan as well as the top-notch powerhouses from the Phoenix clan!<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved his palm and the five elements Millstone flew towards an expert from the Angel clan!<br/><br/>This angel was surrounded by a large number of level three masters who were masters of the universe. He had a powerful treasure in his hand and was desperately trying to escape!<br/><br/>However, when he sensed that Wang Xian’s five elements millstone was attacking him, his body trembled and his face was filled with despair!<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>The Five Elements Millstone came to the sky above him and destroyed the battle angels around him effortlessly. Then, it easily suppressed them!<br/><br/>“Ahhhh!”<br/><br/>“Kill, Kill, Kill!”<br/><br/>When another Angel was suppressed by Wang Xian, the surrounding angels and experts of the Phoenix tribe who noticed it instantly went crazy!<br/><br/>They had to go all out, even if they had to suffer heavy injuries or even if they were on their last breaths. At this moment, they had to go all out!<br/><br/>Because if they didn’t go all out, they would die completely!<br/><br/>There was no chance at all!<br/><br/>“Hehe!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this, he smiled faintly. With a wave of his hand, the five elements grinding mill attacked the top-notch expert of the Phoenix clan!<br/><br/>An invincible force landed directly in the sky above him!<br/><br/>When the top-notch expert of the Phoenix clan saw this, he laughed miserably!<br/><br/>“Hahaha, the Dragon King is invincible!”<br/><br/>The demonic wings flattered and roared loudly. He spread his wings, and the wings rapidly expanded, covering the entire void!<br/><br/>He flapped his huge wings, and countless golden quicksand and terrifying hurricanes formed, attacking the Battle Angels in front of him!<br/><br/>“Rustle! Rustle! Rustle!”<br/><br/>The terrifying attacks directly pierced through the bodies of the battle angels, causing them to quickly collapse!<br/><br/>“Ah Ah!”<br/><br/>A miserable cry sounded out!<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, Ming Shisheng, Shi Sen, Lei Shan, and a few other crazy demons also took out their own trump cards!<br/><br/>The terrifying meteor directly descended, smashing towards the group of experts from the Phoenix clan!<br/><br/>The Ghostly Ming ghost clone ignored the attacks of material resources, shuttling through the battlefield like a shadow!<br/><br/>The lightning-like lightning bolts caused explosions to appear in the Void!<br/><br/>Every explosion caused the experts of the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan to die!<br/><br/>The terrifying array formation and the heavy water.<br/><br/>When the mad demons used their trump cards, it was a nightmare for the experts of the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan!<br/><br/>Every mad demon had killed their way out of the invincible region!<br/><br/>They used the blood of many powerhouses to build their reputation!<br/><br/>Now that the seven of them were working together, one could imagine how terrifying it was!<br/><br/>However, the one who made everyone feel even more terrified was the Dragon King!<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood there and casually killed any powerhouse. None of the powerhouses could withstand his attack!<br/><br/>“It’s over. This time, none of the powerhouses of the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan can escape!”<br/><br/>“There’s no way to escape. Look at the Dragon King. He just stood there and didn’t make any moves. With the Dragon King’s terrifying speed just now, none of them could escape!”<br/><br/>“I really didn’t expect such an outcome!”<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, all the Old Monsters of the invincible zone were already somewhat numb!<br/><br/>They looked at that figure, their eyes filled with deep reverence!<br/><br/>Since the birth of the Invincible Zone, an invincible existence had been born!<br/><br/>He was the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>The following battle was a little too easy. Wang Xian didn’t even need to make a move himself!<br/><br/>He stood there and watched quietly.<br/><br/>All the Battle Angels were killed. As for the other experts, they were all severely injured!<br/><br/>Wang Xian took them into custody.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, all of them are taken care of!”<br/><br/>The battle only lasted for about ten minutes. Seven Crazy Demons flew over and said with smiles on their faces!<br/><br/>“Alright.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head. With a wave of his arm, he brought them into the distance immediately!<br/><br/>After flying for five minutes, Wang Xian stopped. His eyes were sparkling!<br/><br/>“All of you, wait here for five minutes!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian instructed them. With a wave of his arm, he released all the suppressed experts and immediately cast the soul capturing spell!<br/><br/>Waves of information were transmitted into his mind!<br/><br/>At the same time, Wang Xian ordered them to summon all the divine kingdoms!<br/><br/>After obtaining all the divine kingdoms, Wang Xian waved his arm and killed them completely!<br/><br/>Standing in the air, Wang Xian checked all the information in his mind!<br/><br/>Soon, he opened his eyes and swept his gaze to the side. “Next, in the invincible zone, I will look for the experts from the angel race and Phoenix race and kill them!”<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Wu Sha and the rest were slightly shocked when they heard Wang Xian’s words. However, they nodded immediately. “It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>“Let’s go, Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, the energy of the incipient holy wings enveloped them. “Search for the news of the Angel Race and the Phoenix race on the AI brain of the universe or somewhere else. Then, we will rush over!”<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The seven mad demons immediately took action.<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with a hint of cold killing intent!<br/><br/>The angel race had already fought to the death with Wang Xian. They had tried to destroy him time and time again. In that case, he did not have to worry about his identity as a peak race of the Angel Race!<br/><br/>As for the Phoenix race, Wang Xian had obtained some clues from the memories of the Phoenix race!<br/><br/>This was related to the matters of the Divine Dragon Island!<br/><br/>The Divine Dragon Island was once the lair of the Divine Dragon Clan. It was the origin of the Divine Dragon Clan and also the foundation of the Divine Dragon Clan!<br/><br/>Currently, the Paradise on the Divine Dragon Island had been occupied by the space beasts in the mountains and seas!<br/><br/>However, he learned from the memories of a phoenix expert that the Green River Water Phoenix often went to the Divine Dragon Island!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
