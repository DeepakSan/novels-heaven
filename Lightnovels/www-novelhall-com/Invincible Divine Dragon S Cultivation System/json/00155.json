Among them, three were of the five elements.<br/><br/>Prime Minister GUI placed the resources in the Dragon King’s palace. The members of the Dragon Palace were looking at them with burning faces.<br/><br/>“Place all the corpses beside the dragon transformation pool. Lei Ming, go into the dragon transformation pool to recover from your injuries.”<br/><br/>“Prime Minister Gui, organize the distribution of the resources this time.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the large amount of resources in front of him. A smile appeared on his face as he immediately instructed.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui, Lei Ming, and the rest nodded their heads.<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and acquired Numinous Treasures flew over. The five elements grinding mill flew out and began to absorb them.<br/><br/>Although the resources this time around were huge, many of them were items like the divine weapon, the Dragon Cannon.<br/><br/>Such items could not be directly converted into strength.<br/><br/>Hence, the gains this time could not help Wang Xian to achieve a breakthrough in his strength.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the five elements millstone could be improved to make him stronger.<br/><br/>The rest of the members of the Dragon Palace could achieve a huge improvement.<br/><br/>This was especially so for the ordinary disciples of the Dragon Palace. The number of divine emperor powerhouses that they had killed this time was huge.<br/><br/>It was enough for all the members of the Dragon Palace to advance to the divine emperor realm.<br/><br/>Rumble<br/><br/>Roar! Roar! Roar<br/><br/>Not long after, a series of rumbling sounds came from the Dragon Palace. Wang Xian, who was in the Dragon King Palace helping the five elements grinding to devour the acquired spiritual treasure, was slightly stunned. He immediately flew towards the location of the dragon transformation pool.<br/><br/>A few leaders of the Dragon Palace, Prime Minister Gui, and the rest also rushed over immediately.<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>When they arrived in front of the dragon transformation pool, Wang Xian looked at a body inside and raised his eyebrows slightly.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, that Thunder seems to have undergone a huge change.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui flew over and said with a face full of astonishment.<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded. The Dragon Eyes of the yin-yang and five elements sized up the body of the Thunder.<br/><br/>“He has been imprisoned and raised for more than two billion years. After absorbing the bloodline in his body, the dragon blood in his body is almost depleted. Only the purest strand of dragon blood retains a trace of vitality in his body.”<br/><br/>“Now that he has absorbed the purest bloodline, he is going to evolve. Based on the pure lightning energy in his body, he should be evolving into a thunder dragon.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian opened his mouth and said while his eyes were shining.<br/><br/>“Thunder Dragon?”<br/><br/>Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, Prime Minister Gui and the rest were surprised.<br/><br/>Currently, the only pure Dragon God in the Dragon Palace was the wind dragon. If Lei Ming could become a dragon God, he would be the first Thunder Dragon and the second pure Elemental Dragon God in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Let Lei Ming absorb half of the resources this time. He used to have the combat strength of a level five universe knight. Now that his bloodline has improved, with his foundation and a large amount of resources, he should be able to recover a lot.<br/><br/>“At least he can reach the combat strength of a level three universe Knight.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said with a smile in his eyes.<br/><br/>If Lei Ming could reach the combat strength of a level three universe knight, then the Dragon Palace would have nothing to fear in the entire Milky Way.<br/><br/>Even among the low-level races in the universe, there was nothing to fear.<br/><br/>Among the low-level races in the universe, the strongest was only at the level 3 knight.<br/><br/>Reaching the level 4 knight, there would be a chance to lead the race to a higher level.<br/><br/>Of course, to step into the low-level races in the universe, other than having a level 4 Knight’s combat strength, the number of knights also had to reach 5,000.<br/><br/>This was an invisible rule.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace was still very, very far away from the level of the universe intermediate race.<br/><br/>The Thunder’s improvement was good news for the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>In the following period of time, the Dragon Palace quieted down and started to quickly increase its strength.<br/><br/>And on the Milky Way side, the discussions about the Dragon Palace didn’t stop.<br/><br/>The strength of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The strength of the Dragon Palace, countless people were discussing.<br/><br/>And during this time, the various universe primary races were analyzing the strength of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>According to the information they got.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace had at least 25 knights, of which 5 were level 2 knights.<br/><br/>This was the overall strength of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>After the battle ended, the Knights of the mist race came to the battlefield and did some calculations.<br/><br/>They left immediately after receiving some information.<br/><br/>The skeleton race also had experts in the front row who performed calculations and left.<br/><br/>The strong rise of the Dragon Palace still made many forces feel uneasy.<br/><br/>Not long after, the mist race directly announced on the universe AI that they welcomed the Dragon Palace to establish itself in the Milky Way.<br/><br/>When the other universe primary races saw the mist race openly welcoming them on the AI, they immediately followed suit.<br/><br/>Some of the weaker universe primary races were even more straightforward. They welcomed the members of the Dragon Palace as guests and guaranteed the safety of all the Asian Dragons in their territory.<br/><br/>The messages of friendliness also caused everyone in the Milky Way to discuss animatedly.<br/><br/>Everyone also knew that the Dragon Palace was truly established in the Milky Way and no power would dare to provoke them in the future.<br/><br/>The power with the most number of universe knights also fell on the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>While everyone was discussing the Dragon Palace, a piece of news that surprised all the powers came.<br/><br/>Two Knights from the ancient painting sect came and invited all the powers in the Milky Way.<br/><br/>This news didn’t spread very widely, only a bunch of low level universe races knew.<br/><br/>When they received the invitation from the ancient painting sect, the powers’faces were filled with curiosity.<br/><br/>They didn’t understand why the ancient art sect would suddenly invite them to a banquet.<br/><br/>However, since two universe knights had come in person, and they were at the second level of the venerable realm, all the powers still gave them face.<br/><br/>In the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian also received the invitation letter.<br/><br/>“This invitation letter from the ancient art sect… Dragon King, something is wrong. It should be for venerable Lou Shan and the others from the ancient art sect. They should be looking for the murderer.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui looked at the invitation letter and guessed.<br/><br/>“It should be. We have killed Venerable Lou Shan for more than a month. The ancient art sect should have received news of his death a long time ago.”<br/><br/>“At this time, how could they still have the mood to hold a banquet? They should be looking for who killed venerable Lou Shan.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.<br/><br/>When he killed Venerable Lou Shan, he thought of the ancient art sect’s revenge.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
