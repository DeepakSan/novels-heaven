We will remind all the major forces in the major cities that it is best not to open the teleportation array with the Hundred Cities Alliance. It will be bad if we accidentally injure them!”<br/><br/>Suddenly, a piece of news exploded within the heaven opening primal continent. The Hundred Cities Alliance, which was already in the limelight, exploded once again.<br/><br/>The highlight came from a statement from the Dragon Palace, which was the first statement that the Dragon Palace made when they entered the heaven opening primal continent.<br/><br/>When all the experts of the forces saw this statement, they were shocked.<br/><br/>“Is… is this the Dragon Palace’s statement? The people who were assassinated in the cities of the Hundred Cities Alliance recently, is the Dragon Palace announcing that they did it?”<br/><br/>“F * ck, this declaration of the Dragon Palace is so domineering. Not only did they announce that they were going to hunt all the disciples and powerhouses of the Hundred Cities Alliance, but they also warned the other cities that it was best to cut off contact with them.”<br/><br/>“Isn’t this declaration basically the same as the declaration of the Hundred Cities Alliance a few years ago? Is it the Dragon Palace’s turn to issue such a declaration now?”<br/><br/>“The assassination of the disciples of the Hundred Cities Alliance by the Peak dragon-type Dragon-type dragon-type Dragon-type assassin is a little terrifying just thinking about it!”<br/><br/>“With this, the Hundred Cities Alliance will be in even more trouble. How will the Hundred Cities Alliance defend against this?”<br/><br/>On the universe’s AI, countless people looked at the Dragon Palace’s declaration with shock on their faces.<br/><br/>30 years East River, 30 years West River.<br/><br/>Not long ago, the Hundred Cities Alliance wanted to hunt the disciples of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>However, after these few years, the Hundred Cities Alliance had become what it was today.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace began to hunt down the disciples of the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>Especially the legendary dragon-blooded assassin hunting down the Hundred Cities Alliance. This was a great pressure for the disciples and experts of the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>It was the same as the underworld race’s assassins hunting them.<br/><br/>Are you afraid that the experts of the peak races will assassinate you?<br/><br/>“Fortunately, I escaped from the Hundred Cities Alliance early!”<br/><br/>“I wonder what the Hundred Cities Alliance is going to do now. Is it going to get cold?”<br/><br/>“The strength of the Dragon Palace has already exceeded everyone’s imagination.”<br/><br/>Countless people were discussing on the universe’s AI.<br/><br/>On the other hand, everyone in the Hundred Cities Alliance looked extremely embarrassed.<br/><br/>They had just dealt with the danger of the city being destroyed, and now it was dangerous outside the city?<br/><br/>Could they still not get out?<br/><br/>There was some despair on their faces. Could it be that they would not go out in the future.<br/><br/>However, a large portion of the disciples and experts of the Hundred Cities Alliance had decided to go into seclusion and cultivate. They would only come out after thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years.<br/><br/>When all the city lords of the Hundred Cities Alliance saw this information, their bodies trembled violently.<br/><br/>No matter what, their losses this time were too great!<br/><br/>Next, they had to think of a way to deal with the prickling dragon species around their cities.<br/><br/>All the city lords were slightly tired.<br/><br/>They had never expected that a dragon palace would force them to this point.<br/><br/>After the alliance leader of the Hundred City Alliance received the news, his face fell silent.<br/><br/>He pondered for a long time and gave an order.<br/><br/>All the Universe Masters came and held a meeting of the Hundred Cities Alliance.<br/><br/>It was not an exaggeration to say that the Hundred Cities Alliance was in a life-and-death situation.<br/><br/>Time passed day by day, and the Hundred Cities Alliance did not give any response.<br/><br/>Some great beings only knew that a large number of great beings from the Hundred Cities Alliance had started to investigate the surroundings of the city.<br/><br/>However, they were unable to find any results.<br/><br/>After the Dragon Palace released the information, the thorned dragon had already retreated back to the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>How could they possibly wait for the other party’s revenge.<br/><br/>Only Ao Yao and a few universe master level thorned dragon were still active outside.<br/><br/>“I really didn’t expect that the Dragon Palace would actually force the Hundred City Alliance to such an extent!”<br/><br/>At this moment, it was located in a dense underground area.<br/><br/>Countless roots were interwoven in the underground area. In a cave where the roots were condensed, more than ten figures were sitting there.<br/><br/>They looked at the news in front of them and were filled with shock.<br/><br/>The one who spoke was Green Dragon Moon.<br/><br/>“Yeah, the Hundred City Alliance isn’t weak. They were forced to such an extent by the Dragon Palace. Besides, there should be many thorny dragon species in the dragon palace. These are peak dragon species!”<br/><br/>Beside Green Dragon Moon, an old man sighed.<br/><br/>“That Dragon King’s power should be at the universe ruler Level 2 Combat Power level, right?”<br/><br/>Another middle-aged man looked at Green Dragon Moon curiously.<br/><br/>“He should have broken through. When I first met him, he could easily kill a universe ruler Level 1 Combat Power Warrior, and now he should have broken through.”<br/><br/>Green Dragon Moon nodded.<br/><br/>“Green Dragon Moon, why don’t you invite that Dragon King to enter the entanglement land with us?”<br/><br/>An old man said.<br/><br/>“This…”<br/><br/>Green Dragon Moon was deep in thought. “If he goes, it means that the Dragon Palace is involved in the war between our ancestral dragon and the Holy Dragon.”<br/><br/>“Alas, we can’t do anything about it now. This is something left by senior Green Dragon Dutian. We Can’t Let the Holy Dragon get it. The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is on our side. You can explain everything clearly. If the Dragon King doesn’t go, we don’t have to force him.”<br/><br/>The old man sighed and said.<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>Azure Dragon Moon pondered for a moment and nodded slightly.<br/><br/>He took out the universal AI and sent some messages to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Did the powerhouses of the angel race… really interfere?”<br/><br/>After sending the messages, Azure Dragon Moon looked at the old man in the middle and asked.<br/><br/>“The Holy Dragon lineage has gained five innate treasures.”<br/><br/>The old man said in a deep voice. A few seconds later, he added, “If not for this, how could senior Azure Dragon Dutian be killed?”<br/><br/>Azure Dragon Moon was silent. His eyes were filled with sorrow.<br/><br/>The current ancestral dragon lineage was not having an easy time, especially the experts of the ancestral dragon lineage. They had encountered a terrifying crisis.<br/><br/>Although the angel race did not send their experts directly, taking out their innate supreme treasures was also a form of help.<br/><br/>A sense of powerlessness lingered in everyone’s heart.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>At the same time, in the underground of the Land of blood plasma, Wang Xian’s universe ai trembled. He immediately opened the message sent by the Green Dragon Moon.<br/><br/>“In the land of entanglement, the Dragon Palace of a senior with level three combat strength, a master of the ancestral dragon lineage. This senior was killed by an expert of the Holy Dragon lineage.”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this information, he was astonished.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace of a Master of the universe with level three combat strength contained all the treasures of that senior.<br/><br/>When Azure Dragon Moon asked him if he was interested, he also mentioned a question.<br/><br/>That was, it might be extremely dangerous to search for the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The danger came from the Holy Dragon lineage.<br/><br/>The Holy Dragon lineage was also extremely interested in the Dragon Palace which was a powerhouse of such a level.<br/><br/>Once Wang Xian joined the battle, it would be extremely dangerous for the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>That was because it meant that the dragon palace was completely involved in their war.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
