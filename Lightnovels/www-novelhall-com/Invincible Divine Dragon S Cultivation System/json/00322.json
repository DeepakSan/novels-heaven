A city appeared in his line of sight, and his eyes were sparkling.<br/><br/>At this moment, his body had undergone a transformation. There were a pair of horns on his head, and his face was covered by red dragon scales.<br/><br/>His entire body was also covered by dragon scales, making him look like a drakonid.<br/><br/>This form did not seem out of the ordinary in the five bug city. In fact, it was somewhat similar to the liches in the five bug city.<br/><br/>In the five bug city, many liches had all sorts of scales, tentacles, and the like.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the grotto-heaven blessed land in the five bug city was able to give birth to a special type of beetle. This type of beetle had an extremely tough carapace.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian entered the city, he did not immediately fly towards the grotto-heaven blessed land in the five bug city. He did not make a move immediately either.<br/><br/>When he attacked the scorpion imperial city, he was completely caught off guard.<br/><br/>The Lich Kingdom never expected that Wang Xian would destroy their city.<br/><br/>Under such circumstances, he easily succeeded.<br/><br/>However, after he was on guard, the other cities were definitely on guard.<br/><br/>For example, he would set up more secret formations. Once something happened to the city, a large number of experts could be teleported over directly.<br/><br/>Therefore, it was best for Wang Xian to be fully prepared for this attack.<br/><br/>“Hurry up, hurry up. Once you enter the city, it will be forbidden to leave the city. The five insects city will enter a state of Alert!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian arrived at the city gate, a voice came from the front.<br/><br/>“Eh? The city has been sealed?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly and continued walking inside.<br/><br/>With his current appearance, even if the Lich King was here, it would be difficult for him to recognize him without making a move.<br/><br/>“The scorpion imperial city was destroyed. It was the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace who did it.”<br/><br/>“Huh? Dragon King of the Dragon Palace? The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace who surrounded Lu Xingkong? Did he eat a bear’s heart or a leopard’s guts? How dare he provoke Our Lich Kingdom!”<br/><br/>“A force that surrounded Lu Xingkong actually dared to attack us. He’s courting death. Destroy their Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>As they walked in, the discussion of the liches could be heard from the surroundings.<br/><br/>There were many people here and all kinds of information could be obtained from this place.<br/><br/>Furthermore, he sent a message to Ba Qi and the rest to ask about the situation.<br/><br/>Under such circumstances, the poisonous horned dragon species could do more things.<br/><br/>For example, the poisonous horned dragon species could obtain the plans of the Lich Kingdom by lodging some of the experts in the five insect city.<br/><br/>This way, it would be much easier to start a fight.<br/><br/>Wang Xian sat in the Beast Colosseum of the Lich Kingdom and watched the two void God emperor level desolate beasts fighting in front of him.<br/><br/>Some of the surrounding liches were cheering.<br/><br/>However, at this moment, at the edge of the heaven opening primal continent, more than a thousand figures were standing on a lich that had countless legs and was flying rapidly like a centipede.<br/><br/>Heaven-devouring centipede!<br/><br/>This was the famous heaven-devouring centipede of the Lich Kingdom, and it was also a powerful lich.<br/><br/>This heaven-devouring centipede was the Mount of the Lich King.<br/><br/>Only when war broke out would the lich king ride on the heaven-devouring centipede to battle.<br/><br/>The heaven-devouring centipede was very fast, traveling a light-year distance in a flash.<br/><br/>They flew out of the heaven-opening desolation continent, toward the interior of the surrounding starry sky, and toward the nest of the ancient sea race.<br/><br/>While the main cities of the Lich Kingdom were defending, the Lich King had already led over a thousand experts and flew towards the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Since the Dragon Palace dared to attack them, they had to destroy the Dragon Palace as well.<br/><br/>As the Dragon Palace was the one who made the first move, they didn’t violate the rules.<br/><br/>Time flew by quickly. Wang Xian was temporarily staying in a lair in the five insect city.<br/><br/>An lie, Mo Sha, and three poisonous horned dragons stood respectfully in front of him.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, it will take another seven days for eight Qi to make a breakthrough. However, in five bug city, I and my three subordinates are more than enough!”<br/><br/>Mo Sha said to Wang Xian confidently.<br/><br/>Mo Sha had the combat strength of a universe knight at level seven. Beside him were three poisonous horned dragons with the combat strength of a universe knight at level six.<br/><br/>Ba Qi was used to increase Wang Xian’s strength after he started to destroy the scorpion imperial city.<br/><br/>However, he still needed seven more days to break through.<br/><br/>“Alright, be careful. Currently, the entire Lich Kingdom is in a state of alert. There might be a level 8 universe knight guarding this place.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian reminded them.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Mo Sha and the rest nodded. Then, they moved and disappeared quickly.<br/><br/>An Lie, who was at the side, also moved and disappeared slowly.<br/><br/>Wang Xian sat in the room and made a cup of tea. He was waiting for the news with a smile on his face.<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>At this moment, he received a message from Prime Minister Gui. When he saw this message, he narrowed his eyes slightly.<br/><br/>“Is he taking revenge now?”<br/><br/>He murmured.<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>At this moment, in the territory of the ancient sea race, a huge sky-devouring centipede was flying forward rapidly.<br/><br/>“Lord Lich King, the power of the Dragon Palace is in front of us!”<br/><br/>A subordinate reported to the Lich King with the Demon Dragon’s head.<br/><br/>“All the experts of the Lich Kingdom, get ready. As long as you are a disciple of the Dragon Palace, kill anyone you see!”<br/><br/>The Lich King roared with a grim expression.<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>The other experts of the Lich Kingdom roared with grim expressions.<br/><br/>They stared at the spot in front of them with cold eyes.<br/><br/>It had been a month since the Dragon Palace had destroyed the ancient sea race and the righteous God race.<br/><br/>Although the treasures of the righteous God race had been taken away by the experts of the Lich Kingdom, the prestige of the Dragon Palace had been damaged.<br/><br/>However, the position of the Dragon Palace in the surrounding Lu Xingkong was still at the Overlord level.<br/><br/>After the Dragon Palace came to the ancient sea race, a large number of forces in the surrounding Lu Xingkong came to visit every day.<br/><br/>Even those forces that were far away also came to send gifts.<br/><br/>After all, the strength that the Dragon Palace had displayed made all the forces in the surrounding Lu Xingkong extremely fearful.<br/><br/>They had sent the congratulatory gifts to give the Dragon Palace a good impression. If any reckless disciples offended the dragon palace, there was still room for maneuver.<br/><br/>Today, more than a dozen forces from the ocean, the main planet of the Ancient Sea Race, also came to visit the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“It’s a pity that we didn’t see the Dragon King. However, the Dragon Palace is indeed as the other forces said. They are quite kind and not too strong!”<br/><br/>“That’s right, be it the Dragon Queen or the powerful warriors of the Dragon Palace, they are all quite friendly. This is also good news for us!”<br/><br/>“The Dragon King’s strength should have reached universe Knight Level 8 right? I wonder when the Dragon Palace will start the landing battle!”<br/><br/>In the sky above the Dragon Palace, more than 10 powers and over 1,000 powerful warriors came out from the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>They were all smiling.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>All of a sudden, a terrifying power rushed over, making all of them feel breathless and pale.<br/><br/>“What’s going on?”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
