The difficulty was that it required the fragment of the god of elements as a primer.<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not lack a primer.<br/><br/>He could definitely create a holy land for cultivation that was more powerful than the saint of Heaven’s good and the rest.<br/><br/>The effect was several times that of the tree of Chaos!<br/><br/>Setting up a cultivation ground in the riot zone would allow the improvement of the disciples of the Dragon Palace to be faster.<br/><br/>When the time came, they would be able to support the tree of chaos and produce four to five powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin realm. It shouldn’t be a problem.<br/><br/>There might even be more of them.<br/><br/>Of course, the main reason why there were so many powerhouses was because the resources that Wang Xian provided were too precious!<br/><br/>Having made up his mind, Wang Xian brought him to planet justice.<br/><br/>The last time Wang Xian came, he bought a house on Planet Justice League and set up a demonic altar there.<br/><br/>It was to make it easier for Wang Xian to come to planet Justice League in the future.<br/><br/>Now, it was really useful!<br/><br/>Under an Lie’s teleportation, Wang Xian arrived at planet justice.<br/><br/>He took out his Tianyuan Communicator and searched for information on the riot zone.<br/><br/>He wanted to see if there would be a chain reaction after he took away the primal chaos stone.<br/><br/>When he saw the information in the Tian Yuan communicator, his eyes flashed.<br/><br/>According to the discussions of the experts, nothing unexpected happened in the riot zone.<br/><br/>On the contrary, because of the previous incident in the riot zone, the riot zone had become more stable.<br/><br/>Some factions were prepared to lead their disciples to the riot zone to cultivate.<br/><br/>Especially that principle.<br/><br/>Wang Xian discovered that within a short period of time, the path that was formed due to special reasons was known as the Great Dao of reaching heaven.<br/><br/>By channeling the energy on both sides of the Great Dao of reaching heaven, one could create a top-notch cultivation treasure ground.<br/><br/>This also caused many factions to head to the riot zone to investigate.<br/><br/>Wang Xian read through the information one by one and had some understanding in his heart.<br/><br/>“An lie, follow me for the time being.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian instructed an lie and kept it into the mother nest.<br/><br/>Following that, Wang Xian rushed towards the riot zone.<br/><br/>He shuttled through the void rapidly. After a few thousand years, Wang Xian arrived at the front of the riot zone.<br/><br/>“Looks like I should build more devil spirit altars in the future. This will save me a lot of time.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself.<br/><br/>He continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>When he got closer to the riot zone, he discovered that there were many more powerful disciples in this area compared to the last time.<br/><br/>There were many floating islands.<br/><br/>There were many huge battleships.<br/><br/>There were palaces that were emitting a powerful aura.<br/><br/>Wang Xian even saw an extremely huge ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin.<br/><br/>Yes, it was a treasure of the Heaven’s origin.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was filled with astonishment.<br/><br/>“It seems that the changes in the riot zone have attracted many forces.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian scanned the area and couldn’t help but look at the huge treasure of the Heaven’s origin.<br/><br/>It was a treasure of the Heaven’s origin that was similar to an ancient sailboat.<br/><br/>A huge flag was floating on it.<br/><br/>There were words on the flag.<br/><br/>Even if Wang Xian couldn’t read the words, he could understand the meaning with a scan of his mind.<br/><br/>The ultimate sect!<br/><br/>This was the name of this faction.<br/><br/>Wang Xian also realized that in the Justice Union, the powerful factions all claimed to be the ultimate sect.<br/><br/>A faction that could use the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin as an aircraft was definitely extremely powerful!<br/><br/>Wang Xian didn’t pay too much attention to it and flew straight in.<br/><br/>“The change in the riot zone this time is huge. I heard that even the energy in the core area of the cross primordial spirit has calmed down a lot and is much gentler. I wonder what happened?”<br/><br/>“Who knows? The changes in the riot zone must be hard for people like the sect leader to know the reason. However, this is a good thing for us!”<br/><br/>“Yes, it is indeed a good thing. The energy in the riot zone is extremely gentle now. The Great Dao of Heaven is basically a holy land for cultivation. I heard that many great sects have started to set up their facilities there!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian arrived in front of the Great Dao of heaven, he realized that there were a large number of strong disciples around him.<br/><br/>This number was somewhat unbelievable in the chaos.<br/><br/>With a glance, he could see a few thousand people.<br/><br/>“HMM? The changes in this chaotic area are much greater than I imagined.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled. It seemed that there were changes again during the time he flew over.<br/><br/>Furthermore, when Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings, he actually discovered an expert in the ruler realm.<br/><br/>It was completely nonsensical for an expert in the ruler realm to come here previously.<br/><br/>Just that terrifying energy pressure was enough to make it difficult for them to move an inch.<br/><br/>Any stone that flew out would be able to annihilate them.<br/><br/>But now, there were quite a few rulers.<br/><br/>And some rulers even directly floated in the air, absorbing energy.<br/><br/>In this Great Dao of heaven, even if one didn’t rely on the Elemental God to set up a formation to absorb energy, it was still a top-tier cultivation treasure ground.<br/><br/>It was even higher than the tree of Chaos!<br/><br/>“The surrounding energy is indeed much more stable. No wonder so many disciples have come.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the two sides of the Great Dao of Tongtian and felt that the energy was extremely gentle.<br/><br/>This made him extremely surprised.<br/><br/>One had to know that the last time when he and Old Man Song Pagoda Sword were flying here, Chaos Stones would fly out from time to time.<br/><br/>“Does this have anything to do with me taking away the primal Chaos Stones?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian guessed in his heart.<br/><br/>He continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>When he discovered some forces, they began to set up palaces, set up formations, and build cultivation treasures here.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked around curiously and continued to fly in.<br/><br/>He was not in a hurry to set up a paradise here. Instead, he was prepared to explore the surroundings.<br/><br/>In addition, he would make a trip to the cross-shaped primordial spirit region to see if there were any special changes there.<br/><br/>After flying for more than ten days, Wang Xian arrived at the end of the Great Dao of heaven.<br/><br/>At the end of the Great Dao, there was originally an incomparably violent quicksand.<br/><br/>In the end, although it was also quicksand, it was much gentler.<br/><br/>After Wang Xian entered the area, he felt that even a powerhouse who had just entered the Heaven’s origin realm would be able to withstand it.<br/><br/>“What a huge change!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was astonished as he continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>“I wonder if I will meet that spirit kneader?”<br/><br/>“If there’s a chance in the future, I will definitely make you pay the price. HMPH!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought of the three spirit kneader who attacked him. He narrowed his eyes slightly. He would remember this grudge.<br/><br/>He would get his revenge sooner or later!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
