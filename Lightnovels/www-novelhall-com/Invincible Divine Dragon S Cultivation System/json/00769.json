However, the foundation of a peak-level supremacy will be terrifying in the future!”<br/><br/>Looking at the corpses in front of him, Wang Xian revealed a smile.<br/><br/>The Dragon Palace was now a peak race. There were only a dozen or so disciples of the ruler-level.<br/><br/>Although they could not be compared to the peak-level races, the Dragon Palace would be able to add more than a million disciples of the peak-level supremacy after this.<br/><br/>With more than one million disciples at this realm, even if one out of ten disciples could break through to the Overlord realm, the Dragon Palace would be able to quickly accumulate 100,000 disciples at the Overlord Realm!<br/><br/>“There are still billions of years before the arrival of the calamity. If we develop well in these billions of years, the Dragon Palace will rise to a terrifying level!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>He informed an lie and ordered him to bring the corpses back. He also asked about Prime Minister Gui.<br/><br/>Currently, the Dragon Palace was hidden in a very secret place. With the teleportation of the Dark Lie Void Pagoda, there were no traces left behind.<br/><br/>Even if the powerhouses of the Phoenix clan wanted to search for the Dragon Palace, it would be difficult to find it.<br/><br/>Moreover, even if they found it, with the current defense of the Dragon Palace, they would be able to withstand it for a while.<br/><br/>Unless the other party sent out an existence at the Heaven’s origin level.<br/><br/>In short, there was no problem with the Dragon Palace’s consolation.<br/><br/>After an lie left with the corpse and resources, he looked at the metal in front of him.<br/><br/>With a move of his palm, the five elements millstone appeared at the side. Wang Xian began to help the five elements millstone absorb the metal meteorites.<br/><br/>Time passed very quickly. It was located in the nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>In the Dragon Transformation Pool of the dragon palace, Dragon species and divine dragons were roaring. Their powerful aura surged towards the surroundings.<br/><br/>Each and every member of the Dragon Palace had advanced to the peak of the venerable realm. They were only one step away from the ruler realm!<br/><br/>There were eight million members of the Dragon Palace, but one-eighth of them were all at the peak of the venerable realm.<br/><br/>If this were to be publicized, it would definitely shock the entire nine-origin universe.<br/><br/>In fact, if those high-level races were to find out about this, they would definitely be dumbfounded.<br/><br/>Even if all the powerhouses from the high-level races were added together, there wouldn’t be one million at the peak of the venerable realm.<br/><br/>Time passed day by day, and the improvement of the Dragon Palace was very fast.<br/><br/>On Wang Xian’s side, the five elements Millstone had achieved a breakthrough after a few years and reached the level of a ruler at the fifth stage. All of this was within expectations.<br/><br/>This was because the five elements millstone, which had absorbed the frost metal, was already very, very close to a breakthrough.<br/><br/>It was normal for it to achieve a breakthrough now.<br/><br/>Other than that, Wang Xian estimated the remaining metal. It would be a little difficult for him to improve it.<br/><br/>The Five Elements Millstone had reached the level of a dominator at level five while the Tai Chi Dragon Plate was at the level of a dominator at level four.<br/><br/>As he continued to absorb the frost metal, time passed quickly.<br/><br/>“Buzz Buzz Buzz.”<br/><br/>“Dragon King, we have been discovered. An expert has entered!”<br/><br/>A few thousand years had passed. Wang Xian, who was helping the five elements millstone absorb, suddenly received a message from Lin Wenluo.<br/><br/>Sounds of alarm could be heard from his surroundings as well.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was slightly taken aback. He immediately flew out and scanned his surroundings while his eyes flickered.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>In his line of sight, there were numerous small spaceships and robots flying over.<br/><br/>“What’s the situation?”<br/><br/>He looked over and his gaze landed on the robots and mechs. He asked Lin Wenluo.<br/><br/>“They are scientists from our sci-fi world. It should be ke LISFU.”<br/><br/>Lin Wenluo stared at the robot in front of him. His expression changed. “Although this simulated space beast of mine can fool the experts from other races, it can’t fool the scientists from our sci-fi World.”<br/><br/>“They’re here, so be it. Let them enter directly.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked over and said faintly.<br/><br/>Now, he was not as strong as before. It would not be so easy to snatch this place away from him.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Lin Wenluo nodded. He had naturally seen some of the information in the communication stone plate.<br/><br/>He was shocked and pleasantly surprised at the current strength of the Dragon King.<br/><br/>At the very least, cooperating with such a strong person would bring him great benefits.<br/><br/>The only thing that he had to worry about was the Phoenix clan.<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>With Wang Xian’s words, Lin Wenluo’s figure moved and flew forward. “Ke LISFU, it’s you, right?”<br/><br/>“Oh? I was wondering who set up this place. So It’s you, Lin Wenluo!”<br/><br/>Lin Wenluo flew forward, and a mech came up to greet him.<br/><br/>The tall mech was shining, and the two of them faced each other from a distance.<br/><br/>“Kristen, this place has already been occupied by me. You leave this place immediately.”<br/><br/>Lin Wenluo stared at the mech in front of him and said coldly.<br/><br/>“Hehe, scientist Lin Wenluo, you are still as childish as before. You occupy a piece of land, and it belongs to you? I even said that this place has been occupied by me.”<br/><br/>A mocking expression appeared on Kleis’face as he looked around. “It seems that you have been here for a long time. You should have gained a lot.”<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Lin Wenluo stared at him, his eyes slightly flickering.<br/><br/>“Don’t be surprised. This space meteorite contains powerful metals. I already knew about it a hundred thousand years ago. However, I went to the place where the meteorite fell to look for it. Now, I have almost found it, so I came to look at the source. I didn’t expect that the source had already been occupied by you!”<br/><br/>Crestford said indifferently.<br/><br/>“Crestford, I advise you to leave this place. You’re not my opponent.”<br/><br/>Lin Wenluo stared at him and said with a dark face!<br/><br/>“Why do we have to be opponents? Can’t we do research together like before?”<br/><br/>Crestford said indifferently.<br/><br/>“I, Lin Wenluo, don’t want to be in cahoots with the lackeys of the peak race!”<br/><br/>Lin Wenluo said coldly!<br/><br/>“Haha, Lin Wenluo, you are too high and mighty. You know the shortcomings of our technological world. It is impossible for us to take that step by ourselves. You do not know the true terror of the peak race. Now, I will give you a chance to join the angel race with me. You will not regret it!”<br/><br/>Crestford laughed out loud!<br/><br/>“The Angel Clan? HMPH!”<br/><br/>Lin Wenluo snorted coldly.<br/><br/>“If you are not willing to join, then leave this place immediately. I now announce that this is my territory.”<br/><br/>Crestford said with a smile, his gaze fixed on Lin Wenluo!<br/><br/>“The one who should get lost is you!”<br/><br/>Lin Wenluo said coldly!<br/><br/>“Alright, I’ll show you my strength today!”<br/><br/>Crestleaf smiled coldly and waved his arm.<br/><br/>Metal Battle Angels suddenly appeared beside him.<br/><br/>There were four metal battle angels with twelve wings.<br/><br/>“Humph!”<br/><br/>Lin Wenluo snorted and also waved his arm. A green metal beast appeared in front of him and stared at Crestleaf coldly!<br/><br/>“It seems like you have obtained quite a number of powerful metals!”<br/><br/>Crestfall looked over as his eyes sparkled.<br/><br/>At the back, Wang Xian was watching their fight. He raised his eyebrows slightly and watched quietly.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
