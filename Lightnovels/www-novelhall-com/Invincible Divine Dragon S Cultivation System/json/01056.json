Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>“Divine Dragons, you deserve to die, deserve to die! ”<br/><br/>Agar stared at Wang Xian with his face filled with anger and unwillingness!<br/><br/>He couldn’t help but roar furiously!<br/><br/>He was filled with unwillingness!<br/><br/>Yes, he was extremely unwilling at the moment!<br/><br/>Now, he was already severely injured. Initially, he wanted to kill some powerhouses and living beings in the sword and magic universe before he died. However, he didn’t expect that he would still be stopped by Wang Xian in the end!<br/><br/>Today, if it wasn’t for Wang Xian, he wouldn’t have died either!<br/><br/>He wouldn’t have fallen either!<br/><br/>It wasn’t easy for him to revive his second life. It wasn’t easy for him to break through to the Heaven’s origin blessed realm once again! This time, once he was destroyed, he would be gone forever.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! ”<br/><br/>He roared unwillingly, but there was nothing he could do.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the Agar Heavenly Demon God who was filled with unwillingness. A cold expression appeared on his face.<br/><br/>With a wave of his arm, he transformed into a dragon claw and attacked the face of the Agar Heavenly Demon God.<br/><br/>The Dragon Claw instantly tore apart the final attack of the Asgardian demon “Kill him completely! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian let out a wild roar. The huge axe in his hand slashed at the body parts of the Asgardian demon god.<br/><br/>The terrifying golden glow enveloped the Asgardian demon god and completely melted his energy.<br/><br/>Wang Xian also moved his body and attacked the body parts of the Asgardian demon god!<br/><br/>“Phew, that Lord Wang Xian has the ability to teleport. He teleported back to his other body. ”<br/><br/>“He’s really powerful. He teleported back to his own body at such a long distance. It’s fortunate that Lord Wang Xian is here! ”<br/><br/>“This time, Long yinyin has really soared into the sky. This lord Wang Xian is a terrifying existence that is comparable to the fate of the Heaven’s origin. Although he is not an expert from our universe, he is able to come to our universe and possess such terrifying strength. Even if it’s a calamity, no expert would dare to provoke him! ”<br/><br/>“That’s right. Long yinyin has indeed soared to the sky this time. Why don’t I have such good luck?”<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, a group of frightened strong disciples from the sacred grounds and the forbidden grounds heaved a sigh of relief when they saw that the crisis had been resolved!<br/><br/>They looked at Wang Xian’s figure and then looked at long yinyin. Their faces were filled with envy!<br/><br/>To be able to be together with this existence, he had really soared to the sky!<br/><br/>Who would dare to provoke him in the future?<br/><br/>He had truly soared to the sky!<br/><br/>At this moment, Long Yinyin still had a shocked expression on her face.<br/><br/>She couldn’t believe it.<br/><br/>She couldn’t believe that Wang Xian was such a terrifying powerhouse.<br/><br/>Now, he was even ganging up with two legendary figures from the sword and Magic Universe to kill a powerhouse at the Heaven’s origin creation level.<br/><br/>This made her feel a little dazed!<br/><br/>In front of her, hopeless sky and Liu Lan’s furious roars rang out!<br/><br/>The vitality of every part of the Agar Heavenly Demon’s body was diminishing.<br/><br/>The vitality of every part of his body was dissipating rapidly!<br/><br/>Wang Xian also quickly kept every part of the Agar Heavenly Demon ‘s body.<br/><br/>Even his blood was not spared.<br/><br/>Even a drop of blood from the body of a heaven origin creator would contain an extremely terrifying energy!<br/><br/>When Lin Niu saw this scene, he revealed an excited expression!<br/><br/>Next, if he could devour all the bodies of the Asgard Celestial Demon, the possibility of him breaking through was very, very high!<br/><br/>It could even be said that it would not be long before he could break through to the Heaven Origin Creation Stage!<br/><br/>At this realm, he would truly transcend.<br/><br/>He would truly possess endless lifespan.<br/><br/>Eternal Life!<br/><br/>Complete Eternal Life!<br/><br/>Even if it was a calamity, as long as he wanted to survive, it would be extremely easy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, at this level, it was too difficult to die!<br/><br/>Just like the Asgard Heavenly Demon God, he was completely exterminated this time by accident.<br/><br/>It was all due to his arrogance. On top of that, he had died once!<br/><br/>The main body of the Asgard Celestial Demon had already died. He had left behind a chess piece which allowed him to revive his second life in the universe of Sword and Magic!<br/><br/>As long as the Heaven’s origin creator was careful and had more arrangements, it would be too difficult to completely exterminate him!<br/><br/>He was about to step into the Heaven’s origin creation!<br/><br/>In the sky ahead, the battle between Wang Xian and the rest was coming to an end bit by bit.<br/><br/>After the vitality of the bodies of the Asgard Heavenly Demon God was destroyed one by one, the resistance that his remaining body could unleash was getting weaker and weaker!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>When Wang Xian grabbed an eye in his hand.<br/><br/>At the side, Liu Lan and hopeless sky had also completely destroyed the other limbs of the Asgard Heavenly Demon God!<br/><br/>From then on, an existence at the heavenly yuan creation level was completely destroyed!<br/><br/>“I can’t sense any life force or aura from the Asgard Heavenly Demon God. He has been completely destroyed by us! ”<br/><br/>Liu Lan sensed the surroundings and said excitedly!<br/><br/>“Destroyed, hahaha, we have finally destroyed him. The countless undead in the sword and magic universe can finally rest in peace! ”<br/><br/>Hopeless Heaven could not help but laugh maniacally. His expression was filled with excitement.<br/><br/>He had experienced that dark and turbulent time.<br/><br/>The Asgardian demon God had brought too much darkness to their universe.<br/><br/>Now, he had gotten his revenge!<br/><br/>“Thank you, Dragon King, for your help! ”<br/><br/>Hopeless Heaven looked at Wang Xian, cupped his hands, and thanked him!<br/><br/>“Thank you, Dragon King, for your help! ” Liu Lan also said gratefully!<br/><br/>“No need. We are just doing business.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled at them. His gaze swept across the limbs of the Aga<br/><br/>Heavenly Demon God. With a wave of his arm, he retrieved them one by one!<br/><br/>Liu Lan and Wang Xian did not touch the limbs of the Aga Heavenly Demon God.<br/><br/>After all, they had a small conflict with Wang Xian just now.<br/><br/>Since Wang Xian was willing to help them, he asked for the body of the Aga Heavenly Demon God.<br/><br/>In order to prevent Wang Xian from disliking them, they didn’t take any limbs or blood from the Aga Heavenly Demon God!<br/><br/>After the complete limbs of the Aga Heavenly Demon God were taken back, his face revealed an excited expression!<br/><br/>“Lin Niu, come over! ”<br/><br/>He shouted softly and his voice was transmitted to linniu!<br/><br/>“Boss, I’m here, I’m Here!”<br/><br/>Linniu flew over with an excited and excited expression on his face and knelt down in the air!<br/><br/>“Thank you boss, Thank You Boss! ”<br/><br/>He knelt down and worshiped Wang Xian incoherently as he shouted loudly!<br/><br/>“How long will it take for you to break through?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and the corpse of the Asgardian demon god flew in front of him.<br/><br/>“Boss, are you alright?”He asked Lin Niu with a smile on his face!<br/><br/>“Boss, it will take about 100 million years. 100 million years should be enough!”<br/><br/>Lin Niu took the body of the Asgardian demon god and replied loudly with a burning gaze!<br/><br/>“Boss, in the future, even if I, the old bull, break through to the Heaven’s origin creation realm, I will follow your lead. Anyone who wants to hurt you will have to step over my body!”<br/><br/>“Thank you, boss, for bringing me to the Heavenly Yuan Destiny Realm. I will<br/><br/>repay you with MY DEATH! ” Lin Bull promised gratefully!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
