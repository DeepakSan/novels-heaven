As long as we destroy him, everything will be much easier.”<br/><br/>The elder wearing a bamboo hat and covered in blood-red said with a ghastly expression!<br/><br/>“I can sense that there’s a primal chaos level existence in the universe ahead. It should be the Dragon Palace Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The primal chaos level existence with countless tentacles connected to his head said coldly!<br/><br/>“Do it!”<br/><br/>The Lord of disaster condensed a huge, terrifying and malevolent face and stared at the nine-origin universe!<br/><br/>As soon as he finished speaking, a group of figures immediately stepped into the nine-origin universe, locked onto the nest of the Dragon Palace, and flew quickly.<br/><br/>The spiritual sky job and the illusory realm looked forward with excitement.<br/><br/>Today was the day that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace would pay a terrible price!<br/><br/>This was the end of offending the evil sequence alignment camp!<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Alliance master, according to the information we received, the experts of the evil sequence alignment camp are about to arrive at the land of origin, and they are going to fight the Dragon Palace Alliance!”<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace Alliance has also confirmed that the evil sequence faction is about to launch an attack on them, but the Dragon Palace Alliance doesn’t seem to be in too much of a panic, nor did they call for help!”<br/><br/>In the universe of justice, the experts from the Justice Alliance reported to their alliance master.<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>The Alliance Master of the Justice Alliance was a little surprised when he received the news.<br/><br/>In terms of strength, although the Dragon Palace alliance wasn’t weak, they should be much weaker than the evil sequence faction.<br/><br/>“If the evil sequence faction wants to deal with the Dragon Palace Alliance, they have to deal with that Dragon King. Let’s continue to keep an eye on him.”<br/><br/>The leader of the Justice Alliance had a contemplative look on his face as he spoke!<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Are they here?”<br/><br/>At the same time, in the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian sensed something when the aura of the four chaos-level powerhouses entered the nine-origin universe!<br/><br/>His eyes flickered and a smile appeared on his face!<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved his body and concealed his entire aura. He waited quietly.<br/><br/>All the powerful disciples of the Dragon Palace had entered the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>They were also looking at their surroundings in astonishment!<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>The four chaos-level powerhouses from the evil sequence camp were very fast.<br/><br/>Soon, they appeared in the sky above the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The four figures didn’t give off terrifying auras.<br/><br/>They were in four different directions, and the entire dragon palace was completely sealed under their energy coverage!<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>When they hovered above the Dragon Palace and saw the palace below, they were stunned.<br/><br/>They were chaos-level existences, so they could naturally see the extraordinariness of the dragon palace at a glance.<br/><br/>The terrifying power it contained.<br/><br/>The terrifying energy it emitted.<br/><br/>It made them feel extremely shocked.<br/><br/>They were chaos-level existences, the strongest existences in the evil sequence camp.<br/><br/>What treasure hadn’t they seen before?<br/><br/>But when they looked at the Dragon Palace buildings below, they were still extremely shaken!<br/><br/>All of them were Palace-type Heavenly Yuan creation treasures. How was this possible?<br/><br/>Sword Demon Axe widened his eyes and stared at the Heavenly Yuan creation treasure below in disbelief!<br/><br/>“What kind of fortune did the dragon palace obtain to have so many heavenly Yuan creation treasures?”<br/><br/>The elder wearing the bamboo hat also muttered, and his eyes revealed a burning expression!<br/><br/>“There’s a primal chaos level existence below. It’s the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. Let’s kill him first!”<br/><br/>The Lord of Disaster’s gaze was also fixed on the Dragon Palace building below. Following which, he looked at his six subordinates and said, “I’ll leave the other disciples of the Dragon Palace to you!”<br/><br/>“It’s the four lords!”<br/><br/>The Spirit Kneader and the others immediately replied!<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>The next moment, the four primal chaos level existences from the evil sequence faction, who were located in the four directions of the Dragon Palace, trembled.<br/><br/>A surge of energy gushed out from their bodies and sealed off the surroundings!<br/><br/>They wanted to completely seal off the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>“You’re courting death!”<br/><br/>In the Dragon King Palace, Wang Xian looked at the four powerhouses from the evil sequence faction. His eyes were filled with killing intent.<br/><br/>At this moment, a shadow of a black fog appeared in front of him.<br/><br/>This black shadow was the aura of the Lord of calamity.<br/><br/>From what Wang Xian could sense, this black shadow was the strongest existence.<br/><br/>Wang Xian wanted to kill it first!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>He stretched out his hand and grabbed at the Black Shadow. Following that, an extremely powerful energy surged into the Black Fog!<br/><br/>At this moment, a terrifying energy sealed off the entire Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>All the disciples of the Dragon Palace looked outside with cold eyes.<br/><br/>“It’s the experts of the evil array faction. These damn guys!”<br/><br/>“They dare to invade our Dragon Palace. HMPH, their doomsday is coming!”<br/><br/>“A bunch of reckless guys!”<br/><br/>The experts of the Dragon Palace said coldly.<br/><br/>After witnessing the strength of their Dragon King, they didn’t feel any fear or worry towards the experts of the evil sequence alignment camp.<br/><br/>The Nine Heavens Divine Roc stood in the Dragon Palace and watched as this terrifying energy slowly flew out of a palace.<br/><br/>He flapped his flaming wings and looked coldly at the four fellows who were courting death!<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>When the nine-sky Divine Roc came out, the four evil-sequence experts immediately looked at him in surprise.<br/><br/>“Is this the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>They were shocked. According to their understanding, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace didn’t look like this!<br/><br/>“He’s not the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, but his power is so strong!”<br/><br/>The Spirit Kneader and the others looked at the Nine Heavens Divine Roc and were slightly shocked.<br/><br/>They had a deep grudge with the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, so they knew that he wasn’t the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>However, his terrifying power wasn’t weaker than their lord of the primal Chaos Realm.<br/><br/>Who was he?<br/><br/>Why was he in the Dragon Palace?<br/><br/>“Ah!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a scream came from the Lord of Disaster’s mouth!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
