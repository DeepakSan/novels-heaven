There was a hint of doubt on their faces.<br/><br/>Suddenly, Wang Xian sensed two figures attacking his direction.<br/><br/>One of the figures was located underground.<br/><br/>The other figure was moving at a terrifying speed. It was flying towards him in a special state.<br/><br/>With the special figure in front of him, the figure in the ground clearly had some misgivings.<br/><br/>The latter knew about Wang Xian’s existence!<br/><br/>“The Ultimate Treasure of Tianyuan is mine now. With the treasure in my hands, as long as I can get my hands on it, I can immediately return to my own universe! ”<br/><br/>Shui Sha was faintly locking onto tianci, and the energy in his body had reached its limit.<br/><br/>He was a water-elemental master of Tianyuan.<br/><br/>Similarly, he had stayed in the six paths universe for over a hundred million years in order to search for the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan.<br/><br/>This was the first time he came into close contact with the ultimate treasure of<br/><br/>Tianyuan.<br/><br/>He had to get it!<br/><br/>As long as he got it, with his secret technique, he could return to his own universe in an instant.<br/><br/>However, when he arrived tens of meters away from tianci in an instant, he was suddenly shocked.<br/><br/>Through his senses, he instantly sensed that Wang Xian was a powerhouse of<br/><br/>Tianyuan.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>He didn’t even hesitate for a moment. Even when he sensed that there was a heaven’s origin creator beside the young man who was hiding the Heaven ‘s origin creator’s treasure, he didn’t pause for a moment.<br/><br/>He continued to attack Tianci.<br/><br/>The Earth Element Heaven’s origin creator who came underground with Bai Ke Fu Sheng didn’t make a move.<br/><br/>It was because he knew of Wang Xian’s existence.<br/><br/>He knew of Wang Xian’s strength.<br/><br/>Splash<br/><br/>The moves of the heaven origin creator were all instantaneous.<br/><br/>On the arena, a palm formed by water currents appeared in front of tianci. At the same time, numerous water snakes attacked Wang Xian directly.<br/><br/>“Attack!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this scene, his eyes focused and his body shook. He completely ignored the attacks of the water snakes.<br/><br/>At the same time, the figure of the Unicorn ox appeared instantly and attacked the water snakes at the same time!<br/><br/>Around Wang Xian, the Tai Chi Dragon Disc was spinning and directly broke through the water snakes.<br/><br/>The attack of the Unicorn ox also destroyed the palm that was trying to grab Tian Chi.<br/><br/>The distance between the two parties was too close for experts of their level!<br/><br/>This was equivalent to a close combat battle!<br/><br/>With the breakthrough of the Taiji Dragon Plate, Wang Xian could completely ignore any attacks from the opponent with the Taiji Dragon Plate.<br/><br/>Wang Xian wanted to kill the opponent in an instant.<br/><br/>His body was comparable to an old-timer who had just entered the Heaven’s origin creation stage. In addition, Lin Niu was an old-timer who had entered the Heaven’s origin creation stage.<br/><br/>In addition, there was the existence of the Taiji dragon plate and the great grinding of the five elements. At such a close distance, Wang Xian was confident that he could kill the opponent in an instant.<br/><br/>“There’s another Heaven’s origin creation stage expert? Why are there two Heaven’s origin creation stage experts beside this young man who has the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation stage?”<br/><br/>Shui Shayin’s expression changed drastically when he saw Wang Xian instantly defeating his attack and the sudden appearance of the Unicorn Ox.<br/><br/>“Damn it, what’s going on?”<br/><br/>His expression changed drastically and he wanted to retreat.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian was not prepared to let him retreat at this moment!<br/><br/>Wang Xian rushed over. His arm turned into a dragon claw and he hugged Shui Shayin directly!<br/><br/>Nine types of elemental energy sealed the space around him directly.<br/><br/>“You ‘re courting death! ”<br/><br/>Shui Sha could vaguely see that Wang Xian wanted to keep him here. A cold and ruthless look appeared in his eyes!<br/><br/>With a move of his palm, a spear appeared in front of him. With a move of his body, he instantly merged into the body of the spear and shot backward!<br/><br/>Once he was stopped, he would definitely be penetrated by the divine spear.<br/><br/>The penetration power of the water attribute was extremely terrifying!<br/><br/>“Since you’re here, don’t Leave! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian snorted coldly. He completely ignored the penetrative force of the divine spear and enveloped it.<br/><br/>At the same time, the fragment of the Starfield spun above his head and sealed the space!<br/><br/>A root penetrated into the water sand and his body.<br/><br/>The same root had taken root.<br/><br/>This was a root that Wang Xian had taken out recently while the Tianyuan destiny-level treasure in his body was undamaged.<br/><br/>When the same root rooted into the enemy’s body, it could be perfectly controlled.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian sent the same root into his body, it wasn’t to control him. Instead, it was to prevent the enemy from using a powerful treasure to escape.<br/><br/>Similarly, the Starfield Fragment’s space lock was also to prevent the enemy from escaping.<br/><br/>When everything was activated, the divine spear instantly pierced into the Taiji dragon plate.<br/><br/>A terrifying collision sound was heard instantly.<br/><br/>“What? What kind of treasure is this?”<br/><br/>Shui Shayin was shocked when he saw that his attack was completely blocked.<br/><br/>His escape technique was not only fast, but it was also exceptionally difficult to stop it.<br/><br/>This was especially so when Wang Xian wanted to use his own body to block it. The penetration of the water attribute allowed him to easily penetrate the body of any enemy.<br/><br/>However, this time, he was blocked! “Break! ”<br/><br/>Shui Shayin’s eyes focused. The powerful water energy in his body surged. The tip of the divine spear started to spin, trying to break through the defense of the Taiji Dragon Plate.<br/><br/>As a veteran powerhouse who had just entered the Heaven’s origin realm, his strength was still very terrifying.<br/><br/>The Taiji Dragon Plate was unable to withstand his attack!<br/><br/>A hole appeared and the divine spear continued to pierce through Wang Xian’s body.<br/><br/>The divine spear penetrated into Wang Xian’s body, but there was no fluctuation from Wang Xian.<br/><br/>The ancestral tree that was about to reach maturity gave Wang Xian a terrifying recovery effect..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
