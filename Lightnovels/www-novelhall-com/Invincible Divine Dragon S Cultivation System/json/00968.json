Wang Xian felt an energy enveloping him!<br/><br/>At the next moment, he appeared on a stage in front of him!<br/><br/>The figure of the Master of the Forbidden Ground also appeared in front of him!<br/><br/>In front of her, there was a special crown suspended!<br/><br/>The towering crown of the Saint!<br/><br/>“This time, after Yin Yinhao, the Saintess and Saint Son, the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground has welcomed its second saint son. He is also the most talented saint son. The name of the Saint Son is Wang Xian. Today, I am the Saint Son of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground. All the powerful disciples of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground shall obey the orders of the Saint Son!”<br/><br/>“Holy son, he represents the future, reputation, and power of the Dragon Roar<br/><br/>Forbidden Ground. He shall not be blasphemed or offended! ”<br/><br/>As the Master of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground spoke, his voice reverberated across the entire sky of the island!<br/><br/>“Today’s coronation! ”<br/><br/>The Master of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground continued to speak. He picked up the towering crown of the holy son in front of him and slowly stood on top of Wang Xian’s Head! “Greetings, holy son Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>“Greetings, holy son Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>In the surrounding area of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Land, all the strong disciples below the level of deacons bowed and shouted loudly!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw this scene, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of belonging in his heart!<br/><br/>This kind of ceremony and the importance attached to it. Even he, who had just joined, had a great impression of the dragon roar forbidden land.<br/><br/>“Thank you, everyone. In the future, I will be around. The younger generation of the dragon roar forbidden ground will not lose their prestige! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian faced the group of strong disciples of the dragon roar forbidden ground and replied indifferently.<br/><br/>“Hehe, the younger generation will not lose their prestige. Good! ”<br/><br/>The leader of the dragon roar forbidden ground nodded with a smile. He looked at Wang Xian and said, “According to the rules of our Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground, the holy son needs to show his strength and challenge those of a higher level. Xiao Xian, are you ready?”<br/><br/>“Yes, I am!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded and looked forward.<br/><br/>In front of him, there were more than a thousand masters of the universe who were below level five.<br/><br/>“Give me a space attribute. Those who are at level one of the Masters of the universe, Spar with the Holy Son Wang Xian! ”<br/><br/>The Master of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground also looked down and said.<br/><br/>This was not to make things difficult for Wang Xian, but the process of crowning the holy son.<br/><br/>Furthermore, they all knew that Wang Xian had ascended to the eighth level of the Tower of Moon. It was easy for him to fight above his level!<br/><br/>“Lord Leader of the Forbidden Ground, let me spar with Wang Xian! ”<br/><br/>A middle-aged man moved and came to the front. He bowed to the leader of the Dragon Roar forbidden ground and Wang Xian.<br/><br/>The leader of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground waved his arm and a wave of energy enveloped Wang Xian and the middle-aged man.<br/><br/>Then, he retreated to the side.<br/><br/>“Holy son Wang Xian, please enlighten me! ”<br/><br/>The middle-aged man bowed to Wang Xian again and said.<br/><br/>A sharp sword appeared in his hand. He was also a spatial swordsman!<br/><br/>“Make Your Move First! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian gestured to the middle-aged man!<br/><br/>“Holy son Wang Xian, make your move first. ”<br/><br/>The middle-aged man smiled and gestured to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“If I make my move first, you won’t stand a chance. Take it! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man and said with a smile. With a wave of his arm, Void Sword 90 appeared around him and disappeared instantly!<br/><br/>‘ ‘HA”‘IM?”<br/><br/>When the middle-aged man heard Wang Xian’s confident words, his eyes narrowed and the power of space immediately filled his entire body!<br/><br/>Naturally, he had heard of Wang Xian’s deeds and knew that he was able to fight above his level.<br/><br/>Furthermore, he was able to fight against three people who were stronger than him.<br/><br/>However, this sentence sounded a little too arrogant to the middle-aged man!<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>However, the next second, his gaze focused.<br/><br/>The sharp swords trembled slightly!<br/><br/>The surrounding space began to change drastically!<br/><br/>The middle-aged man sensed this change and his gaze focused slightly.<br/><br/>He felt that the space around him contained a great terror.<br/><br/>It was as if terrifying magical beasts were sleeping!<br/><br/>When the sharp sword attacked him, he felt all the magical beasts wake up and pounce towards him!<br/><br/>This caused his expression to change drastically and he hurriedly waved the sharp sword in his hand.<br/><br/>A huge sword surrounded his surroundings and slashed out!<br/><br/>“Bang Bang Bang! ”<br/><br/>But in the next moment, the spatial energy that he had gathered with all his strength directly collapsed!<br/><br/>The 90 sharp swords continued to attack him.<br/><br/>“Bang Bang! ”<br/><br/>The 90 sharp swords pierced through his surroundings, the defense of the Lord of the Dragon Roar Forbidden Land.<br/><br/>This defense represented a life!<br/><br/>The defense was destroyed, and the 90 sharp swords floated around him, surrounding him!<br/><br/>His pupils constricted slightly and his face revealed a look of horror.<br/><br/>He couldn’t help but take a deep breath!<br/><br/>(‘I really didn’t expect you, Holy Son Wang Yun, to be so terrifying that you could kill me in an instant! ”<br/><br/>His body trembled and he cupped his hands at Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“Your space swords are not pure. Your influence on the surrounding space is too weak. You need to strengthen it.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man and said with a smile!<br/><br/>As soon as he finished his sentence, 90 sharp swords returned to him. With a wave of his arm, he put them away!<br/><br/>“I’ve learned my lesson! ”<br/><br/>The middle-aged man pondered for a moment and nodded his head heavily!<br/><br/>The swords that he loved were indeed not pure.<br/><br/>This had something to do with his proficiency in swordsmanship!<br/><br/>However, being pointed out by the sage Wang Xian in front of him in an instant, he was extremely shocked!<br/><br/>The sage in front of him was too terrifying. He could not be compared to the sage long Yinhao!<br/><br/>“Brother Wang Xian is awesome. Isn’t he too strong?”<br/><br/>Long Yinhao’s shocked exclamation came from the back!<br/><br/>He widened his eyes and could not help but stand up.<br/><br/>This was the first time he saw Wang Xian make a move!<br/><br/>He instantly killed an existence one level higher than him.<br/><br/>Furthermore. he only used the ordinary 90 innate spiritual treasure swords!<br/><br/>He didn’t use any other innate treasures at all.<br/><br/>What kind of concept was this?<br/><br/>His dragon roar was vast. He was able to step into the sixth level of the Moon<br/><br/>Tower, and he was able to step into the seventh level.<br/><br/>That was because he used a desperate forbidden spell!<br/><br/>That was done by piling up a large number of innate treasures.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian didn’t have any powerful treasures. He instantly killed an existence one level higher than him.<br/><br/>It was too terrifying! “He’s indeed so powerful, so terrifying! ”<br/><br/>“What a perverse attack! ”<br/><br/>At the front, the elders and deacons saw this scene and their pupils constricted slightly.<br/><br/>Some of the deacons and elders couldn’t help but stand up.<br/><br/>They naturally saw the battle clearly.<br/><br/>Including all the energy fluctuations!<br/><br/>They naturally knew that the middle-aged man didn’t hold back at all!<br/><br/>Under such circumstances, he was easily killed in an instant.<br/><br/>It could only be said that Wang Xian’s strength was too terrifying!<br/><br/>“Hiss, it can’t be. He killed an existence one level higher than himself in an instant?”<br/><br/>“A peak universe knight who killed an expert at the first level of the Universe Dominator in an instant. And this was even without using any powerful treasures?”<br/><br/>“This… fighting someone of a higher level, isn’t this too easy and casual?”<br/><br/>At this moment, hundreds of millions of disciples couldn’t help exclaiming when they saw this..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
