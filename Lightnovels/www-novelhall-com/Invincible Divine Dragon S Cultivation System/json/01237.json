Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>The clones of Wang Xian, the Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor, and Jiuli flew rapidly into the universe ahead.<br/><br/>They did not hide anything.<br/><br/>As long as Jiuli made a breakthrough, all the powerhouses in the universe would be able to sense it.<br/><br/>Therefore, they did not need to hide anything.<br/><br/>Soon, they stepped into the interior of the Arnold Dao Universe.<br/><br/>Jiuli was wrapped in energy. When he entered this universe, he immediately sensed that he had broken through the shackles.<br/><br/>The next moment, he showed an excited expression.<br/><br/>In this universe, he could make a breakthrough.<br/><br/>Wang Yun and the others stopped in the void and did not go deep into it.<br/><br/>They looked at Jiuli.<br/><br/>“Lord Shadow Demon Emperor, Lord Dragon King, I can make a breakthrough immediately! ”<br/><br/>Jiuli said excitedly!<br/><br/>“Then let’s Make a breakthrough!”<br/><br/>Shadow Demon Emperor looked at Wang Yun and said with a smile!<br/><br/>During the last calamity, their demon race had disciples who could make a breakthrough.<br/><br/>However, due to the war with the Void Universe, Shadow Demon Emperor could not leave the nine-origin universe easily.<br/><br/>That was why he could not help his disciples to make a breakthrough.<br/><br/>However, with Wang Xian around, everything was much simpler.<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood at the side and nodded. “Let’s achieve a breakthrough. Our nine-origin universe will have one more heaven origin creator. ”<br/><br/>“Yes, My Lords! ”<br/><br/>Jiuli nodded. With a move, he immediately flew to the sky.<br/><br/>Rumble<br/><br/>In an instant, the weather changed. A large amount of energy from the entire universe was gathered in this direction.<br/><br/>Breakthrough, begin!<br/><br/>The enormous power pulled at the vibration of the universe.<br/><br/>Such a large disturbance immediately attracted the powerful disciples of this universe.<br/><br/>“What’s the situation?”<br/><br/>On the planet closest to this place, countless creatures looked over, their faces filled with shock.<br/><br/>“What terrifying power, what’s the situation? Could it be that other universe experts have invaded our Arnold Dao Universe?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know. Report to the Lords immediately. Report immediately! ”<br/><br/>The disciple of the Arnold universe immediately reported the situation here.<br/><br/>The calamity had begun, and the various universes had made a large number of arrangements.<br/><br/>Especially, the stronger the universe, the more arrangements there were!<br/><br/>There were three heaven origin creation level powerhouses in the Arnold Universe.<br/><br/>Although they weren’t very strong, they had made a large number of arrangements.<br/><br/>When the terrifying fluctuations came from this side, the three experts sensed something.<br/><br/>Someone wants to make a breakthrough in our Arnold Universe and occupy our Arnold Universe’s quota! ”<br/><br/>“Damn it, let’s go and see who it is that wants to occupy our Arnold Universe’s quota. ”<br/><br/>“Intruders appear, kill! ”<br/><br/>The three heaven origin blessed realm experts growled with gloomy faces.<br/><br/>They did not hesitate at all and directly rushed over through the teleportation array.<br/><br/>When breaking through to the heaven origin creation realm, one could not conceal one’s aura.<br/><br/>One could not hide it from the heaven origin creation realm experts in this universe.<br/><br/>And breaking through in someone else’s universe was an invasion!<br/><br/>No universe would allow such a thing to happen.<br/><br/>The three heaven origin creation realm experts quickly rushed to the nearest place through the teleportation array.<br/><br/>“There are intruders trying to break through before us!”<br/><br/>As they got closer, they were completely sure that someone was trying to snatch the spot in their universe.<br/><br/>This was equivalent to digging up the foundation of their Arnold Universe. The three heaven origin creation realm powerhouses flew over with murderous intent.<br/><br/>The spot where Jiuli broke through.<br/><br/>Wang Xian, the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor, stood at the side and watched quietly.<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian sensed something and looked to the right. “Dragon King, are there any powerhouses here?”<br/><br/>The Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor looked at Wang Xian and asked.<br/><br/>This was just a clone of the Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor. It only had the strength of someone who had just entered the Heaven’s origin realm.<br/><br/>Naturally, its senses were not as good as Wang Xian ‘s.<br/><br/>“They’re here. There are three of them. It shouldn’t be a problem! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head and said!<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>In less than five seconds, three figures appeared in his line of sight!<br/><br/>“You ‘re courting death. How dare you make a breakthrough in our Arnold Universe! ”<br/><br/>The moment the three figures flew over, the figure in the middle roared with a face full of killing intent!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them. With a wave of his arm, an extremely huge phantom image of a dragon head floated in the void and was facing them.<br/><br/>The Phantom image of the dragon head emitted a nine-colored radiance and contained an extremely terrifying aura!<br/><br/>The Phantom image of the Dragon Head did not move. It stared coldly at the three heaven origin creation stage powerhouses.<br/><br/>“Not good!”<br/><br/>The three heaven origin creation stage powerhouses felt the terrifying aura from the phantom image of the Dragon Head. Their expressions changed slightly.<br/><br/>From this phantom image of the dragon head, they could feel the threat of death.<br/><br/>“Oh no, the opponent has a dao protector, and his strength is extremely terrifying! ”<br/><br/>A heavenly fate realm powerhouse from the Arnold Dao Universe had an ugly expression.<br/><br/>Dao Protector.<br/><br/>A Dao Protector for a powerhouse who had broken through.<br/><br/>Under such circumstances, the power of the Dao protector was above the control level!<br/><br/>“Who are you people? How dare you break through in our Arnold Dao Universe? How dare you occupy our Arnold Dao Universe’s quota? Aren’t you afraid of Our Revenge?”<br/><br/>“How strong are you guys? How can you withstand our sneak attack?” The Heaven’s origin creator on the left spoke with a gloomy face.<br/><br/>There was a hint of threat in his tone.<br/><br/>Wang Xian heard it and looked over.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>In the next moment, his body disappeared.<br/><br/>Following that, his body appeared next to the powerhouse who spoke just now.<br/><br/>The powerhouse who spoke was only at the beginner level.<br/><br/>The gap between him and Wang Xian was too huge!<br/><br/>Before he could react, Wang Xian had already appeared in front of him.<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>A terrifying aura pressed down on him. Wang Xian stared at him calmly and said, “If you want a spot, you can leave! ”<br/><br/>“What! You…”<br/><br/>The powerhouse who was in the Heaven’s origin realm trembled violently under the influence of Wang Xian’s aura. His face turned pale. He opened his mouth, and his pupils revealed a look of horror.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s terrifying aura made him tremble.<br/><br/>He arrived in front of him in an instant. Just by relying on his aura alone, he felt his scalp go numb.<br/><br/>This was definitely not something that an existence at the level of control could do.<br/><br/>“An expert at the level of the Great Dao! ”<br/><br/>He let out a low roar in fear and stared at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Wang Xian did not say a word. He quietly flew to his previous position and waited for Jiuli to complete her breakthrough!<br/><br/>“Hiss, it’s an existence at the level of the Great Dao. There’s another powerhouse at the level of the Heaven’s origin. They are not someone we can fight against! ”<br/><br/>“This is a powerful universe. They are here to protect their disciples. ”<br/><br/>The three powerhouses at the level of the Heaven’s origin in the Arnold<br/><br/>Universe looked extremely embarrassed.<br/><br/>They were somewhat powerless.<br/><br/>However, at the same time, they were also somewhat relieved.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the other party did not have any intention of attacking their universe.<br/><br/>If the other party attacked their universe, they would not be able to resist at all..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
