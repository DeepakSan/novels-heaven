Any building is tens of thousands of meters tall. There are some strange birds and beasts flying above it. It’s so magnificent! ”<br/><br/>Standing in the square of the teleportation array, tianci looked at his surroundings with a shocked expression.<br/><br/>“The Black Earth tribe is called the first tribe. It gives people a sense of shock. ”<br/><br/>Mu Li Yin’er’s eyes flickered as she scanned her surroundings. There was a hint of surprise on her face.<br/><br/>Mu Li Yin’er’s knowledge was not much more than Tianci’s.<br/><br/>It was also her first time coming to the Black Earth tribe!<br/><br/>“The Black Earth tribe is extremely powerful. Look at the birds and beasts flying in the sky. They are powerful elemental beasts. The Black Earth tribe has raised several powerful elemental beast races. The Black Earth Tribe’s Earth<br/><br/>Dragon Army is the strongest ground combat army in our six paths universe.<br/><br/>They are undefeatable. ”<br/><br/>Mu Li Yin’er’s father introduced tianci with a smile on his face.<br/><br/>Tianci was now considered a treasure of the Mu Li tribe. As his grandfather, he had no objections to Tianci’s birth.<br/><br/>He even had a feeling that it was a blessing in disguise!<br/><br/>Tianci heard it and nodded. He looked around curiously.<br/><br/>There were many strong disciples from various races around.<br/><br/>Mu Li tribe’s strength was not bad, but there was still a huge gap between them and the top tribes.<br/><br/>This time, it was not only the tribes from the six treasured lands that had arrived, the tribes from the outer areas had also arrived.<br/><br/>However, compared to the tribes from the six treasured lands, the other tribes were much weaker.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. This time, during the six paths meet, the Black Earth tribe has prepared a place for all the tribes to live. We’ll go over first. ”<br/><br/>At the front, an elder of the Mu Li tribe swept his gaze across everyone and said!<br/><br/>Following that, the group of people followed the elder and flew towards a certain area of the Earth City.<br/><br/>The entire Earth city was incomparably huge. Each and every one of the buildings that were made of earth emitted a thick and heavy aura.<br/><br/>Within some of the buildings, there were even powerful battle fortresses. At a glance, it was obvious that they were not simple!<br/><br/>They flew all the way inside.<br/><br/>Soon, in the center, there was a basin.<br/><br/>It was an incomparably huge basin.<br/><br/>In the center of the basin, there was an incomparably huge arena.<br/><br/>Around the arena, there were small-scale arenas.<br/><br/>And around these basins, there were numerous earth caves.<br/><br/>The earth caves were densely packed, and there were people entering and leaving.<br/><br/>“This time, the six paths competition will be held here. Around this basin is an underground palace. ”<br/><br/>“We live in many Earth Caves.”<br/><br/>The elder of the Mu Li tribe spoke.<br/><br/>At this moment, an expert of the Black Earth tribe flew over and led them towards an Earth Cave!<br/><br/>Although it was an earth cave, it looked extremely majestic.<br/><br/>The Earth Cave that was emitting a heavy aura and an earthen yellow luster gave off a luxurious feeling.<br/><br/>Entering the interior of the Earth Cave, it was extremely luxurious and had a huge living room.<br/><br/>Further in was a luxurious room.<br/><br/>There were over 10,000 rooms in an Earth Cave.<br/><br/>Every room was extremely spacious!<br/><br/>“Everyone from the Mu Li tribe, you will be staying here for the rest of your time. This is the center of our Earth City and also the safest place. In our Earth City, it is forbidden to have any internal strife, especially fighting<br/><br/>“Once there is a fight, it has nothing to do with right or wrong. Just kill them. If there is a grudge, you can go to the arena to settle it. In the arena, you can not care about life or death! ”<br/><br/>The Black Earth tribe expert reminded everyone from the Mu Li tribe.<br/><br/>“Alright, thank you, Little Brother.”<br/><br/>The Mu Li tribe elder smiled and nodded.<br/><br/>In Earth City, they naturally did not dare to be presumptuous.<br/><br/>After all, the Black Earth tribe had a heavenly Yuan creation stage powerhouse. “En, not far from the six paths arena, there is a street where you can trade any item and have some fun and entertainment. Currently, the six paths competition will only begin in a hundred years. Everyone can take a stroll around. ”<br/><br/>The middle-aged powerhouse of the Black Earth tribe continued to speak with a smile!<br/><br/>The elders of the Mu Li tribe nodded.<br/><br/>“Everyone, find a room. You can take a stroll around the area. Remember, don’t cause any trouble here. ”<br/><br/>After the people from the Xuan Tu tribe left, the elders of the Mu Li tribe spoke to everyone.<br/><br/>“Foster father, mother, we’ll go out to play later.”<br/><br/>Tianci immediately said excitedly to Wang Xian and Mu Li Yin C er.<br/><br/>It was Tianci’s first time going on a long journey and he was very excited.<br/><br/>“No Problem! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head while Mu Liyin’er smiled and replied.<br/><br/>Soon, the few of them walked out of the cave and flew out.<br/><br/>“There are so many people and it’s so lively! ”<br/><br/>Along with Wang Xian and the rest of the people from the Mu Li tribe, they were strolling around.<br/><br/>Wang Xian scanned his surroundings.<br/><br/>There were quite a number of strong practitioners in the Earth City. Wang Xian sensed quietly but did not sense the aura of the strong practitioners of the Heaven ‘s origin.<br/><br/>The strong practitioners of the Heaven’s origin in other universes should not dare to come here<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself.<br/><br/>After all, this was the Earth City, the main city of a tribe of strong practitioners of the Heaven’s origin.<br/><br/>Moreover, after the six paths competition started, it was very likely that the strong practitioners of the Heaven’s origin would descend.<br/><br/>This place could be said to be extremely dangerous for them.<br/><br/>Moreover, the Black Earth tribe should have made some preparations for the Heavenly Yuan creation realm experts.<br/><br/>Although the Heavenly Yuan creation realm experts were very strong, in the six paths universe, ten or so peak universe masters were enough to kill one heavenly Yuan creation realm expert.<br/><br/>After all, the Heavenly Yuan creation realm experts would be suppressed here.<br/><br/>Of course, the Heaven’s origin creator had a trump card. The possibility of killing him was too small.<br/><br/>Wang Xian had the supreme treasure in his body that was bestowed by Heaven to conceal himself. Unless the Heaven’s origin creator was a few hundred meters away from him, he wouldn’t be discovered.<br/><br/>Following that, everyone started to stroll around Earth City!<br/><br/>There were more and more powerful disciples in Earth City. The powerful disciples from various tribes also came one by one.<br/><br/>Wang Xian strolled around with Tian Ci, Mu Li Yin c er, and the rest every day. He was very relaxed.<br/><br/>“Dong Dong Dong! ”<br/><br/>One day a hundred years later, an earthquake-like roar sounded from the arena of the six paths competition.<br/><br/>“Tian Ci, it’s about to start. Let’s hurry over! ”<br/><br/>As the voice sounded, Mu Li Yin’ er’s voice came from outside.<br/><br/>“They’re here, they’re here! ”<br/><br/>Tian Ci came out of the room and the group immediately headed outside!<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, many powerful disciples walked out of the huge pit.<br/><br/>There were also many powerful disciples flying over from the surrounding area.<br/><br/>The six paths competition had begun!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
