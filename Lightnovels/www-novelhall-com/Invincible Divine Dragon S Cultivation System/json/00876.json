According to some witnesses, the experts of the Phoenix Clan said that more than a dozen disciples of our Dragon Palace snatched their treasures. Now, I have asked an lie to resurrect them. However, we will need some time to find out the details! ” Prime Minister Gui replied!<br/><br/>“Alright then. Resurrect those members as soon as possible and ask them about the details. If it is the responsibility of our Dragon Palace, we will bear it ourselves. However, if the Phoenix clan is looking for trouble?”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, he narrowed his eyes slightly. “Then send the charming dragon seed to attack the members of the Phoenix clan directly. We will deal with it secretly first. After I return, we will decide what to do next. ”<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui replied immediately!<br/><br/>“Xiao Xian, What’s Wrong?”<br/><br/>Lan Qingyue asked from the side!<br/><br/>“More than a dozen disciples of the Dragon Palace were killed by the Phoenix clan in public. The specific situation is still unknown. If the Phoenix clan is looking for trouble, Hehe, then we will exterminate all the strong disciples and affiliated races in the starry universe this time! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said with a grim expression!<br/><br/>He was a reasonable person, and the Dragon Palace was also a reasonable force!<br/><br/>If the disciples of the Dragon Palace were to snatch their treasures maliciously, then the Dragon Palace would bear the responsibility!<br/><br/>However, if the Phoenix clan were to provoke them, then let’s start a war!<br/><br/>He had been silent for tens of millions of years. Did he really think that they would catch up to him?<br/><br/>“The Phoenix Clan?”<br/><br/>Lan qingyue nodded her head heavily. “The relationship between the Divine Dragon Clan and the Phoenix clan used to be pretty good. I didn’t expect them to do such a thing after the fall of the Peak Divine Dragon Clan! ”<br/><br/>“I don’t know! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head. “But now, if anyone dares to provoke us, we will definitely make them pay a terrible price. Let’s Go and destroy the gods of this universe first! ”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, he continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>In this area, it was entirely dependent on luck if one wanted to meet the gods of the universe.<br/><br/>However, this area was limited after all. There was still a high possibility of encountering them.<br/><br/>It could be tomorrow, or it could be a year later!<br/><br/>Some things depended on luck!<br/><br/>Just as Wang Xian was continuing to search for the gods of the universe, he was in the communication stone plate in the nine-origin universe. It was located in the huge city in the starry sky. This matter had caused a huge sensation.<br/><br/>However, when the various forces were discussing this matter, they were extremely astonished.<br/><br/>This was because the dragon palace did not have any reaction at the moment.<br/><br/>They did not make any statement.<br/><br/>It was as if nothing had happened!<br/><br/>This made all the powerful disciples from the peak races and other high-level races extremely astonished.<br/><br/>This was not in line with the way the Dragon Palace did things!<br/><br/>Two days had passed, but there was still no response from the Dragon Palace, as if it had never happened!<br/><br/>“What? “It’s strange that there is no response from the Dragon Palace, but maybe this is normal. After all, the Phoenix clan is no longer the Phoenix clan that has just entered the universe. The Dragon King and the others are at most at the level 9 realm. We can fight them, but the Dragon Palace is far inferior to the other experts! ”<br/><br/>“If war breaks out again, the Dragon Palace will definitely be crushed by us. It’s the best choice for them to lower their heads and keep quiet now! ”<br/><br/>At the same time, a few level 7 rulers of the Phoenix clan were laughing and talking in a corner of the starry city.<br/><br/>“But we can’t just let it go like this. The deacons have orders. ”<br/><br/>“We don’t know when the army of the belief universe will attack. Let’s not kill the disciples of the Dragon Palace for now. Let’s make some public comments first!<br/><br/>A Phoenix at the seventh level of the ruler realm said.<br/><br/>The other phoenixes nodded!<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace didn’t say anything because they know that they can’t afford to offend us now. At that time, the Dragon King had the advantage, which was why the Dragon Palace dared to be so arrogant to us. Now that the Dragon Palace has caught up with us in terms of peak combat strength, what does the Dragon Palace mean to us now?”<br/><br/>“So what if the Phoenix clan killed more than a dozen experts of the Dragon<br/><br/>Palace? Did they really think that we were afraid of the Dragon Palace and the Dragon King Last Time?”<br/><br/>“The Phoenix clan killed more than a dozen disciples of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Does the Dragon Palace dare to Fart?”<br/><br/>All of a sudden, a lot of such news appeared on the communication stone plate.<br/><br/>As soon as this news came out, it immediately caused a great shock!<br/><br/>“What? No Way, the Phoenix clan is so fierce? Aren’t they afraid of the Dragon King’s Revenge?”<br/><br/>“This seems to be what the experts of the Phoenix clan said. One of the accounts is indeed from the Phoenix Clan! ”<br/><br/>“It’s definitely from the Phoenix clan. Otherwise, who would dare to pretend to be an expert of the Phoenix Clan?”<br/><br/>All the experts and disciples who saw the news on the communication stone plate discussed in shock.<br/><br/>“Oh? Interesting. ”<br/><br/>The experts and disciples of the Angel clan smiled when they saw the news on the communication stone plate.<br/><br/>They immediately sent some messages on the communication stone plate!<br/><br/>“Although the Dragon Palace was relatively powerful in the past, it relied on the ancient god of the Dragon Palace to feed the Kun master. If the ancient God didn’t feed the Kun master, would our Angel Clan be afraid of them? “But now, tens of millions of years have passed. With the foundation of Our Angel Race and the Phoenix race, we are no weaker than the ancient god Kun master. We are not afraid at all<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace, other than the ancient god Kun master, is trash, especially the ruler-level experts. They can’t be compared to other peak races. Also, the Dragon Palace didn’t participate in the counterattack against the belief universe or the establishment of the nine-origin universe battle team.<br/><br/>First, the Dragon Palace is relatively weak, and second, they are indeed trash<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace has not participated in the war between our nine-essences universe and the belief universe.. What kind of peak race is this Dragon Palace?\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
