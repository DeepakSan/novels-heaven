Crack<br/><br/>Terrifying cracks appeared on the entire powerful Void Pagoda in an instant.<br/><br/>After all, Xining Kung’s void pagoda had not reached the level of the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan.<br/><br/>Although it was powerful, it could not withstand the full-force attack of an expert at the level of Wang Xian’s Great Dao.<br/><br/>“Not good!”<br/><br/>“The strength of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is too terrifying!”<br/><br/>Duke Xining was located in the Void Pagoda. When the terrifying energy entered it, his expression changed drastically. His body suffered a huge impact!<br/><br/>“Pu!”<br/><br/>He spat out a mouthful of blood. With a move, he flew out of the Void Pagoda.<br/><br/>Crack! Crack! Crack<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian’s dragon tail engulfed the entire void pagoda.<br/><br/>The gigantic void pagoda began to change its shape and collapse completely under the influence of his dragon tail!<br/><br/>Wang Xian swung his dragon tail and the Void Pagoda flew into the distance.<br/><br/>“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is very powerful. I can’t defend against him at all!”<br/><br/>Lord Xining was shocked and shouted loudly!<br/><br/>They had underestimated the Dragon King’s strength.<br/><br/>They had underestimated the Dragon Palace’s strength.<br/><br/>With their strength, not to mention holding on for 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Even if they held on for 2 minutes, they wouldn’t be able to do it.<br/><br/>The difference was too big!<br/><br/>They could only escape immediately!<br/><br/>“The king wants us to hold on for 5 minutes, use our trump cards!”<br/><br/>Another void universe country protector shouted with an ugly expression!<br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/>Duke Xining growled and waved his arm. Feeling a little heartache, he threw out one round ball after another.<br/><br/>The round balls attacked Wang Xian directly.<br/><br/>Wang Xian focused his gaze and sensed that the round balls contained a terrifying energy.<br/><br/>His body trembled and countless wind and thunder powers charged forward!<br/><br/>The wind and thunder powers covered the entire void in an instant.<br/><br/>It enveloped Duke Xining and the rest.<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>Under the attack of the wind and thunder powers, the balls exploded.<br/><br/>Each explosion created a terrifying mushroom cloud!<br/><br/>However, this terrifying mushroom cloud was completely blocked by Wang Xian’s wind and thunder powers.<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>Although Wang Xian managed to block the attacks, he was still a little shocked by the attacks of the balls.<br/><br/>The destructive power of these balls was comparable to that of two powerhouses at the control level.<br/><br/>This was not something that Duke Xining could unleash!<br/><br/>It looked like a technological item!<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>At this moment, he looked at Duke Xining with a cold expression in his eyes!<br/><br/>“Netherworld Dragon’s pursuit!”<br/><br/>He waved his arm and sent a Dragon Claw towards Duke Xining!<br/><br/>At the same time, his body disappeared instantly!<br/><br/>When Duke Xining saw Wang Xian’s dragon claw attack, his expression changed drastically.<br/><br/>With his strength, he could not withstand any of Wang Xian’s attacks. He could only Dodge.<br/><br/>His body moved and he immediately teleported!<br/><br/>Buzz Buzz<br/><br/>Buzz Buzz<br/><br/>The moment he teleported, Wang Xian’s figure appeared beside him!<br/><br/>A Dragon Claw was clawing at him.<br/><br/>Duke Xining’s expression changed drastically as he revealed a terrified expression.<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>The Dragon Claw landed on his body, causing him to be unable to dodge in time!<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>His body collapsed immediately.<br/><br/>However, in the next moment, his body started to distort and the surrounding space started to distort as well.<br/><br/>His entire body appeared beside him in an instant.<br/><br/>“Huff! Huff!”<br/><br/>“Huff! Huff!”<br/><br/>He panted heavily and his face was filled with fear.<br/><br/>This time, it was a powerful treasure that he had obtained that allowed him to dodge a fatal blow in an instant!<br/><br/>“Soaring Cloud Dragon!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw that he had dodged his fatal blow, his expression did not change at all.<br/><br/>As an expert at the control level, it was normal for him to have such a treasure!<br/><br/>Wang Yun opened his dragon mouth and a cloud of mist shot out!<br/><br/>It instantly enveloped the entire space!<br/><br/>“Duke Jin Ming, I can’t hold on any longer. If this continues, I’ll be killed. The treasure in my hand will only allow me to hold on for two minutes at most!”<br/><br/>Duke Xi Ning saw the surrounding cloud of mist appear.<br/><br/>His vision was blocked by a huge barrier and he roared with an extremely ugly expression!<br/><br/>“I’m no match for them either. Their strength is comparable to two ordinary control-level experts!”<br/><br/>Duke Jin Ming’s expression also changed drastically as he replied loudly!<br/><br/>He was now facing the Void Dragon Body and Lin Niu, Lan Qingyue, and the others, and was completely no match for them!<br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/>Duke Xining’s heart sank.<br/><br/>This time, he was prepared to make use of the spatial attribute’s characteristic to dodge the Dragon King’s attack while killing some of the Dragon Palace’s disciples!<br/><br/>However, he didn’t expect this situation!<br/><br/>He couldn’t retaliate at all!<br/><br/>His breathing was rapid, and his body was trembling!<br/><br/>“Roar Roar!”<br/><br/>At this time, a dragon’s roar entered his mind, making his head feel like it was about to explode!<br/><br/>He gritted his teeth and teleported to the back!<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>But at this time, a dragon’s tail appeared at the position where he teleported.<br/><br/>It swept towards his body!<br/><br/>It was another fatal attack!<br/><br/>With this attack, Duke Xining felt that he only had a sliver of life left!<br/><br/>He moved his palm, and a dancing fruit was directly thrown into his mouth!<br/><br/>In an instant, the injuries on his body recovered!<br/><br/>“Run, I Can’t face it head-on, I’ll Fight!”<br/><br/>Duke Xining gritted his teeth, and his body began to flicker continuously!<br/><br/>“Peng!”<br/><br/>However, when he blinked twice, he felt an invisible barrier blocking his path.<br/><br/>This made his expression change. With a move of his palm, a dagger appeared in his hand and attacked the barrier!<br/><br/>“Boom!”<br/><br/>Just as he was attacking forward with the dagger in his hand, a fatal attack descended once again!<br/><br/>“Spatial substitute!”<br/><br/>Duke Xining bit down and roared in pain!<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s attack landed on his body, dissipating his life force rapidly.<br/><br/>However, Duke Xining’s body appeared in the distance again. He held the dagger in his hand and landed heavily in the void in front of him.<br/><br/>The dagger seemed to be able to cut through the void of the universe, directly creating a huge crack.<br/><br/>He hurriedly jumped into the crack!<br/><br/>“Can I escape?”<br/><br/>With a move of his palm, a branch appeared and instantly coiled around Duke Xining’s body.<br/><br/>This was the branch that was the most precious treasure of the Heaven’s origin.<br/><br/>Wang Xian had taken a few of the branches that were the most precious treasure of the Heaven’s origin. After the nurturing of the ancestral tree, they also possessed terrifying strength.<br/><br/>“It’s over!”<br/><br/>The branches wrapped around Duke Xining’s body, causing a hint of despair to appear on his face.<br/><br/>The life-saving treasures in his hands had already been used up.<br/><br/>This time around, he had brought three life-saving treasures with him.<br/><br/>In his opinion, this was sufficient.<br/><br/>If he were to really encounter danger, three was not enough. Perhaps four or five would not be enough.<br/><br/>Therefore, under normal circumstances, he would only bring three life-saving treasures with him.<br/><br/>The rest would stay.<br/><br/>He could not bring all of his trump cards with him. Otherwise, once he died, he would not be able to bear the loss.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
