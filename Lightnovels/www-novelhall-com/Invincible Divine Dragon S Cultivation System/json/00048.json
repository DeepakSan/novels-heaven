We, nine swords, are doing our job. It’s best that we don’t interfere!”<br/><br/>A cold voice was heard.<br/><br/>In the air, the group of people chasing after the Asian dragon saw Wang Xian’s figure. Their pupils contracted slightly and they immediately warned him loudly.<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>“Save me!”<br/><br/>The Asian dragon with a head like a deer shouted at Wang Xian with a face full of fear.<br/><br/>The human in front of him was his last hope.<br/><br/>She wasn’t sure if he was a good person or a bad person.<br/><br/>Should she be captured as well.<br/><br/>“Nine swords?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian heard the cry from the other side and heard the pleading of the Asian Dragon. He frowned slightly.<br/><br/>“Come here!”<br/><br/>He waved his arm and a surge of energy pulled the Asian Dragon, causing it to speed up abruptly.<br/><br/>The Yalong who was pulled over was slightly shocked. He looked at Wang Xian timidly.<br/><br/>“You’re courting death. Hand over that Molong deer to us immediately. Otherwise, don’t blame us for being impolite.”<br/><br/>Upon seeing Wang Xian interfering, the expressions of the thirty over people from nine swords changed slightly. The old man in the lead shouted sternly.<br/><br/>“She belongs to me now.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze across the group and said faintly.<br/><br/>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”<br/><br/>When the group of 35 heard his words, their expressions changed slightly. They looked at each other and immediately surrounded Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Brother, we are the disciples of the nine swords race of the Milky Way. We have been hunting this mollusk for a long time. If you interfere, you will be making an enemy out of the nine swords race of the Milky Way.”<br/><br/>“You have to consider it carefully. Is it worth it for a mollusk?”<br/><br/>The old man in the lead frowned and said to Wang Xian with a gloomy face.<br/><br/>“Save me. They want to capture me as a mount and war pet. Save Me.”<br/><br/>While the old man was speaking, the mollusc deer at the side pleaded.<br/><br/>“In the universe, demons are considered intelligent beings. She is not a desolate beast. It is not good for you to capture her directly!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the mollusk deer beside him and frowned as he spoke to the people from the nine swords race.<br/><br/>“In that case, are you going to be our enemy?”<br/><br/>Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, the eyes of the thirty-five people from the nine swords race turned cold. They held the longswords in their hands tightly and were filled with awe.<br/><br/>“Is this the current situation with the Divine Dragon Bloodline?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled as his gaze swept across the thirty-odd people.<br/><br/>“Attack!”<br/><br/>At this moment, the 30-odd people on the opposite side did not hesitate. They moved and attacked Wang Xian directly.<br/><br/>Out of the 35 people, five of them were at the eighth level of the divine emperor.<br/><br/>“Die!”<br/><br/>“Dragon Eyes Lock All Corners!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw them attacking, his eyes were filled with killing intent.<br/><br/>Hualala<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>Laws and supernatural powers were unleashed instantly. The entire world changed.<br/><br/>Dragon Shadows pulled on the chains and appeared around them instantly, sealing them off instantly.<br/><br/>“What!”<br/><br/>“Not good. He is very strong. We are not his match!”<br/><br/>“Run!”<br/><br/>The faces of the thirty-five people changed drastically when they sensed the terrifying strength that Wang Xian unleashed instantly.<br/><br/>They wanted to escape.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian would not let them escape. Once they escaped, they might be in trouble.<br/><br/>“Die!”<br/><br/>“No, no, no!”<br/><br/>“Stop! If you kill us, we nine swords will not let you off!”<br/><br/>A terrified voice rang out. Wang Xian’s eyes did not have the slightest fluctuation.<br/><br/>Chains penetrated their bodies in an instant. Under his laws and Abhijna, the thirty-five people could not resist at all.<br/><br/>Even they were very strong.<br/><br/>“What is this?”<br/><br/>When the mollusk saw Wang Xian’s attack, he widened his eyes and revealed a hint of shock.<br/><br/>“Hualala!”<br/><br/>The dragon eye chains dragged over the corpses one by one. Wang Xian waved his arm and placed the corpses into the Dragon Palace of the Divine Kingdom.<br/><br/>These corpses could be turned into resources for the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“You… you have the bloodline of the Divine Dragon?”<br/><br/>At the side, the mollusk widened its eyes and stared at Wang Xian in disbelief. It asked in shock.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at her and his aura trembled slightly. A wave of dragon’s might enveloped her.<br/><br/>Bang<br/><br/>Sensing this wave of dragon’s might, the mollusk’s body trembled. It laid down in the air and trembled slightly.<br/><br/>However, her eyes were filled with excitement.<br/><br/>What a pure aura of the dragon. What a powerful aura of the Divine Dragon.<br/><br/>“Are all the inferior dragons so miserable now?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the injuries on his body. With a wave of his arm, drops of life force liquid landed on her body.<br/><br/>The injuries on her body healed at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>“Thank you, thank you, sir.”<br/><br/>The mollusk deer thanked Wang Xian with a face full of gratitude.<br/><br/>“Bang!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his hand and crushed the confinement ring above her head. He sized her up and said, “The Divine Dragon bloodline in your body is very thin!”<br/><br/>“Sir, our mollusk deer clan doesn’t belong to the Divine Dragon Bloodline. Under normal circumstances, we aren’t even ranked as a sub-dragon. However… I accidentally regressed my bloodline and obtained a trace of the Divine Dragon Bloodline.”<br/><br/>“After my godly dragon bloodline was discovered, there were humans who immediately tried to capture me. They even killed my parents and the rest of the race.”<br/><br/>The mollusk’s eyes were filled with tears as he said sadly.<br/><br/>“My lord, I can sense the godly dragon bloodline from your body. You have to be careful too. They are very powerful!”<br/><br/>“The nine sword race that are chasing after them. They are a primary race in the universe and have a powerful existence with a universe knight.”<br/><br/>The mollusk continued to speak to him.<br/><br/>“HMM, if you don’t have any clansmen, follow me.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to her.<br/><br/>“Thank you, sir. Thank you, benefactor!”<br/><br/>The mollusk hesitated for a moment before replying immediately.<br/><br/>The next moment, her body moved slightly and transformed into a human form. There was a pair of antlers on her head.<br/><br/>She was about 1.6 meters tall and looked soft and weak. Her eyes were red.<br/><br/>“Don’t you know how to hide the power of your bloodline? That’s right. If you know how to hide, you won’t be hunted down.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at her and asked with a smile on his face. Then, he shook his head and pointed with his finger. A Ray of light entered her mind.<br/><br/>“This is a method to hide your bloodline. Unless you fight in your original form, you won’t be able to sense your Yalong bloodline.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said to her.<br/><br/>“Thank you, thank you, my Lord!”<br/><br/>Mo Long Lu lowered his head and thanked him again.<br/><br/>“Alright, no need to thank me. You have the Divine Dragon Bloodline. We can be considered a family. What’s Your Name?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his hand at her. He flapped his incipient saint wings and a wave of energy enveloped her as she continued to fly forward.<br/><br/>“Benefactor, my name is Mo Xin Lu.”<br/><br/>Sensing the speed of her surroundings, Mi Xin Lu widened her eyes slightly and said hurriedly.<br/><br/>“Are there many Yalong in the Milky Way? Are they all in such a miserable state?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued to ask her.<br/><br/>He had just arrived at the Milky Way when he encountered a Yalong who was being hunted down. This caused Wang Xian to frown slightly.<br/><br/>Mi Xin Lu was already an intelligent creature in the universe. She was not a dire beast.<br/><br/>However, even so, she was still being pursued without restraint. The Asian Dragon, who had the bloodline of the Divine Dragon, seemed to be having a hard time.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
