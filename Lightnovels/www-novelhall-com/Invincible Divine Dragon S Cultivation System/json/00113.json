Is it at the level of an acquired Numinous Treasure? The experts of the nine-sword race have no power to resist at all.”<br/><br/>“Hiss, it’s too powerful. So what if they are experts of the nine-sword race? They will have to pay the price for killing our junior brother Miao!”<br/><br/>In the crescent mystic realm, the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect were all excited and excited when they saw the experts of the nine-sword race on the ground who were easily killed by them.<br/><br/>It was effortless!<br/><br/>“What kind of acquired Numinous Treasure is that? How can it be so powerful?”<br/><br/>“Divine weapons and treasures are not suppressed in the mystic Luna realm. That acquired Numinous Treasure of his can match the attack power of three or four peak divine emperor experts outside.”<br/><br/>“That treasure can instantly suppress a battle angel. It should be able to match four or five peak divine emperor experts.”<br/><br/>At the side, senior brother Lu, senior brother Kong, and the rest transmitted their voice with faces full of shock.<br/><br/>That treasure was simply a great killing tool in this place.<br/><br/>“Thank you, junior brother Wang Xian, for helping us to avenge junior brother Miao!”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Junzi walked towards Wang Xian and cupped his hands in gratitude.<br/><br/>“It’s just a small matter!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head. With a wave of his arm, he grabbed the corpses one by one.<br/><br/>“Fellow martial brothers, we have killed a powerhouse from the nine-sword race. You should know the severity of this matter. You must not tell anyone about this. This concerns the safety of all of us. Do you understand?”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Junzi turned around and looked at all the disciples of the Willow Deity sect.<br/><br/>“Senior Brother Junzi, we know in our hearts that after we return this time, I will enter seclusion for a few thousand years.”<br/><br/>“Yes, yes, we will stay at the Willow deity Daoist sect for a few thousand years. hahaha!”<br/><br/>The group of Senior Brothers and sisters from the Willow deity Daoist sect laughed out loud.<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Junzi nodded his head in satisfaction.<br/><br/>“There are quite a number of divine artifacts!”<br/><br/>At the side, Wang Xian was searching through a group of corpses. When he saw the large number of divine artifacts in their interspatial rings, he narrowed his eyes slightly.<br/><br/>These must be the divine artifacts they obtained on the second floor.<br/><br/>With a wave of his arm, over a thousand divine weapons appeared in front of him. The lowest one was a weapon used by a level six divine emperor.<br/><br/>Among them, there were more than a dozen divine weapons at the level of a peak divine emperor.<br/><br/>“This is?”<br/><br/>In the surrounding area, everyone’s pupils contracted slightly when they saw so many divine weapons emitting such a sharp and majestic aura. Their faces were filled with shock.<br/><br/>“So many divine weapons!”<br/><br/>Some female disciples opened their mouths slightly and looked at the dazzling divine weapons with fervent eyes.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the divine weapons in front of him. With a wave of his arm, divine weapons flew towards the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect.<br/><br/>Based on everyone’s strength, each of them had two divine weapons of the same level.<br/><br/>Senior Brother Gentleman Wang Xian only gave one divine weapon. Senior Brother Kong and senior brother Xu also only gave one divine weapon.<br/><br/>Senior brother Lu and the rest, Wang Xian gave one divine weapon at the peak of the celestial thearch level and three divine weapons at the ninth level of the celestial thearch level.<br/><br/>“These are the divine weapons that are given to you. I will take the rest.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian swept his gaze across everyone. Without asking for their consent, he kept the rest.<br/><br/>After that, he kept the corpses.<br/><br/>“Thank you, brother Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>“Thank you, junior brother Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>The disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect looked at the divine weapons floating in front of them with excitement in their eyes.<br/><br/>These divine weapons were of great value to them.<br/><br/>“Thank you, junior brother Wang Xian.”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Junzi was also full of smiles. A divine weapon at the peak of the Celestial Emperor realm was not bad at all.<br/><br/>They were able to kill the people from the nine-sword race and avenge junior brother Miao all because of Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“I have gained more.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled faintly. He glanced at the battle angels around him and said, “Continue to suppress them!”<br/><br/>As he spoke, he waved the five elements millstone in his hand and broke the chests of the battle angels one by one.<br/><br/>“Do it!”<br/><br/>Senior brother Lu and the rest looked at the divine weapons in front of them. After keeping them, they went to suppress the battle angels.<br/><br/>“It’s all thanks to brother Wang Xian this time. Otherwise, we might not have been able to obtain so many treasures by ourselves.”<br/><br/>“That’s true. Even without the people from the nine-sword race, we might be able to obtain a large number of divine weapons. However, once we reach this level, if we were to break through the battle angels at the peak of the Celestial Emperor Realm, all of us would have to die. I’m already satisfied with such a harvest.”<br/><br/>“Hahaha, I am also satisfied. It’s all thanks to brother Wang Xian.”<br/><br/>The group of disciples from the Willow deity Daoist sect chatted happily in the surroundings.<br/><br/>Not far away, senior brother Lu and the rest did not show much emotion on their faces.<br/><br/>Although Wang Xian had given them divine weapons at the peak of the Celestial Emperor realm, compared to Wang Xian’s own gains, these treasures were only one-tenth.<br/><br/>Furthermore, they had to bear the risk of being taken revenge by the nine-sword race.<br/><br/>This harvest was not small, but it was not much either.<br/><br/>Following that, without the interference of the nine-sword race, Wang Xian continued to suppress the battle angels one by one.<br/><br/>After a few minutes, he suppressed thousands of them. After a few minutes, all the battle angels on the third level were suppressed.<br/><br/>In these few minutes, he had once again obtained three battle angels at the peak of the Celestial Emperor Realm.<br/><br/>Now, he had six battle angels at the peak of the celestial thearch.<br/><br/>Senior Brother Lu, senior brother Kong and the rest had obtained five to six hundred battle angels, which could not be compared to Wang Xian at all.<br/><br/>Wang Xian had more than 13,000 battle angels in his hands.<br/><br/>“Two of you!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was in a good mood after obtaining such a harvest. He waved his arm and one battle angel and core flew into the hands of the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect.<br/><br/>Compared to the promise made at the beginning, each of them was given an additional battle Angel.<br/><br/>“Thank you, brother Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>“Thank you, junior brother Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>The disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect were so happy that their mouths were wide open.<br/><br/>This was a battle angel whose strength was comparable to theirs.<br/><br/>Two battle angels of the same level as them. It was simply too exhilarating.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. Let’s go to the fourth level!”<br/><br/>Senior brother Lu and the rest saw that Wang Xian did not give them any battle angels. Their expressions were slightly unpleasant. They looked at the entrance of the fourth level and clenched their fists slightly.<br/><br/>“Okay!”<br/><br/>Senior Brother Junzi nodded and looked at Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. There are dangers on the third level. There might be dangers on the fourth level as well. Be careful.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian reminded them.<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>Senior Junzi and the rest nodded.<br/><br/>Now, they had already regarded Wang Xian as their backbone.<br/><br/>They walked towards the entrance to the fourth floor. Soon, they stood in front of the entrance.<br/><br/>The entrance to the fourth floor was sealed by a door made of a special material. Wang Xian waved his arm and slowly pushed it open.<br/><br/>Crack! Crack! Crack<br/><br/>The door to the entrance slowly opened and an incomparably huge library appeared in sight.<br/><br/>Located in the middle of the library, a one-meter-long treasure that looked like a crescent moon was suspended in the middle of the library. It was emitting a bright glow.<br/><br/>When everyone saw the treasure, their eyes revealed an extremely heated expression.<br/><br/>“That… that is the crescent moon in the sky, the acquired spiritual treasure, the crescent moon in the sky!”<br/><br/>The gentleman stared at the crescent moon could not help but growl.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
