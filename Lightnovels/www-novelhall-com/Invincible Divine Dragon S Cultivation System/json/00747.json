It did not care too much about the attack of this metal. Of course, even if it wanted to dodge, it could not!<br/><br/>However, when the metal landed on his body, a pure ice force and a terrifying collision force directly penetrated his body!<br/><br/>The metal was thousands of meters in size, and a thousand-meter-sized hole appeared on his body!<br/><br/>The terrifying ice force caused the fire Phoenix’s body to tremble violently.<br/><br/>He felt that his body and blood were completely frozen!<br/><br/>His eyes were filled with fear and despair.<br/><br/>“No!”<br/><br/>He shouted crazily as his body trembled violently.<br/><br/>“Die!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian saw that he was severely injured. His body moved and rushed over together with his four netherspirit avatars.<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>The terrifying attack landed on the Fire Phoenix. His life force quickly disappeared.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>At this moment, two space beasts emerged from two life planets not far away.<br/><br/>Their huge bodies looked over and felt a hint of threat!<br/><br/>“Woo Woo!”<br/><br/>The two space beasts did not hesitate and fled into the distance!<br/><br/>“Whoosh! Whoosh!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved his body and quickly kept the corpses of the three fire phoenixes. Then, he flew towards the two space beasts.<br/><br/>The two space beasts were slightly weaker than Wang Xian. They should not have reached the level of the ruler of the universe yet.<br/><br/>“Five elements Millstone, suppress!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements Millstone flew over. The Godly Dragon Shadows flew out and twined around the two space beasts!<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>The two space beasts were entangled by the Godly Dragon Shadows and wanted to break free.<br/><br/>However, under the suppression of the five elements millstone, they could not move at all.<br/><br/>“Perfect!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked over and smiled.<br/><br/>Among the three corpses of the Fire Phoenix, there was also the corpse of a level two universe dominator, the Fire Phoenix.<br/><br/>Just this one corpse was enough to increase the number of disciples at the peak of the Universe Knight Realm in the Dragon Palace by 100.<br/><br/>The other two level one universe Dominators were also enough to increase the number of disciples in the Dragon Palace by 20!<br/><br/>This was a huge harvest.<br/><br/>“Should I kill these two space beasts, or… ?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the two space beasts that he had suppressed and fell into deep thought!<br/><br/>These two space beasts were not very strong.<br/><br/>“Just now, the three Phoenixes said that they wanted to suppress them as Space Beasts’mounts?”<br/><br/>He thought of the words of the three fire phoenixes and fell into deep thought.<br/><br/>After a moment of hesitation, he examined the corpses of the three fire phoenixes.<br/><br/>As he could not sense the divine kingdom, their items could not be placed in the divine kingdom. They could only be placed in spatial treasures.<br/><br/>When he opened the spatial treasures of the three fire phoenixes, a look of pleasant surprise immediately appeared on his face.<br/><br/>“This… there are so many treasures in here. They have plundered at least a few hundred life planets!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian checked their storage space and his face was filled with surprise.<br/><br/>Other than these, there were also a few communication stone disks!<br/><br/>Unlike the AI, communication stone disks could be kept a hundred percent secret.<br/><br/>However, it was still difficult to crack the communication stone disks of the strong!<br/><br/>With a wave of his arm, the demonic ship in the void flew over with some corpses!<br/><br/>Wang Xian searched the corpses and found some treasures as well as some communication stone plates.<br/><br/>He took over a communication stone plate and cracked it. Immediately, he raised his eyebrows.<br/><br/>This communication stone plate was forged by imitating some models of the universe’s AI, but it was more concise!<br/><br/>On the communication stone plate, there were the contact details of the twelve peak races. Usually, the disciples of the nine-origin universe would find treasures, but if it was too dangerous, they could look for the peak races.<br/><br/>The peak races would also give them sufficient rewards!<br/><br/>This was one of the reasons. Secondly, the entire communication stone plate’s chat space contained a large amount of news and information. There were even some strategies!<br/><br/>Among them, there was also a map. There were many places where the map was missing. It was obvious that the experts and disciples of the nine-origin world had drawn it themselves. The reliability of the map was not very high!<br/><br/>Wang Xian checked it and found that there was a lot of information. There were even messages from the strong ones saying that he had obtained a huge opportunity.<br/><br/>“It seems that there are already a lot of strong disciples from the nine-origin universe who have entered this place!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled. Looking at the communication stone plate, his eyes suddenly flashed with a glimmer!<br/><br/>Killing three fire phoenixes at random not only brought him three overlord-level corpses, but also a large number of resources and treasures!<br/><br/>If he could kill dozens of them, he would be able to gather all the resources needed for his breakthrough!<br/><br/>“Why don’t I give it a try? I have a grudge with the angel race and the Phoenix race anyway. It’s not bad to be able to kill some of them!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes sparkled!<br/><br/>With his current strength, as long as he wasn’t an existence above the overlord-level two realm, he could kill them all.<br/><br/>He was confident that he could kill even two or three level two universe masters.<br/><br/>After killing a few, he would continue to search for treasures.<br/><br/>At the thought of this, a smile appeared on his face. He scanned his surroundings and started to collect some resources from the life planets.<br/><br/>After collecting the resources, he stood there and took out a communication stone plate. His eyes were shining.<br/><br/>He hesitated for a moment and found the contact information of the Angel clan. Then, he sent a message directly.<br/><br/>“My Lords of the Angel clan, I have discovered more than a dozen life planets. However, there is danger here. It seems like there are two space beasts!”<br/><br/>After he sent the message, he waited quietly!<br/><br/>“Open the location on your side. Also, can you sense the strength of the Space Beasts?”<br/><br/>Very soon, a message was sent. Wang Xian took a look and no longer isolated the location of the communication stone plate.<br/><br/>“The two space beasts should have the combat strength of a level three universe dominator.”<br/><br/>At the same time, in the communication of the angel race, Wang Xian’s GPS and message were sent to all the powerful disciples of the Angel race.<br/><br/>“Who is near this location? The disciples of the high-level races have reported that there are more than ten life planets here. However, there are two space beasts. The Space Beasts need us to deal with them as a level one universe dominator.”<br/><br/>The message was sent out.<br/><br/>“I’m closer!”<br/><br/>Soon, an angel replied, “I’ll lead my Angel Army. We can easily take care of them!”<br/><br/>“Okay, be careful. If there’s a problem, notify us!”<br/><br/>The Angel Race’s expert who was in charge of receiving the message immediately reminded.<br/><br/>This was a way for the angel race to send messages. Every ruler-level and above angel would head to their respective domains to search for treasures.<br/><br/>Once a disciple from a high-level race asked for their help, the nearest angel would go and accept the mission.<br/><br/>“Wait for me there. I’ll be there in two days!”<br/><br/>Soon, Wang Xian received a message from an angel.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
