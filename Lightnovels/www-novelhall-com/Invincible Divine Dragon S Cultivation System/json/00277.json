Rumble<br/><br/>The battle below was in full swing, the clash between the dragon species, waves of terrifying pressure filled the surroundings.<br/><br/>Dragon Palace Water Dragon Palace Knight and Demon Dragon Fire Dragon Palace Red Gold Battle Dragon Knight clashed.<br/><br/>The clash between the normal dragon species had already begun.<br/><br/>At the Knight level, the Dragon Palace and Water Dragon Palace gradually gained the upper hand.<br/><br/>“The legendary MAD Dragon of the Godly Dragon bloodline, that is the Arrow Dragon, a Pinnacle Dragon. This Dragon Palace actually has a pinnacle dragon, and the other dragon species don’t look weak at all.”<br/><br/>“With so many pinnacle dragon species, they are already comparable to the powerful Dragon Palace when the Godly Dragon was at its peak, what kind of opportunity did this Dragon Palace get!”<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>At the same time, in the Dark World of the Devil Dragon, the Devil Dragon Emperor stared coldly at the area below him with an unusually gloomy expression.<br/><br/>As a powerful Devil Dragon who had obtained the inheritance of the Dragon God, he quickly recognized the berserk dragon species and the arrow dragon species of the Dragon Palace below.<br/><br/>These were peak-tier dragon species that were comparable to pure-tier divine dragons.<br/><br/>In their entire devil dragon lineage, there were only two pure-tier divine dragons. In other words, the Dragon Palace had more than a thousand divine dragons and dragon species that were comparable to them.<br/><br/>This made his eyes burn!<br/><br/>The strange dragon that could perfectly suppress the ghost dragon seemed to be a peak-tier dragon.<br/><br/>The Ghost Dragon was a high-tier dragon. Only a peak-tier dragon could suppress them.<br/><br/>“Damn it, I must destroy the Dragon Palace. I want to see what opportunities they have!”<br/><br/>Devil Dragon Emperor roared, his eyes filled with violent killing intent.<br/><br/>“Roar!”<br/><br/>“Dragon Palace, I didn’t expect you to be so powerful!”<br/><br/>At this moment, Devil Dragon King and Water Dragon King were fighting on the ground. Seeing the situation on the battlefield, he roared angrily.<br/><br/>He raised his head and roared, and a terrifying power of darkness hit Devil Dragon Dark World.<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>The Shadow of the Divine Dragon contained a terrifying power.<br/><br/>The Shadow of the Divine Dragon headed straight for the battlefield.<br/><br/>“Humph!”<br/><br/>The Water Dragon King felt the shadow of the Demon Dragon and snorted. His body shook.<br/><br/>Roar! Roar! Roar<br/><br/>In the Water Dragon Palace behind him, another shadow of the Water God Dragon appeared.<br/><br/>It had terrifying power.<br/><br/>These godly dragon shadows formed by the Dragon Palace all had the combat power of a Level 5 universe knight.<br/><br/>“Battle Dragon, come out!”<br/><br/>“Fire God Dragon, come out!”<br/><br/>“Thunder Dragon, come out!”<br/><br/>At this time, the Godly Dragon Shadows of the Dragon Palaces of Fire Dragon Palace, Red Gold Battle Dragon Palace, and wind and Thunder Dragon Palace flew out and joined the battle.<br/><br/>“Be careful, they added four universe Knight Level 5 Great Beings.”<br/><br/>Water Dragon Emperor immediately warned loudly.<br/><br/>The four godly dragon silhouettes were enough to put great pressure on the Dragon Palace and Water Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>In an instant, the disadvantaged Devil Dragon Clan started to fight back.<br/><br/>The Great Beings of Dragon Palace looked over and frowned, trying their best to fight back.<br/><br/>“How is this possible! How is this possible!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a terrified voice came from the side.<br/><br/>At this moment, the huge lotus flower of light blossomed with sacred petals of light.<br/><br/>Each petal covered the remaining 1,000 or so universe knights of the Holy Prose clan.<br/><br/>The 1,000 or so people let out a sigh of relief under the protection of the petals of light.<br/><br/>This light sacred Lotus was the true treasure of their holy prose clan, a pre-sky true treasure.<br/><br/>Once the Light Sacred Lotus’defense was activated, with the power of the holy prose clan’s elders, no level 6 universe knight could break through the defense.<br/><br/>Over 1,000 people returned to the light sacred lotus, their faces showing signs of survival.<br/><br/>It was too terrifying!<br/><br/>They had no way of resisting at all. Even if a level 5 universe knight could withstand one or two attacks, they couldn’t withstand more than a dozen attacks.<br/><br/>That strange speed and the ability to appear and disappear made them panic!<br/><br/>They felt relieved when they returned to the Holy Light Lotus.<br/><br/>Everyone in the holy prose clan looked extremely embarrassed. There were about 4,000 universe knights when they first came, but now there were only about 1,000.<br/><br/>More than 3,000 of them had been killed. This time, their holy prose clan had suffered a huge loss!<br/><br/>However, just as everyone thought they could heave a sigh of relief, they heard the Clan Elder’s terrified voice.<br/><br/>Everyone was slightly shocked and immediately looked to the side.<br/><br/>At this moment, the clan elder of the saint prose clan was clutching his neck. His face was filled with panic.<br/><br/>His body was trembling violently. Everyone could sense that there was a terrifying energy within their clan elder’s body that was extinguishing his life force.<br/><br/>“What’s going on? What’s going on?”<br/><br/>At this moment, everyone started to panic.<br/><br/>What was going on?<br/><br/>They had already set up defenses around, how could the elder be attacked.<br/><br/>“Save the Elder!”<br/><br/>The Knights roared in fear, rays of light energy rushing into his body.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, do you think you can hide here and avoid my assassination?”<br/><br/>At this moment, a loud laughter came from the Holy Light Lotus, and everyone felt their scalps go numb!<br/><br/>Pu! Pu! Pu! Pu<br/><br/>In the next moment, they heard a series of piercing sounds.<br/><br/>“How is this possible? How did he get in?”<br/><br/>The terrified voice came from a great being of the holy prose clan. He looked around in disbelief.<br/><br/>However, his eyes couldn’t keep up with an Lie’s speed at all.<br/><br/>An lie had the power of a Level 5 universe knight. He would appear wherever he thought.<br/><br/>When they turned to look, an lie could already think of a few thoughts.<br/><br/>The defense of the Holy Light Lotus was useless to an lie.<br/><br/>It would be troublesome to kill the holy prose clan’s elder, but after activating the Holy Light Lotus’defense, he completely let his guard down.<br/><br/>This gave an lie an opportunity to directly assassinate them.<br/><br/>Now that the Patriarch of the holy prose clan had been killed, everything would be simple.<br/><br/>“Not good, not good. Quickly run, run back to your divine kingdom!”<br/><br/>Seeing that an lie was able to enter the Holy Light Lotus, the venerables of the Holy Prose clan roared in fear with blood-red eyes.<br/><br/>They were now filled with despair.<br/><br/>What kind of existence had their holy prose clan provoked.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, how Dare You Destroy Our Dragon Palace? Trash, Go to Hell!”<br/><br/>An Lie’s maniacal laughter sounded in their ears as his incomparably sharp weapons harvested the lives of all the experts of the holy prose clan.<br/><br/>As the elders of the holy prose clan didn’t have enough time to be saved, their lives became less and less, and they were directly taken away by an Lie’s attack.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
