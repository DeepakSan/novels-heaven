Go</h1><div class=\"entry-content\" id=\"htmlContent\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3611 3,610 three seconds, destroy! Go<br/><br/>Angels, demons, and the Netherworld race!<br/><br/>The powerhouses from the three peak races were all at the pinnacle of the Universe Knight Realm!<br/><br/>They were all exuding a terrifying aura!<br/><br/>This aura was not something that the six races of the Holy Dragon lineage that Wang Xian and the rest had encountered could compare to!<br/><br/>The combination of the dark angels, demons, and the Netherworld race was very strange!<br/><br/>“Keke, we are just here for a stroll. We don’t have any other intentions.”<br/><br/>“That’s right. We are here for a stroll. Let’s Find a good spot so that we can watch the upcoming battle!”<br/><br/>The Angel of Darkness, the demon, and the Netherworld race experts looked at the halberd dragon guard and sensed that Wang Xian and the rest had flown out. Their gazes landed on Wang Xian and the rest as they spoke casually!<br/><br/>“Watching the battle?”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard what they said, he raised his eyebrows slightly!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, they might be experts from the Invincible Zone!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui, who was sitting at the side, swept his gaze across them with a contemplative look on his face!<br/><br/>Under normal circumstances, angels, demons, and Hades would not mix together!<br/><br/>These three peak races were not that close to each other!<br/><br/>It was obviously abnormal for the powerhouses of these three races to come together!<br/><br/>There was only one explanation. They were the powerhouses of the Invincible Zone!<br/><br/>The Invincible Zone was very special. It wasn’t impossible for them to mix with each other!<br/><br/>“This is the territory of our Dragon Palace. It’s not a place for you to watch the battle and wander around!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at them, especially when he swept his gaze across the three darkness angels. He said expressionlessly!<br/><br/>The Darkness Angels were also an angel race. Although they had two kings, they were still on the same side!<br/><br/>After all, there was still an existence above them who was suppressing them!<br/><br/>It was impossible for the two races to have differences!<br/><br/>“Oh? You’re quite bold to reject us?”<br/><br/>A female darkness angel in the middle stared at Wang Xian. The corners of her mouth curled up slightly as she revealed a bewitching expression. “Interesting. As expected of a top-notch powerhouse in the inner land. I wonder how many moves you can exchange with the Tai Shui Demon King!”<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>“Those are the demons from the Angel Race and the Netherworld race. I think it’s You Cao and the rest!”<br/><br/>“It’s them. They are a little arrogant. They actually entered the domain of the Dragon Palace? The Dragon Palace has more than 50 level 3 universe masters with Combat Strength!”<br/><br/>“Perhaps they are relying on their own strength to think that the Dragon Palace wouldn’t dare to attack them. That’s right. There’s no need for the Dragon Palace to antagonize them. Let’s go. The lords in the clan have said that the Dragon Palace is the last hope of the Divine Dragon Clan. They want us to be on good terms with them!”<br/><br/>In the distance, more than a dozen experts from the Elf clan were floating in the air. They were observing the situation in front of the Dragon Palace. A few of the Elves spoke up!<br/><br/>Their figures moved and they flew towards the Dragon Palace!<br/><br/>“Leave this place!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard the female Angel of Darkness’words, his expression didn’t change at all. He spoke again!<br/><br/>The other party was from the Angel clan. He and the Angel clan were enemies to begin with. How could he give them a good look?<br/><br/>Could it be that he even invited them in?<br/><br/>Just because they were a peak race?<br/><br/>They didn’t exist!<br/><br/>“HMM? What if we don’t leave this place?”<br/><br/>When the demon heard Wang Xian’s words, a teasing look appeared on his face. “This is the Dragon King. He can instantly kill someone of the same level? TSK TSK, he should be much stronger than me!”<br/><br/>“Aksu, you dare to be so arrogant here even if he is stronger than you? Aren’t you afraid that the Dragon Palace will destroy you all?”<br/><br/>As soon as he finished his sentence, more than ten elves flew over.<br/><br/>Among them, some carried bows and arrows on their backs while some held staffs in their hands.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw the more than ten elves, his eyes flickered slightly!<br/><br/>They were slightly different from the elves that he had seen in the Elf clan. The difference was mainly in their temperament!<br/><br/>These more than ten elves were less elegant and calm, but more murderous and cold!<br/><br/>However, the elves still looked at the Dragon Palace with friendly eyes!<br/><br/>“Welcome, Elves!”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui looked at them and cupped his hands to welcome them!<br/><br/>It was easy to tell who was the enemy and who was the friend!<br/><br/>“Oh? Elves, I heard that you are protecting this small force. Without your protection, the Dragon Palace wouldn’t exist anymore!”<br/><br/>An expert from the Angel clan spoke up!<br/><br/>“Hehe, the Dragon Palace still needs our protection?”? “It was your Angel clan who wanted to destroy the Dragon Palace. After that, your lackeys were beaten up by the Dragon Palace. It seems that you guys are here to cause trouble. Do you want us to spar with you guys and send you on Your Way?”<br/><br/>An elf stared at them and spoke indifferently. He swept his gaze across the experts from the dragon palace and added, “Perhaps the dragon palace would be able to destroy you guys even without our help!”<br/><br/>“Oh? Our Dragon Palace can take action?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian heard the experts from the Elf clan saying that they wanted the dragon palace to exterminate them twice. He was slightly curious and asked the experts from the Elf clan!<br/><br/>“Hehe, in the invincible zone, as long as you are not a master of the universe, you can kill as you wish. No matter what race you are from, you can kill as you wish. All the peak races will not say anything. Not only will they not say anything, they will not even care about it. After all, if they continue to care about it, it would be too embarrassing for the peak races.”<br/><br/>“In the outside world, the experts from the invincible zone are not only the top races, but also the invincible zone. In other words, if they were the first to provoke other races, the other races can kill them. The top races won’t Say Anything!”<br/><br/>“On the contrary, experts from the top races like us from the invincible zone can challenge those of the same level. We can’t kill them indiscriminately. As for the experts from the top races in the invincible zone, like the Tai Shui Demon King, there’s no such restriction!”<br/><br/>An Elf explained to Wang Xian!<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard that, he nodded his head slightly!<br/><br/>This did not conflict with the rules between the peak races!<br/><br/>To put it bluntly, the experts from the peak races who entered the invincible zone were considered trash in the eyes of the peak races!<br/><br/>If they did not make a breakthrough after such a long time, wouldn’t they be considered trash?<br/><br/>The peak races did not take these disciples to heart!<br/><br/>“If that’s the case, the five of you, I’ll give you two seconds to get out of the Dragon Palace’s Territory!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke directly to them!<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>The moment he finished his sentence, the Elves were stunned!<br/><br/>The Three Darkness Angels, demons, and Hades were also stunned!<br/><br/>They didn’t expect that Wang Xian had changed so much!<br/><br/>After receiving this news, he didn’t put them in his eyes at all?<br/><br/>This was simply looking down on them!<br/><br/>After being taken aback, a smile appeared on the Elf’s face!<br/><br/>“No wonder our great elven lords value the Dragon Palace so much. This Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is pretty good!”<br/><br/>An elven powerhouse couldn’t help but laugh as he spoke!<br/><br/>They liked Wang Xian’s style of doing things very much!<br/><br/>“Hahaha, arrogant, so arrogant. No wonder the Tai Shui Demon King challenged you. Your Dragon Palace is really arrogant!”<br/><br/>When the demon Aksu heard Wang Xian’s words, a violent killing intent burst out from his eyes!<br/><br/>This terrifying killing intent soared straight to the sky!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
