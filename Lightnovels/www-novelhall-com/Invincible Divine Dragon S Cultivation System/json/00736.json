His expression changed and he immediately looked over.<br/><br/>Their eyes met.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the 12-winged angel.<br/><br/>The extremely handsome and extraordinary 12-winged angel stood there and stared at him with a calm expression.<br/><br/>A long white robe was draped over his body and there were three words carved on it!<br/><br/>“The third Prince of the Radiant Angel of the Angel clan.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked over and his pupils contracted slightly.<br/><br/>The third Prince looked at him quietly and looked at his side.<br/><br/>“Monitor all the members of the Dragon Palace. The moment anyone with the Divine Dragon bloodline enters, lock down the Dragon Palace immediately and kill them. I don’t want any of the disciples of the Dragon Palace to be alive after entering the starry universe.”<br/><br/>He looked at a burly battle angel beside him and ordered.<br/><br/>“It’s Your Highness, the third prince. Leave one of the Dragon Kings to me.”<br/><br/>The burly 12-winged angel nodded and looked at Wang Xian as well.<br/><br/>“The third Prince’s strength is extremely terrifying. It’s so terrifying that he can kill me in an instant.”<br/><br/>“That burly Angel’s strength is equally terrifying. He can also kill me easily.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood there and his expression changed slightly.<br/><br/>Wang Xian estimated that the third prince’s strength was at least at the fifth level of the universe dominator.<br/><br/>It was even possible for him to reach the seventh or eighth level of the universe dominator, or even higher.<br/><br/>The angel who was staring at him now was also very powerful.<br/><br/>“As expected, the third prince still wants to kill me. I reckon that once I enter, the experts of the angel race will come and kill me!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian frowned slightly, and a contemplative look appeared on his face.<br/><br/>The angel race could not attack him here, but they could do so in the starry universe.<br/><br/>The Starry Universe was an unknown Treasure Trove. Although there were dangers, it could allow an expert to soar into the sky.<br/><br/>According to the thinking of an expert, the third Prince would definitely not allow the experts of the Dragon Palace to search for opportunities in the starry universe.<br/><br/>It was highly possible that he would allow them to enter and then destroy them.<br/><br/>“If I enter now, I can still escape from their lock.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian pondered in his heart. With the escape scroll in his hand, he could escape in an instant.<br/><br/>Although this instant escape was somewhat random, it was still a life-saving treasure and could be used three times.<br/><br/>He could use the mother nest to lead the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace into it and escape.<br/><br/>“Let’s Go!”<br/><br/>He was deep in thought. With a move of his body, he disappeared instantly.<br/><br/>“Third prince, take this to prevent those with the divine dragon bloodline from being taken away from the life space.”<br/><br/>After Wang Xian disappeared, the eyes of the Green River Phoenix landed on the third prince from the side of the Angel clan.<br/><br/>In front of the third prince, a statue with the head of a dragon appeared.<br/><br/>Upon seeing this statue, the third prince smiled and nodded his head lightly.<br/><br/>This was to prevent other strong disciples from using their life space to carry the strong disciples of the Dragon Palace away.<br/><br/>Once there was one, the third prince could sense it through the head of the dragon. At that time, he could send people directly or follow them personally.<br/><br/>“A small Dragon Palace wants to fight with me?”<br/><br/>The third prince sneered and revealed a cold expression.<br/><br/>Once he could make a move personally, the small dragon palace would be easily crushed!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian returned to the Dragon Palace and entered the Dragon King’s Hall. He was deep in thought!<br/><br/>“An lie!”<br/><br/>His mind moved and he shouted. However, he didn’t get a response. He then sensed the dragon palace and took out the universal AI to send a message to an lie.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, you called for me!”<br/><br/>Very soon, an Lie’s figure appeared. At this moment, he seemed to be in high spirits.<br/><br/>“Eh?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian sized up an lie, and a look of surprise appeared in his eyes. “An lie, your strength has become stronger?”<br/><br/>“Yes, Dragon King. Dragon King, in the Void Pagoda, I can cultivate. Moreover, the Void Pagoda in the invincible zone is one of the top void pagodas. There aren’t many in the entire void universe. After some research, I discovered other functions that allowed my strength to soar!”<br/><br/>An lie said excitedly.<br/><br/>The Void Pagoda in the Invincible Zone was definitely a top-tier supreme treasure in the Void Universe.<br/><br/>More importantly, this supreme treasure wasn’t an ordinary innate supreme treasure, but a terrifying war machine.<br/><br/>There weren’t many of them in the entire void universe.<br/><br/>Such a powerful supreme treasure was now occupied by an lie alone, and the energy in it greatly increased his strength.<br/><br/>“Oh, is that so? An Lie, how far are you teleporting now?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes lit up as he asked him expectantly.<br/><br/>If an Lie’s teleporting distance was very far, he could let an lie go over first and then bring them over.<br/><br/>“If it’s teleporting distance, I can teleport to the center from one side of the river of Eternity!”<br/><br/>An lie said.<br/><br/>“At this distance?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian frowned slightly when he heard that. This distance was not very safe.<br/><br/>The range that the world of technology could investigate was about the size of the entire river of eternity.<br/><br/>Once an lie was teleported over, based on the technology of the world of technology, he would be able to detect some clues.<br/><br/>Now, Wang Xian could confirm that an lie’s ability belonged to the teleportation ability of the Void Royals in the Void Universe. Once he was discovered, it would be very troublesome.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I can now perform some simple controls on the Void Pagoda. If I were to control the Void Pagoda, the teleportation distance would be increased by ten times!”<br/><br/>At this moment, an lie added.<br/><br/>“Is that so?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes lit up. There was a hint of excitement in his eyes.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. Follow Me!”<br/><br/>He moved and immediately brought an lie along as they continued to fly deeper into the mountains and seas.<br/><br/>When they were still a distance away from the entrance of the world, he stopped.<br/><br/>He scanned his surroundings. After confirming that there were no experts around, Wang Xian gestured to an lie.<br/><br/>“Summon the Void Pagoda over.”<br/><br/>He spoke.<br/><br/>“Alright, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>An lie nodded. In the next moment, an incomparably huge void pagoda appeared in front of him.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, let’s Enter!”<br/><br/>An lie spoke to him and brought him directly to the seat controlled by the Void Pagoda!<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I’m sitting on the Void throne. My ability can be terrifyingly enhanced. Under the condition of sensing the space, I can sense the location in front of me. There’s a large number of experts gathered there. I can sense the other side of the starry universe. I can stretch far, far away.”<br/><br/>An lie sat on the Void throne and spoke to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Very good. Immediately teleport to the limit of the Void Pagoda and enter the starry universe. You Won’t be discovered, right?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian asked him.<br/><br/>“No. There are no experts at the entrance of the starry universe who can discover the Void Pagoda.”<br/><br/>As an lie spoke, he used the power of the Void Pagoda to sense rapidly. In the next moment, they disappeared!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
