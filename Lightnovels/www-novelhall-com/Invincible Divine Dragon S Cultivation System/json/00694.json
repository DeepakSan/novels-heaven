Dream on. If it was before, I might not be your match. But now, I have consumed the eternal embryo fruit. I can maintain my state of mind. You can forget about suppressing me!”<br/><br/>“Dragon King, you are too arrogant! Too arrogant!”<br/><br/>Ming shisheng looked extremely embarrassed when he saw Wang Xian chasing after him at such a terrifying speed!<br/><br/>However, at this moment, Ming Shaisheng had confidence and confidence in his heart!<br/><br/>“Roar Roar, Hundred Ghost Life, Run!”<br/><br/>In the next moment, his body immediately turned into more than 200 ghost avatars. Each of them flew in one direction!<br/><br/>“Hehe, Ming Shaisheng, I said you can’t run away, so you can’t run away!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw that he had more than 200 ghost avatars, he was also a little shocked.<br/><br/>He sneered and flapped his incipient saint wings. Countless thunderbolts and tornadoes shot toward the more than 200 netherspirit avatars!<br/><br/>“I want to escape. No One Can Catch Me!”<br/><br/>The Netherspirit let out a low growl. A dark force surged out from the more than 200 netherspirit avatars and blocked Wang Xian’s attack!<br/><br/>Crash<br/><br/>However, at this moment, Wang Xian focused his gaze and locked onto the Netherspirit’s main body. In an instant, he was above his head!<br/><br/>The strength of Ming Sha Sheng was due to the joint attack of Wang Xian and Ming Sha Sheng’s doppelganger!<br/><br/>Now that both of them were running away, his main body was very weak!<br/><br/>Wang Xian could easily kill Ming Sha Sheng in an instant!<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>The Dragon Claw swept past. It was filled with the power of destruction as it swept across Ming Sha Sheng’s body!<br/><br/>However, his dragon claw attack instantly passed through Ming Sha Sheng’s body. A black flame remained in the void!<br/><br/>His original body had disappeared!<br/><br/>“You have transformed with your clone, right? Then, I want to see how many times you can use this life-saving technique!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian snorted coldly!<br/><br/>Ming Shasheng’s move was very powerful. He had even transferred his body to his clone. It was a powerful life-saving technique!<br/><br/>However, in the next moment, Wang Xian flapped his incorporeal holy wings and instantly locked onto one of Ming Shasheng’s clones and attacked him directly!<br/><br/>The speed of Ming Shisheng’s avatars was only slightly faster than an ordinary level three master of the universe.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian’s speed was ten times faster than his!<br/><br/>Under such terrifying speed, unless he was given enough time, he wouldn’t be able to escape in a short period of time!<br/><br/>“How is this possible? How can you tell the location of my main body!”<br/><br/>Ming Shasheng’s expression changed drastically when he saw Wang Xian attacking his main body once again!<br/><br/>He could switch positions in his netherspirit’s clone, but this was not unlimited!<br/><br/>Furthermore, the distance between the main body and the clone was not unlimited!<br/><br/>Although this separation was far enough, there was still a limit!<br/><br/>Once he could be locked onto by the Dragon King, it would be difficult for him to escape with the Dragon King’s speed!<br/><br/>“I don’t believe that you can lock onto me forever!”<br/><br/>Ming shasheng gritted his teeth and more than 200 clones escaped in all directions at the fastest speed!<br/><br/>Bam<br/><br/>Wang Xian came to the position of his main body and swept his dragon claws once again!<br/><br/>However, this time, Ming Shasheng’s main body still disappeared instantly!<br/><br/>This ability was similar to teleportation. His clones were the medium for teleportation!<br/><br/>“HMPH!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian snorted softly. Through the lock-on of the primaless saint wings, he locked onto another Netherworld ghost doppelganger and attacked him.<br/><br/>I still have eight more chances. The possibility of me escaping is still very high<br/><br/>When Ming Shisheng saw Wang Xian locking onto his main body again, he thought to himself and calculated the distance between each of his Netherworld Ghost Doppelganger!<br/><br/>Whoosh<br/><br/>At this moment, his body was locked onto as a chain swept towards him.<br/><br/>Without any hesitation, Ming Shasheng used the energy conversion again and his avatars dissipated!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved his palm and the five elements millstone appeared in his hand. He flew towards the dozens of Netherspirit avatars!<br/><br/>His body moved and he flew towards Ming Shasheng’s main body once again!<br/><br/>“I’m locked on again. How far is his lock on? Damn it, the treasure in his hand is so terrifying. I Can’t teleport in that direction anymore. I have to retrieve the Netherspirit Avatars!”<br/><br/>Ming Shaisheng’s expression was extremely ugly. He could feel the terrifying energy and pressure from the five elements Millstone!<br/><br/>This was not something that his dozens of netherspirit avatars could contend against!<br/><br/>In order to kill his avatars, he could only retrieve them!<br/><br/>Once he reaped the rewards, there would be one less direction for him to escape to!<br/><br/>“Huala!”<br/><br/>“Ming Shasheng, I’ve said it before. You can’t escape unless you can transfer your main body without any restrictions!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian chased after his main body once again and said indifferently!<br/><br/>“Damn it!”<br/><br/>Ming Shisheng’s face was gloomy. He could only teleport again!<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian’s figure locked onto him again very quickly. He teleported again!<br/><br/>“I don’t think I can lock onto him, right? My two clones are already at the limit of their distance. Even if I fly by myself, I still need two minutes!”<br/><br/>Ming shisheng roared in a low voice with blood-red eyes as he teleported for the last time!<br/><br/>This shift was two minutes away from his original position!<br/><br/>This two minutes required him to fly at the fastest speed possible!<br/><br/>If he could still be locked on, then he would be finished!<br/><br/>“This Dragon King is simply too abnormal. Be it speed or treasures, no wonder the old witch and water demon were subdued by him. He’s too strong!”<br/><br/>He flew with all his might as he thought to himself!<br/><br/>“Can I still teleport?”<br/><br/>However, after more than ten seconds, a voice that terrified him sounded behind him. This caused his body to tremble violently, and the dark power in his body shook for a moment!<br/><br/>It’s over!<br/><br/>“I. . . Dragon King, I surrender, I surrender!”<br/><br/>Ming Shasheng was on the verge of collapse as he roared.<br/><br/>His transfer ability had been pushed to the limit. He could not continue to transfer anymore. If he was killed by the Dragon King, he would really die!<br/><br/>He had already found a way to break through. It would not be long before he could break through!<br/><br/>Should he let him die now?<br/><br/>How could he be willing to do so!<br/><br/>He had waited for billions of years to break through to the ruler realm. Should he let him die now?<br/><br/>It was better to submit!<br/><br/>“Hehe, what are you doing earlier?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled faintly. With a move of his palm, a drop of blood essence landed in front of him.<br/><br/>“Consume it and summon the universe God Nation over!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian ordered him!<br/><br/>“Yes, yes, Dragon King. I have completely submitted to you. I have decided to treat you as my king in the future!”<br/><br/>Ming Shasheng was helpless. He had no other choice but to say that!<br/><br/>If I submit, so be it. Fortunately, I can make a breakthrough!<br/><br/>Ming Shasheng’s submission made Wang Xian smile.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. Follow me back. There’s still an old crazy demon over there!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said indifferently. He brought Ming Shasheng and flew quickly toward the ancient Hengxu divine kingdom!<br/><br/>When he arrived at the ancient Hengxu Divine Kingdom, the demonic wings were constantly defending against the attacks of the water demon old witch and Wang Xian’s four netherspirit avatars!<br/><br/>However, he was completely suppressed!<br/><br/>Even if he was killed, it was only a matter of time!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
