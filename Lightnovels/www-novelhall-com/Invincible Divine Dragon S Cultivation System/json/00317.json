Someone has invaded! All citizens of Scorpion Imperial City, prepare for battle!”<br/><br/>“Prepare for battle! Kill, Kill, Kill!”<br/><br/>“Kill, Kill, Kill!”<br/><br/>In an instant, figures shot up into the sky from Scorpion Imperial City and flew towards Scorpion Imperial grotto-heaven.<br/><br/>Over ten million people in the city all rushed over at the same time.<br/><br/>A terrifying energy instantly shot up into the sky.<br/><br/>Faced with the invaders, everyone in the Scorpion Imperial City was united.<br/><br/>“HMPH!”<br/><br/>At the same time, Wang Xian snorted in the Scorpion Emperor Grotto-heaven.<br/><br/>In the entire Scorpion Emperor Grotto-heaven, no living creature could pose any threat to him, even the poisonous scorpion.<br/><br/>“Die!”<br/><br/>Many chains wrapped around the poisonous scorpion. The attacks of the surrounding universe Knight Level 7 experts couldn’t cause much damage when they landed on the chains.<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s dragon claws clawed at the Scorpion once again.<br/><br/>“No, no, no!”<br/><br/>“Run, run, run!”<br/><br/>When the numerous faces on the Scorpion’s head saw Wang Xian’s terrifying attack, all of them revealed terrified expressions.<br/><br/>They let out horrifying screams and shook their bodies in an attempt to escape.<br/><br/>However, in front of Wang Xian, the level 8 universe Knight did not have much power to resist.<br/><br/>The Dragon Claw grabbed onto the scorpion and waves of energy surged into its body.<br/><br/>“Oh no, our city Lord isn’t here. We Aren’t a match for the other party. Run, run, Run Now!”<br/><br/>The eyes of the Level 7 universe knight liches narrowed slightly when they saw this scene.<br/><br/>They knew that they weren’t a match for the other party.<br/><br/>Run!<br/><br/>At this moment, they could only run!<br/><br/>“Can we escape?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his dragon claw and the ferocious faces on the venomous scorpion crumbled.<br/><br/>He kept the venomous scorpion and flapped his incipient saint wings to attack them.<br/><br/>How terrifying was Wang Xian’s speed?<br/><br/>He was comparable to a Level 9 universe knight.<br/><br/>Even if they were experts in speed, they were still far from Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“No, no, don’t kill me!”<br/><br/>“All disciples, run, run!”<br/><br/>The Level 7 universe knights sensed Wang Xian’s speed, and despair appeared in their eyes.<br/><br/>There were liches begging for mercy, and there were liches warning the disciples in Scorpion Emperor City outside.<br/><br/>“Pu, Pu, Pu!”<br/><br/>But without exception, they were easily killed by Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>“Not good. The lords in the Scorpion Emperor’s Cave are no match for the intruders. Let us escape!”<br/><br/>The faces of the disciples of the Scorpion Emperor’s city who were flying over from all directions changed drastically when they heard the voices.<br/><br/>Many of the powerhouses stopped immediately.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>The next moment, a terrifying roar was heard.<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew out from the Scorpion Emperor’s Cave and transformed into the body of a divine dragon.<br/><br/>Currently, his body had already reached the size of 100,000 meters. His terrifying body was like a mountain, and it contained a terrifying pressure and aura.<br/><br/>He swayed his dragon body and swept his dragon tail in all directions.<br/><br/>A greyish energy attacked the surroundings at a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>“Not good, the opponent’s strength is terrifying. Let’s escape quickly!”<br/><br/>The liches in the scorpion imperial city sensed the might coming from Wang Xian and roared in fear.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>However, the terrifying destructive power had already caused the deaths of millions of liches instantly. Their corpses fell towards the ground.<br/><br/>“D * mn it. What kind of powerhouse did our scorpion imperial city offend to be so terrifying!”<br/><br/>Some of the liches in the scorpion imperial city sensed this scene and widened their eyes. They tried their best to escape into the distance.<br/><br/>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>“True Dragon Body, Fire Dragon God!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian let out a low roar. His entire body turned into a body of flames. A terrifying flame shot out in all directions.<br/><br/>That terrifying flame made all the liches in the surroundings look horrified.<br/><br/>“You want to escape? Today, this Dragon King will destroy the city!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with killing intent. With a thought, the five elements great mill flew backward.<br/><br/>He flew forward.<br/><br/>The five elements great mill expanded rapidly, reaching a radius of more than 100 million kilometers.<br/><br/>The various acquired Numinous Treasures and acquired Supreme Treasures that were absorbed attacked the liches one by one.<br/><br/>“Run, run, run!”<br/><br/>“Hide in your COSMOS GOD COUNTRY!”<br/><br/>“Run quickly!”<br/><br/>Faced with Wang Xian’s rampage, the scorpion imperial city had no way to resist.<br/><br/>Wang Xian swayed his huge body as flames attacked in all directions.<br/><br/>The surrounding mountain peaks collapsed and the buildings were set ablaze.<br/><br/>Half of the scorpion imperial city was engulfed in a sea of flames.<br/><br/>Coupled with Wang Xian’s terrifying speed, a large number of liches were killed by him.<br/><br/>Only a small number of them were able to escape.<br/><br/>The entire Scorpion Imperial city was being slaughtered by him rapidly.<br/><br/>At the same time, in the main city of the Lich Kingdom, the Lich City.<br/><br/>The Lich City stood on the body of a skeleton corpse.<br/><br/>The entire skeleton corpse was embedded in the ground. This skeleton corpse was so huge that it was abnormally terrifying.<br/><br/>It was rumored that at the beginning of the universe, life was born in the heaven-splitting prehistoric continent.<br/><br/>When Life was born, it suffered a great calamity and died in it.<br/><br/>Then, it merged with the heaven-splitting prehistoric continent and formed a special paradise.<br/><br/>Hundreds of liches stood excitedly in the huge skeleton’s head.<br/><br/>In the center of them, there was a huge pile of treasures.<br/><br/>When these treasures gathered together, even the great beings of the liches country were moved.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, this time our liches country’s harvest is not bad, every city will get a share of the resources!”<br/><br/>In the center of the huge pile of treasures, the liches king said with a face full of laughter.<br/><br/>“Liches king, this time’s income is at least equivalent to our harvest of over a hundred million years. Hehe, as expected of the strongest force in the surrounding starry skies, the accumulation is indeed rich!”<br/><br/>“Haha, that Dragon Palace still wants to compete with us. At most, there’s a universe Knight Level 8 great being, yet they still dare to compete with our Lich Kingdom. They’re simply courting death!”<br/><br/>“That’s right, even if we offend that Dragon Palace this time, it’s worth it to obtain these treasures!”<br/><br/>Around them, Universe Knight Level 8 liches laughed loudly.<br/><br/>This time, the harvest of their Lich Kingdom was simply too great!<br/><br/>The most important thing was that these gains were very easy for them, and they didn’t have to pay any price.<br/><br/>As for offending the Dragon Palace, they didn’t take it to heart.<br/><br/>Their strength was over 10 times that of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>If it wasn’t for the rules of the heaven opening primal continent, if the Dragon King dared to be arrogant in front of them, they would have killed him long ago.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
