Other than the arrival of the Dragon King, the three great domain-level races, the heavenly flame race, the Qianhai race, and the pangolin race, have arrived. Only the Nethersky race has yet to arrive.”<br/><br/>The old man below continued to report.<br/><br/>“I heard that the Nethersky race member has returned.”<br/><br/>Celestial Emperor Hong Tian said faintly.<br/><br/>“Yes, master. The Nethersky race member has suddenly returned after disappearing for tens of millions of years. It is said that he is trapped in the Mo Han clan’s ruins.”<br/><br/>The old man below said respectfully.<br/><br/>“Hehe, I wonder how much he has improved!”<br/><br/>God Emperor Hong Tian said faintly. His eyes were flashing with a cold expression.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Dragon King, the few from the Dragon Palace, this way please!”<br/><br/>On a planet beside the heaven-connecting tower, Wang Xian and the rest were led to a large hall by the experts from the Red Fog clan.<br/><br/>At this moment, many factions had arrived in the hall.<br/><br/>Among them, the stronger factions were all seated at the front.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest were also arranged to sit at the front.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, the three races in front are the strongest domain-level races in this starry sky.”<br/><br/>The voice of the heaven array was heard when Wang Xian and the rest sat down.<br/><br/>His gaze swept across the Heaven Flame race who was emitting flames all over. They were like the god of fire. They had a shell on their back, a tail, a body like a pangolin, and a head like a human.<br/><br/>They were a race from the human lineage of the Qian Hai.<br/><br/>There were three domain-level races and all of them had powerhouses at the peak of the Divine Emperor Realm.<br/><br/>This was the strongest faction in this starry sky.<br/><br/>While Wang Xian was scanning his surroundings, some of the factions in the hall were also paying attention to them.<br/><br/>The powerhouses from each faction carried a trace of curiosity and astonishment.<br/><br/>It was the first time the Dragon Palace stood in front of a group of factions.<br/><br/>“You must be the higher-ups of the Dragon Palace. I have to say that the assassination methods of Your Dragon Palace are really strong!”<br/><br/>Suddenly, a powerhouse from the Heaven Flame tribe, whose entire body was emitting flames, spoke faintly.<br/><br/>“A faction must have the ability to establish a clan. Otherwise, they can only be controlled by others. We are new to the Dragon Palace. Please forgive us!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard the words of the expert from the Heaven Flame clan, he cupped his fists and said with a smile on his face.<br/><br/>“There’s no need to bear with us. I heard that there are Asian Dragons in the Dragon Palace. Can you let us take a look?”<br/><br/>At the front, the expert from the mountain-piercing clan said faintly.<br/><br/>“There’s no need to take a look. Our Dragon Palace is afraid that you guys might do something wrong!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian said faintly.<br/><br/>“Haha, this person from the Dragon Palace is really interesting!”<br/><br/>An expert from the barren race of Qianhai laughed out loud.<br/><br/>Around them, the other factions heard their conversation and listened quietly from behind.<br/><br/>With the might of the Dragon Palace, ordinary domain-level races wouldn’t dare to be too arrogant towards them.<br/><br/>Only the few powerful races in the starry sky had the qualifications to do so.<br/><br/>“Welcome to the ceremony of our Red Mist race!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded.<br/><br/>Hearing this voice, everyone’s hearts trembled slightly.<br/><br/>“Weng!”<br/><br/>In front of the grand hall, the entire building in front of them suddenly disappeared, revealing an incomparably spacious road.<br/><br/>The road extended all the way forward, and an incomparably huge star appeared in his line of sight.<br/><br/>“This is?”<br/><br/>When everyone saw this scene, their pupils constricted slightly as they flashed with a luster.<br/><br/>“Everyone, please follow us!”<br/><br/>Two ninth-level divine emperor experts from the red fog race flew over and stood on both sides of the path. They greeted everyone respectfully.<br/><br/>“Hehe, it seems like divine emperor Hong Tian has occupied quite a number of stars in the Mo Han Clan Ruins!”<br/><br/>The experts from the various races in the Qian Hai stood up and walked toward the large path that had suddenly appeared with smiles on their faces.<br/><br/>The experts of the Pangshan clan and the Heavenly Flame clan also stood up and walked toward the road.<br/><br/>“There are a total of 9,999 planets in the ruins of the Mohan clan. It seems that Celestial Emperor Hong Tian has already cracked some of them!”<br/><br/>“Celestial Emperor Hong Tian’s strength is considered top-tier in our starry sky. His attainments in array formations should be unrivaled.”<br/><br/>“In the future, the foundation of the Red Mist clan will be the planets in the ruins of the Mohan Clan?”<br/><br/>The experts from some factions revealed astonished expressions as they walked forward one by one.<br/><br/>When they reached the Great Dao formed by the array formation, the experts moved very quickly.<br/><br/>In front of them was an incomparably huge star. There were many towering and enormous palaces on the star.<br/><br/>“Look to your left and right. God Emperor Hong Tian has definitely obtained quite a number of stars!”<br/><br/>At this moment, some experts looked around. In the surrounding void space, there were also many great dao that were connected to the stars.<br/><br/>As far as their eyes could see, they could see dozens of stars connected together.<br/><br/>“This… God Emperor Hong Tian has actually broken through so many stars!”<br/><br/>“Look over there. If I remember correctly, that is the divine garden star of the Mo Han clan. The Mo Han clan’s medicinal garden was also broken through by God Emperor Hong Tian!”<br/><br/>“Hiss, the Divine Garden Planet of the Mo Han clan ruins doesn’t have any powerful medicinal pills. Just that planet alone is worth quite a lot.”<br/><br/>“No Wonder God Emperor Hong Tian dared to establish a clan. So he has such a foundation.”<br/><br/>All the experts from the various factions looked over and revealed expressions of shock.<br/><br/>Even the eyes of the three top-tier domain-level experts were solemn.<br/><br/>After all, this was once a planet of a powerful universe’s primary race.<br/><br/>The group walked forward.<br/><br/>Their group didn’t have many people. There were more than 100 forces, a total of over 100,000 people.<br/><br/>“Are the disciples of the red fog race ahead?”<br/><br/>Walking all the way to the planet ahead, there were many experts of the red fog race on both sides.<br/><br/>They were lined up in two rows on the left and right.<br/><br/>The two rows were all disciples at the seventh rank of the godly monarch realm and above.<br/><br/>At a glance, there were more than 100,000 disciples at this level.<br/><br/>These were all the grand-disciples of the Hong Tian godly monarch.<br/><br/>Walking all the way forward, they arrived at a huge square. On the square, there were many huge flags.<br/><br/>The red flags were fluttering in the air.<br/><br/>In front of the plaza, stood over 50,000 experts of the red fog race.<br/><br/>Every single one of them was an existence at the divine emperor level.<br/><br/>“Hehe, many thanks to everyone for being able to participate in our red fog race’s founding ceremony!”<br/><br/>Sitting on the central throne at the very front of the plaza, Divine Emperor Hong Tian was seated there.<br/><br/>Upon seeing the arrival of a group of factions, a faint smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>Everyone’s gazes were looking forward, their eyes flickering with a luster.<br/><br/>“Celestial Emperor Hong Tian has established a race. We will naturally come forward to present our congratulatory gifts. Congratulations!”<br/><br/>An old man from the desolate race of the Qian Hai said lightly.<br/><br/>“Haha, everyone being able to come is giving face to me, Hong Tian.”<br/><br/>Celestial Emperor Hong Tian laughed loudly and stood up.<br/><br/>“Today, i, Celestial Emperor Hong Tian, announce the establishment of the Red Mist race. We will conquer the starry skies and sweep through all directions!”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
