It seemed to be filled with mystery and yearning.<br/><br/>“Do you still want revenge?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stared at him with a mocking expression on his face.<br/><br/>“Netherworld Dragon, give chase! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian growled and a black hole appeared around his body as well!<br/><br/>He waved his dragon claw and a surge of energy enveloped the group of people.<br/><br/>Following that, the group of people entered the black hole directly!<br/><br/>Buzz<br/><br/>When the old man from the belief universe had just escaped from the black hole.<br/><br/>At the side, Wang Xian and the rest also appeared at the side.<br/><br/>When the Old Man of Heaven’s origin who believed in the universe saw this scene, his heart sank and his face turned extremely ugly!<br/><br/>Without any hesitation, he immediately fled into the distance!<br/><br/>“It’s a little slow! ”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw the speed of his escape, a cold expression appeared on his face!<br/><br/>Waving his dragon tail, a huge shadow of a dragon tail swept out behind him.<br/><br/>Behind the old man, a huge face formed by countless shadows of believers appeared and blocked behind him!<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>A terrifying collision sound was heard.<br/><br/>The defense formed by believers was instantly shattered. The huge dragon tail swept across his body, causing his body to start to collapse!<br/><br/>The old man let out a miserable cry. His body staggered and he continued to fly forward!<br/><br/>With his current condition, he could not withstand Wang Xian’s attack at all.<br/><br/>“Immortal binding! ”<br/><br/>At the side, Tianci waved his arm and released the most powerful branches of the Ancient Tree of Destiny in his body.<br/><br/>The branches seemed to have turned into a terrifying rope and coiled toward the old man!<br/><br/>“Run, run, run!”<br/><br/>The old man swallowed a mouthful of blood and ran forward desperately.<br/><br/>“Whoosh! ”<br/><br/>However, in the next instant, that bundle of immortal branches appeared around the old man as if it had teleported and coiled around him.<br/><br/>The old man didn’t even have time to dodge before he was instantly bound!<br/><br/>“Not good!”<br/><br/>Seeing that he was bound before he could react, his face was filled with terror.<br/><br/>The other party was too strong, so strong that he didn’t have the slightest ability to resist!<br/><br/>All he could do was run away, frantically running away.<br/><br/>Seeing that he was entangled, he did not hesitate at all and took out two blood -red hearts.<br/><br/>The Hearts were still beating, so he crushed one of them!<br/><br/>The other heart instantly disappeared!<br/><br/>His body trembled.<br/><br/>However, the next moment, his eyes widened, and his face was filled with disbelief.<br/><br/>“How is this possible? My Faith Connection Heart actually lost its effect!” He roared.<br/><br/>At this moment, he saw that the rope on his body was emitting a green light.<br/><br/>The immortal binding branches emitted sharp thorns and entered his body.<br/><br/>It made it impossible for him to escape!<br/><br/>This made his eyes reveal a hint of despair!<br/><br/>At this moment, the figure of the Void Dragon appeared behind him.<br/><br/>The Void Dragon grabbed the five elements millstone with its claws and attacked him directly!<br/><br/>“It’s over! ”<br/><br/>He raised his head and looked at this attack with a look of despair on his face.<br/><br/>The difference in strength was too great!<br/><br/>It was so great that he didn’t even have the strength to dodge.<br/><br/>He couldn’t even escape.<br/><br/>With the opponent’s strength, even if they were to surround and attack an existence at the Great Dao level, they wouldn’t be at a disadvantage. In fact, they would even have the upper hand!<br/><br/>This time, he admitted defeat!<br/><br/>The Void Divine Dragon carried the attacks of the five elemental grindstone and landed on his body. It quickly wiped out his vitality.<br/><br/>Wang Xian immediately flew over. He waved his dragon claw and smiled.<br/><br/>He had succeeded in killing him!<br/><br/>He couldn’t even escape.<br/><br/>There were many tricks and trump cards of a powerhouse at the control level.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian and the rest had even more trump cards and tricks.<br/><br/>With a wave of his arm, Wang Xian kept the corpses.<br/><br/>Now, he had obtained two more corpses of a powerhouse at the heaven origin creation level.<br/><br/>One of them was at the beginner level while the other was at the control level.<br/><br/>As for the corpses of a powerhouse at the heaven origin creation level who believed in the universe, their effects far surpassed that of other powerhouses at the heaven origin creation level.<br/><br/>That was because they possessed the heart of faith.<br/><br/>The heart of faith could allow other cultivators to increase their cultivation speed.<br/><br/>It was convenient to break through the shackles, and it had a great effect.<br/><br/>Especially the heart of faith of the Great Beings of the heaven origin creation realm who believed in the universe.<br/><br/>This was much more valuable than the bodies of the other great beings of the heaven origin creation realm.<br/><br/>For the Great Beings at the pinnacle level of universe masters, this was the most precious true treasure.<br/><br/>If a powerhouse at the peak of the Universe Dominator could absorb a heart of faith, the probability of him becoming a powerhouse at the Heaven origin creation realm would increase by at least 50% .<br/><br/>This was a very high probability!<br/><br/>According to Wang Xian’s estimation, if a powerhouse at the peak of the Universe Dominator realm like the floating queen absorbed it, the probability of him becoming a powerhouse at the heaven origin creation realm would reach 80% .<br/><br/>Of course, Wang Xian would not give such a treasure to the floating water queen.<br/><br/>Wang Xian would give the heart of faith in these two corpses to the disciples of the Dragon Palace or even absorb it himself in the future.<br/><br/>This was especially so for the corpse of the old man who was at the control level.<br/><br/>“He… he actually killed him so quickly! ”<br/><br/>Liu Lan and Wangtian, who were at the side, saw this scene. Their eyes were wide open and their faces were filled with shock.<br/><br/>Two powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin realm.<br/><br/>One of them was even stronger than the two of them when they joined forces.<br/><br/>However, he was completely killed in such a short period of time.<br/><br/>They did not help at all.<br/><br/>One of them was a beginner while the other was at the control level. They killed him directly.<br/><br/>They looked at Wang Xian again with respect.<br/><br/>The Dragon King’s strength was much, much stronger than before.<br/><br/>Especially when they saw Wang Xian ‘s attack just now.<br/><br/>Compared to when he dealt with the Agar Heavenly Demon God, the difference was like the difference between heaven and earth!<br/><br/>This improvement was too terrifying!<br/><br/>“Alright, the crisis of your sword and Magic Universe has been temporarily resolved. As for whether they will make a comeback, it’s hard to say. However, I think we might have to consider it when the universe of faith deals with you in the future!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian kept the corpse and said to Liu Lan and Wangtian with a smile.<br/><br/>The harvest this time was huge!<br/><br/>“Thank you, Dragon King. Thank you for your help!”<br/><br/>Liu Lan and Wangtian quickly thanked him.<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head. “You’re welcome. We’re friends. Let’s go back! ”<br/><br/>“It’s you, Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>Liu Lan Wangtian was completely convinced by Wang Xian at this moment. He also felt some respect in his heart and nodded his head.<br/><br/>Wang Xian took a glance at the construction altar and kept it all.<br/><br/>Then, they flew toward the sword and Magic Universe.<br/><br/>The encirclement this time was very successful.<br/><br/>However, just as Wang Xian arrived at the sword and Magic Universe, a piece of good news suddenly came!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
