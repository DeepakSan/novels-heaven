The Great Elf Appeared!</h1><div class=\"entry-content\" id=\"htmlContent\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3448 The Archangel 3447 appeared! The Great Elf appeared!<br/><br/>“Dad, Dad, I’m awake. Dad, there’s a treasure ahead. Let’s Go get it.”<br/><br/>In the center of the river of eternity, where the water in the sky fell, Wang Xian looked ahead in shock.<br/><br/>Suddenly, a little elf flew out of his body and said cheerfully.<br/><br/>“Huh?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He looked at the little guy in astonishment.<br/><br/>“Lingling, you’re Awake?”<br/><br/>He revealed a smile.<br/><br/>Wang Lingling, who was also Wang Xian’s daughter, the accompanying Elf, had been hiding in her body ever since she entered the heaven-splitting primordial land.<br/><br/>Later on, after Wang Xian obtained lei yu and completely integrated the inceptive holy wings to increase his strength, the little fellow began to improve as well. She went into a deep sleep.<br/><br/>Following that, Wang Xian’s realm improved again. She followed suit and did not wake up.<br/><br/>The strength of the accompanying Elf would increase along with the strength of the host. After a few years of deep sleep, the supporting power of the spirit spirit was already at the level of the first-grade ruler of the universe.<br/><br/>The reason why she had been in a deep sleep for so long was mainly because Wang Xian’s strength had improved too quickly.<br/><br/>After all, the little fellow had the body of an elf. She wasn’t as perverse as Wang Xian with his nine attributes.<br/><br/>“I’m awake. My spirit has improved a lot this time. Look at my wings. Aren’t they beautiful?”<br/><br/>The spirit flew to his front and proudly flaunted her wings.<br/><br/>One had the Lightning attribute and the other had the wind attribute. They were exactly the same as Wang Xian’s primaless holy wings.<br/><br/>“Oh?”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw them, he raised his eyebrows slightly and stroked her head. “Beautiful, beautiful.”<br/><br/>The accompanying Elf grew up with the host and had the chance to inherit some of the host’s abilities.<br/><br/>Clearly, the little one had gained a lot of benefits from this upgrade.<br/><br/>“Dad, let’s go. Let’s go and grab some treasures. There are powerful treasures there.”<br/><br/>The spirit pointed to the location in front of them and said.<br/><br/>“There are treasures there, but there are also powerful space beasts there. We can’t go near them.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head.<br/><br/>“Space Beasts. Let’s kill them and eat them.”<br/><br/>Lingling bared her teeth and said.<br/><br/>“It’s already good enough that it won’t eat us.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian pinched her cheek speechlessly.<br/><br/>“But Lingling likes that treasure very much.”<br/><br/>Lingling pouted.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was slightly stunned. With a move of his palm, a ninth-grade water lotus appeared in front of Lingling.<br/><br/>“How about this?”<br/><br/>He said with a smile.<br/><br/>“This is also very good and very beautiful. Did Daddy Give It to me?”<br/><br/>Lingling said excitedly.<br/><br/>“Can you use it?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at her in surprise.<br/><br/>“Yes, it grew on the mother of the ancestral tree. I can control it too.”<br/><br/>As Lingling spoke, she raised her small staff. The ninth-grade water lotus began to shrink and landed on the staff.<br/><br/>“Hehe, it’s so beautiful!”<br/><br/>When she saw it, she waved her staff happily and spun it happily.<br/><br/>“I still have the ninth-grade water lotus here. Do you want more?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian took out the other four water lotus flowers and floated in front of her.<br/><br/>“I want them, Lingling wants them. I want to wear them on my head, Hehe.”<br/><br/>Lingling waved the staff in her hand and the water lotuses shrunk and landed on her head. This caused Wang Xian’s eyes to be filled with astonishment.<br/><br/>The four water lotuses landed on her body. This could give her a considerable boost.<br/><br/>“The accompanying elves don’t seem to be that powerful, right? Could it be because of the ancestral tree?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled to himself. The Tree of life of the Elves was a treasure that was the closest to the Heaven’s origin level. However, it was still the same as the Heaven’s sting.<br/><br/>The accompanying elves nurtured by the ancestral tree were definitely not comparable to the ordinary accompanying elves in terms of potential and abilities.<br/><br/>For example, she was able to control four ninth-grade water lotuses now.<br/><br/>Even though the spirit spirits were all auxiliary means, they were still extremely terrifying.<br/><br/>With the five elements grinding technique and the spirit spirit, it wouldn’t be too much of a problem for him to deal with eight to nine people of the same level.<br/><br/>“I’m getting more and more awesome, Hehe!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian couldn’t help but laugh.<br/><br/>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh<br/><br/>At this moment, Wang Xian sensed that there were experts flying over from the surroundings.<br/><br/>He took a look and realized that it was a cave master from the Lotus Peak.<br/><br/>The figure flew over and noticed Wang Xian as well. He stopped and looked forward with a face full of shock.<br/><br/>“This is definitely the birth of a twelfth-grade water lotus!”<br/><br/>Very soon, his breathing became slightly rapid as he spoke. A sixth-grade water lotus appeared in his palm.<br/><br/>This energy was exactly the same!<br/><br/>Wang Xian took a look and stood there quietly without making any movements.<br/><br/>What a joke. A treasure of the twelfth grade water lotus was not something they could covet.<br/><br/>With the space behemoth there, unless there were powerhouses from the top races coming over, they would all die.<br/><br/>As time passed, more and more powerhouses rushed over.<br/><br/>They looked at the powerful energy in front of them in shock. Their eyes were filled with excitement.<br/><br/>However, no one dared to enter.<br/><br/>“If this energy is like this for a long period of time, there might really be experts from the top races of the universe coming over. After all, this is an innate treasure!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself.<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. Three days later, the power of the 12th grade water lotus did not disappear.<br/><br/>Some people said that it would take more time for the birth of an innate treasure.<br/><br/>Many experts had already gathered at the center of the Heavenly Heng River, and even more experts had rushed over upon hearing the news.<br/><br/>On the universe’s AI, the situation here was also in an uproar, even overshadowing the topics of the ancestral dragon and the Holy Dragon lineage.<br/><br/>“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”<br/><br/>On the fourth day, everyone suddenly felt the sky suddenly brighten up, accompanied by a special rhythm.<br/><br/>The rhythm entered everyone’s ears. It was as if they were welcoming them, as if they were here!<br/><br/>This was the message brought by the rhythm.<br/><br/>“This is?”<br/><br/>Everyone’s expression changed slightly. They immediately flew towards the river.<br/><br/>Wang Xian moved without any hesitation.<br/><br/>When he arrived at the river, his gaze swept across his surroundings. His face was filled with shock.<br/><br/>An archangel with twelve wings was floating in the air. It was emitting a holy luster.<br/><br/>He stared at the spot below him without moving.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest were far away from him, but he could still feel the terrifying energy contained in his body.<br/><br/>This was… an archangel of the angel race, the twelve-winged Angel!<br/><br/>“Dad, I can sense a familiar aura about to appear!”<br/><br/>Lingling, who was sitting on Wang Xian’s shoulder, suddenly spoke.<br/><br/>“Huala!”<br/><br/>As soon as she finished her sentence, everyone saw that the starry sky seemed to have been torn apart.<br/><br/>A woman with a bow and arrow on her back, the leaves on her body condensed into clothes, and a perfect face appeared.<br/><br/>She looked at the twelve-winged angel not far away with a calm gaze.<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw the figure that appeared again, his pupils constricted slightly.<br/><br/>This was… The Great Elf of the Elf race.<br/><br/>“This… This is a master of the universe, a true master of the universe. The twelve-winged angel, the Great Elf of the Arrow of life.”<br/><br/>From the surrounding area, a shocked voice rang out.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
