If the Saints of your admission universe resurrect in the future and come to slaughter you all, or if the powerhouses of the evil sequence camp come to slaughter you, carve some words on it. If I have time, I can rush over!”<br/><br/>“If you are killed by accident, I will come here to take a look too!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his arm and threw a branch of the soul-returning wood to the old man at the front.<br/><br/>As long as the old man carved some words on the branch of the soul-returning wood, Wang Xian would be able to sense it. When he had the time, he could come over and help!<br/><br/>Wang Xian was not a saint. However, when he saw this tragic universe, he could not bear to see all the living beings being slaughtered!<br/><br/>However, it was obviously impossible for him to keep watch over this place.<br/><br/>This method could be considered as a small help to the living beings in the universe.<br/><br/>In addition, Wang Xian was very displeased with the Haoyang saint and Buddha saint.<br/><br/>They even said that they wanted to take revenge on him and make the nine-origin universe pay the price?<br/><br/>Then, Wang Xian would play with them to the end.<br/><br/>If the disciples of the universe really reported the information to him, then he would not mind coming over and killing the Buddha saint and Haoyang Saint!<br/><br/>After Wang Xian gave the soul-returning wood to the old man, his figure moved and disappeared immediately!<br/><br/>The tens of thousands of disciples of the nalantian universe were left kneeling there in a Daze!<br/><br/>“Sigh!”<br/><br/>The old man in the lead sighed and treasured the soul-returning wood branch into his arms!<br/><br/>Perhaps, at the critical moment, this was their life-saving straw!<br/><br/>“Let’s go to the riot zone and take a look!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew out of the cashier universe and took a look at the route on the map. He made a decision in his heart.<br/><br/>In the chaos, it was not all Gray and dead silent.<br/><br/>In the chaos, there were giant beasts of chaos and the god of elements. In addition, there were some special domains.<br/><br/>The riot zone was one of these special domains!<br/><br/>In the chaos, as long as it was not a gray area, it would definitely contain Great Terror, great danger, and great opportunities.<br/><br/>The weakest thing that could be special in the chaos must be at the peak of the ruler realm.<br/><br/>In the riot zone, according to the treasure map and some records on the map, this was a domain with extremely violent energy!<br/><br/>The violent energy would definitely give birth to treasures that would evolve.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian did not know the specific situation of the riot zone.<br/><br/>“If I want to reach the riot zone, I need to pass through the Alliance of Justice.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself as he flew rapidly in the chaotic space.<br/><br/>Based on such a long distance, it would take at least tens of millions of years for him to fly there!<br/><br/>“It’s a little far. Let’s see if there’s a teleportation station between the universes after I reach the Alliance of Justice!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled.<br/><br/>Time passed day by day. A few million years passed in the blink of an eye!<br/><br/>Wang Xian flew for more than a hundred years and arrived at the boundary of the Justice Union universe!<br/><br/>He looked at the universe in front of him and flew straight over.<br/><br/>Once he entered the Justice Union universe, the Tian Yuan communicator that Wang Xian bought from the Justice Union universe would be able to communicate and check information!<br/><br/>The coverage of the Tian Yuan Communicator was around the Justice Sequence Alliance.<br/><br/>If Wang Xian was in the nine-origin universe, he would not be able to receive information.<br/><br/>He could not use it!<br/><br/>He could use it here!<br/><br/>Wang Xian searched for information through the Tian Yuan Communicator before he continued to fly towards the interior of the Justice Sequence Alliance.<br/><br/>In the interior of the Justice Sequence Alliance, many universes were connected to each other by teleportation formations.<br/><br/>Originally, it would take more than 10,000 years to travel to another universe. However, it would only take more than 10 days to travel through the teleportation formation!<br/><br/>This could be said to have greatly shortened the time!<br/><br/>If Wang Xian could use the teleportation formation, he could save seven to eight million years of time!<br/><br/>He continued to fly forward. After 20,000 years, Wang Xian arrived in a universe.<br/><br/>This was a powerful universe. It belonged to a powerful existence within the Justice Sequence Alliance.<br/><br/>On this planet, there was a teleportation formation that could be used to teleport to other universes.<br/><br/>Wang Xian began to teleport one by one through the teleportation formation.<br/><br/>More than ten days later, he arrived in another universe and continued to teleport.<br/><br/>A few months later, he arrived at the Justice Universe.<br/><br/>He came to this prosperous and prosperous universe once again. Wang Xian took a rest here. He opened his heaven-origin communication device and took a look at it in detail!<br/><br/>“There are fewer requests for reinforcements from other universes in the Justice Union. However, there are quite a number of universes that have joined the Justice Union!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the information and thought to himself.<br/><br/>The powers of the Justice Union started to radiate towards their surroundings.<br/><br/>More and more universes wanted to join the Justice Union!<br/><br/>Joining the justice union was indeed beneficial to some weaker universes.<br/><br/>At least he would have some protection against powerful invaders.<br/><br/>He also received another piece of news.<br/><br/>Currently, there were very few people from the evil sequence faction attacking the universe of the Alliance of Justice.<br/><br/>These experts from the evil sequence faction shifted their target to other neutral universes.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the information and then exchanged some space-attribute treasures into resources that he could use.<br/><br/>It was very convenient to trade in the universe of justice.<br/><br/>As long as there were sufficient resources, he could exchange for the fragments of the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan.<br/><br/>He could even exchange for some spots for breakthroughs.<br/><br/>After spending some time in the universe of justice, Wang Xian continued to head towards the riot zone.<br/><br/>Through the teleportation formation and flying, he traveled for another million years.<br/><br/>“I can find quite a number of strong disciples in the surrounding chaos.”<br/><br/>The closer he got to the riot zone, the more strong disciples he encountered.<br/><br/>Strong practitioners in the Heaven’s origin blessed realm and disciples at the peak of the Dominator realm.<br/><br/>He could meet them every few years.<br/><br/>The density of strong practitioners and disciples was already very high!<br/><br/>“It seems that many strong disciples in this riot zone know about it. Many strong disciples will rush over!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian thought to himself.<br/><br/>Even a fool would know about the existence of treasures in a special region in the chaos.<br/><br/>In fact, the chaos could even give birth to powerful ultimate treasures of the Heaven’s origin!<br/><br/>Wang Xian continued to fly forward. Soon, an area that was emitting gray light appeared in his line of sight!<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the location where the gray light was emitted and a stunned expression appeared on his face.<br/><br/>The area covered by the gray light was much wider and larger than the area covered by the light emitted by a universe!<br/><br/>There was an energy inside that made Wang Xian’s heart palpitate.<br/><br/>The gray light was slightly different from the chaotic, blackish gray.<br/><br/>The gray here was lighter and emitted a luster.<br/><br/>In the area covered by the gray light, there were some light spots of other colors!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
