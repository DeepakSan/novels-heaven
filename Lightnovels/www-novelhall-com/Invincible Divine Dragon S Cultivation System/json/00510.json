They actually opened it?”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian saw that the Dragon Palace was opened, a look of surprise appeared on his face.<br/><br/>“The experts of our ancestral dragon lineage once said that if they were to die, as long as they have the bloodline of the purebred divine dragon of the ancestral dragon lineage, they would have a high chance of opening their Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>The figure with the Green Dragon Beard said with a smile.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. This was also the trust that the experts of the ancestral dragon lineage had in their disciples. They didn’t want their treasures to be obtained by others or to fall into silence after their accidental death.<br/><br/>When the Azure Dragon Palace was opened, a gush of azure dragon aura came gushing over.<br/><br/>The eyes of the figures with the Azure Dragon Beard flickered as they walked straight into the palace.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, Please!”<br/><br/>As they spoke, Wang Xian followed closely behind them.<br/><br/>The moment they entered, they saw a gigantic tree.<br/><br/>The gigantic tree was located on the left and right of the front. There were eight words carved on it.<br/><br/>The Divine Dragon was in high spirits!<br/><br/>He was at the peak again!<br/><br/>These eight words expressed the hopes of this Green Dragon senior for the Divine Dragon Clan.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, he would never be able to see the moment when the Divine Dragon was at the peak again.<br/><br/>Looking at these words, the Azure Dragon, Xu Ying, and the rest felt a chill in their hearts as they bowed respectfully.<br/><br/>Wang Xian also bowed his body. He was extremely respectful towards such a strong person.<br/><br/>“We, the disciples of the ancestral dragon, have stepped into the senior’s Dragon Palace and inherited the senior’s Dragon Palace and will. We will definitely avenge the senior!”<br/><br/>The Azure Dragon, Xu Ying, and the rest were filled with killing intent as they swore with respect.<br/><br/>After pausing in front for a few seconds, everyone walked in.<br/><br/>The layout of the Dragon Palace was basically the same. After passing through the position in front, they arrived at the herb garden of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“So many divine fruits and divine trees!”<br/><br/>Upon arriving at the herb garden, Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a look of astonishment.<br/><br/>In this Dragon Palace of Senior Green Dragon, there were many divine herbs and divine fruits and trees of the third level of the universe dominator. They were definitely priceless.<br/><br/>The group looked at them but didn’t take them away immediately.<br/><br/>They didn’t just want to take away these treasures, they wanted to take away the entire Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The group continued to walk forward, and the Dragon King Palace appeared in everyone’s sight.<br/><br/>After entering the Dragon King Palace, there were flowers on the left and right sides.<br/><br/>The flowers were extremely beautiful and fragrant!<br/><br/>“They have intelligence!”<br/><br/>The voice of the water touch king suddenly sounded.<br/><br/>“Are you all experts from the ancestral dragon lineage?”<br/><br/>As soon as she finished speaking, the flowers around her immediately transformed into human forms. They stared at them and asked.<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>The Azure Dragon Whisker Shadow and the others were slightly shocked and immediately nodded.<br/><br/>“We are the Azure Dragon Disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage, the descendants of the Azure Dragon Loin Flower Lord!”<br/><br/>Green Dragon Beard Shadow and the others immediately transformed into godly dragons to reveal their identities.<br/><br/>“Sister is already dead, and she will never be able to return.”<br/><br/>More than ten women who had transformed into flowers said sadly, their eyes filled with tears.<br/><br/>“We will inherit senior’s will.”<br/><br/>Green Dragon Beard Shadow and the others bowed to the flower fairies.<br/><br/>“Sister said that if she dies, the great beings of the ancestral dragon lineage who are wood-elemental universe masters and above can inherit everything from her.”<br/><br/>A flower fairy in the middle said as she looked at them. “Which one of you will inherit this Dragon Palace?”<br/><br/>“Dragon King, I will inherit this Dragon Palace. All the resources in the Dragon Palace will belong to you. If it wasn’t for you, we wouldn’t have been able to obtain senior’s Dragon Palace. Perhaps, it would have fallen into the hands of the Holy Dragon.”<br/><br/>The Green Dragon Whisker looked at Wang Xian, cupped his hands and said.<br/><br/>“Alright.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded his head slightly.<br/><br/>A Dragon Palace belonging to a Master of the universe with level three combat strength was worth a lot.<br/><br/>However, the value of the treasures in this dragon palace was slightly higher than this dragon palace.<br/><br/>Wang Xian was very satisfied with his gains.<br/><br/>After all, this dragon palace belonged to the ancestral dragon lineage.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Two more level two universe masters, the Divine Light Dragons, have fallen?”<br/><br/>At the same time, in a void space, the Holy Dragon King received the news from his subordinates. His face was extremely gloomy.<br/><br/>The Divine Light Dragons were the backbone of the Holy Dragon lineage. There were less than 100 pure-blooded divine light dragons in the entire holy dragon lineage.<br/><br/>There were even fewer level two universe masters.<br/><br/>Yet another two had fallen.<br/><br/>“Lord Holy Dragon Emperor, they were ambushed and killed when they were trying to take over the Green Dragon Palace. The other party’s strength is terrifying.”<br/><br/>Beside him, a light dragon reported.<br/><br/>“Ancestral dragon lineage, HMPH, leave the matters over there to the Tian Zhi clan. Tell them that we don’t want the Green Dragon Palace anymore, we’ll give it all to them.”<br/><br/>The Sacred Dragon King coldly snorted and said.<br/><br/>“It’s the Sacred Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The divine light dragon beside him immediately replied.<br/><br/>“Ancestral Dragon Bloodline, you’re not far from extinction!”<br/><br/>The Sacred Dragon King stared at the Phantom in front of him, his eyes filled with killing intent.<br/><br/>His body moved and he flew straight ahead.<br/><br/>Soon, he was in an extremely large forest. It was a very special forest.<br/><br/>The trees were running, and the grass was flying around.<br/><br/>The branches were dancing.<br/><br/>In the center, there was a huge tree.<br/><br/>The whole tree covered the sky and the Sun, and it was as big as a few planets.<br/><br/>In the sky above the trees, a few trees slowly landed on the ground.<br/><br/>“The Dragon Palace of a level three universe master is very useful to us. I’ll come here personally, and the eight of you will take the Dragon Palace with me!”<br/><br/>A Golden Sky Plant Demon Beast said lightly.<br/><br/>“It’s Lord Jin Huan. We have to go there as soon as possible. Otherwise, the ancestral dragon bloodline might get the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>A Sky Plant Demon Beast replied immediately.<br/><br/>“Have you placed the sky plant seeds?”<br/><br/>The ten-meter tall, human-shaped Golden Sky Plant Demon Beast glanced at his three subordinates and asked.<br/><br/>“The seeds have been planted!”<br/><br/>The three sky plant demonic beasts were the three sky plant demonic beasts that had escaped not long ago. They replied.<br/><br/>“Let’s go, we’ll go there immediately!”<br/><br/>The Golden Hoop plant demonic beast replied indifferently. He extended a branch and a seed appeared in front of him.<br/><br/>Slowly, his body began to enter the seed.<br/><br/>This time was extremely slow. After five to six hours, only half of his body had disappeared.<br/><br/>At the same time, at a certain part of the underground river, a seed buried at the bottom of the river slowly began to grow.<br/><br/>One by one, huge flowers appeared and slowly bloomed.<br/><br/>After more than ten hours, the nine seeds grew to more than ten meters in size. They looked like lotuses, but they were in bloom.<br/><br/>At this time, the lotuses began to bloom, and figures appeared within.<br/><br/>The powerhouses of the sky-planting demonic beasts.<br/><br/>This was one of the powerful abilities of the sky-planting demonic beasts. As long as they left seeds in one place, their real bodies could be transferred here.<br/><br/>Although it would take a long process, compared to rushing here, it could save a lot of time.<br/><br/>Of course, this also had a disadvantage. If the seeds were destroyed, or if the seeds were destroyed when they were growing.<br/><br/>Then they wouldn’t be able to teleport over either.<br/><br/>“Let’s go and destroy the disciples of the ancestral dragon lineage. The Azure Dragon Palace belongs to us.”<br/><br/>The Golden Hoop Sky Plant Demon Beast’s body emitted a luster and a murderous aura.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
