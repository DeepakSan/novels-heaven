Sometimes, there were no clouds in the sky, and sometimes, there was a sudden rainstorm.<br/><br/>Today, the sudden rainstorm covered more than half of the Milky Way.<br/><br/>The Milky Way in the rainstorm was a time when all kinds of desolate beasts in the water were very active.<br/><br/>It was also a good day for fishing.<br/><br/>Every time there was a rainstorm, many anglers would enter the Milky Way in groups.<br/><br/>“From the looks of the situation, this rainstorm should be able to last for half a month. Let’s see if we can gain more during this half a month.”<br/><br/>“Our strength is still too weak. We can only fish here. Sigh, when will we be able to reach the fifth level divine emperor or above?”<br/><br/>In the Milky Way, more than ten middle-aged men were talking to each other in front of them.<br/><br/>“It’s so difficult to cultivate. It takes tens of millions of years to cultivate, and one seclusion is millions of years. I feel like most of my life is spent in seclusion.”<br/><br/>A middle-aged man in the center shook his head.<br/><br/>“Don’t say such disheartening words. By the way, I heard that the people of the nine swords race have returned? Is there any gossip now?”<br/><br/>A man changed the topic and said.<br/><br/>“It’s really strange. Why did the nine swords race come back after they escaped? Aren’t they afraid of being destroyed by the Dragon Palace…”<br/><br/>“Look over there quickly.”<br/><br/>A middle-aged man was suddenly interrupted as he spoke. One of them pointed to the back with an incredulous look in his eyes.<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>“What’s That?”<br/><br/>“It’s the Skeleton Island. It’s the skeleton island of the skeleton race. What’s going on? Why is the skeleton island speeding in the Milky Way?”<br/><br/>Everyone immediately looked over and widened their eyes.<br/><br/>The skeleton race was one of the top existences in the Milky Way.<br/><br/>Even though the skeleton island forbade people from entering, everyone in the Milky Way knew very well about the skeleton island.<br/><br/>The Skeleton Island was the base camp of the skeleton race. Their territory and numbers were relatively few in the Milky Way.<br/><br/>The Skeleton Island’s area was only the size of four to five stars.<br/><br/>The Skeleton Island had always been located next to the dark region. Why was it suddenly moving through the Milky Way?<br/><br/>This was equivalent to the entire skeleton race using all their strength.<br/><br/>“Hurry up and get out of the way!”<br/><br/>Everyone immediately hid to the side. The Skeleton Island was getting closer and closer to them.<br/><br/>A terrifying aura rushed over.<br/><br/>“Look at the front of the Skeleton Island. There are many members of the skeleton race. They are holding weapons. Are they preparing to fight?”<br/><br/>“Look at the center. Those are members of the nine-sword clan. Oh My God, what are they doing there?”<br/><br/>Soon, everyone was shocked.<br/><br/>The Nine-sword clan was still on the Skeleton Island.<br/><br/>Judging from their aggressive look, it was obviously not an ordinary thing.<br/><br/>“They are heading toward the volcano region and the Dragon Palace. Don’t tell me!”<br/><br/>A middle-aged man said as his pupils contracted and his face was full of shock.<br/><br/>“The nine-sword race said that they are back. Are they going to attack the Dragon Palace with the skeleton race? It is possible!”<br/><br/>“Although the skeleton race is powerful, it is impossible to destroy the Dragon Palace, right? Even with the nine-sword race.”<br/><br/>“Since the skeleton clan dares to attack, they must be confident that they can destroy the Dragon Palace. Otherwise, why would they suddenly attack?”<br/><br/>“Why did they suddenly attack the Dragon Palace? Is it because of the Divine Dragon Bloodline? It’s said that the Dragon Palace has a pure-blooded divine dragon.”<br/><br/>The crowd discussed in shock as they watched the enormous skeleton island sail towards the volcano region.<br/><br/>The Skeleton Island’s actions, as well as the members of the nine swords race who were filled with killing intent standing in front of the skeleton island, quickly attracted the attention of countless people.<br/><br/>Such a gigantic skeleton island could not be hidden as it moved forward in the Milky Way.<br/><br/>In less than half an hour, the whereabouts and matters of the skeleton island were transmitted to the AI, causing a commotion.<br/><br/>“The skeleton race is going to join forces with the nine swords race to attack the Dragon Palace? This…”<br/><br/>“The nine swords race came back to attack the Dragon Palace. Didn’t they only have one venerable? Plus, the skeleton race isn’t a match for the Dragon Palace!”<br/><br/>“With their strength, they can destroy the Dragon Palace? They’re not going to attack the Dragon Palace, right?”<br/><br/>Countless people on the AI started to discuss the same thing.<br/><br/>They really didn’t believe that the nine swords race and the skeleton race were going to attack the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Even if the skeleton race was very strong, it was impossible to destroy the Dragon Palace with the strength of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“What’s going on? Nine swords have returned and are going to attack the Dragon Palace with the skeleton race? With their strength, they can’t destroy the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>At the same time, when the mist race received the news, they were slightly stunned. Venerable Red Mist and the others frowned and thought to themselves.<br/><br/>“The skeleton island is heading towards the volcano region. Even if it’s not to attack the Dragon Palace, it’s still very important. Let’s go there.”<br/><br/>They looked pensive.<br/><br/>“We know the strength of the skeleton race very well. Let’s go and take a look.”<br/><br/>Venerable Red Mist said directly.<br/><br/>Whether it was to attack the Dragon Palace or other things, they had to go and investigate.<br/><br/>As he spoke, he immediately walked outside.<br/><br/>The other venerables immediately followed.<br/><br/>The Skeleton Race’s strength was close to their misty clan’s, so they naturally had to understand what this race with their own strength wanted to do.<br/><br/>It wasn’t just the Misty clan, other low level races in the universe, and even some domain level races, after receiving this news, also immediately headed over.<br/><br/>“Left protector, it seems like a war is about to break out in the Milky Way. The skeleton race here seems to be going to attack the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>In a place within the Milky Way, two venerables from the ancient painting sect were looking for Lou Shan venerables and the others.<br/><br/>Seeing the information on the universe AI, they raised their eyebrows and said.<br/><br/>“Let’s go take a look.”<br/><br/>The two pondered for a moment and decided to go take a look.<br/><br/>They had not received any information at the last banquet. There was another possibility, and that was that the person who killed venerable Lou Shan had not arrived.<br/><br/>In the Milky Way, the only things that could destroy venerable Lou Shan and the others were the fog, the skeletons, and the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Now that the skeleton clan was suspected to be attacking the Dragon Palace, a battle would definitely break out. At that time, they would be able to investigate in more detail.<br/><br/>As the two of them spoke, they flew towards the volcanic region quickly.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, the skeleton clan will arrive here in about thirty hours.”<br/><br/>At the same time, Wang Xian and the rest had already received the news when they were traveling on the skeleton island in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Very good. are all the members of the Dragon Palace Ready?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stood up and asked with a smile on his face.<br/><br/>“All of them are ready.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui nodded.<br/><br/>“Alright, Alright. We will be waiting for them.”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, he stood up and flew out.<br/><br/>At this moment, around the Dragon Palace, a number of dragon species were training. When they swept their gaze over, none of them were weaker than the divine emperor level.<br/><br/>Now, the eyes of the members of the Dragon Defense Division who had evolved into the halberd dragon guards were filled with excitement and fervor.<br/><br/>This is their first battle.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
