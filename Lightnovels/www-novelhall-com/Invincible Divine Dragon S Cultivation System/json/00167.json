Roar! Roar!”<br/><br/>The roar was similar to a dragon’s roar, but there was a hint of desolation in it.<br/><br/>The dragon scale in the blood violence patriarch’s hand flew out and covered his body.<br/><br/>His body slowly condensed into the appearance of a divine dragon.<br/><br/>Under the cover of the Dragon Scale, it flickered with a gem-like luster.<br/><br/>He stared at Lei Ming, his eyes were filled with bloodlust and killing intent, as well as that intense heat.<br/><br/>“Hong Hong Hong!”<br/><br/>He carried a power that wasn’t weaker than a level 3 knight and directly attacked Lei Ming.<br/><br/>“With our dragon God body’s power, you think you can kill a true dragon? Dream On!”<br/><br/>Lei Ming roared, facing the dragon skeleton and the Blood Dragon, he wasn’t afraid at all, his face was filled with dignity.<br/><br/>Bolts of lightning attacked them one after another.<br/><br/>“Crack Crack Crack!”<br/><br/>The dragon skeleton swung its enormous tail and swept towards the lightning.<br/><br/>The terrifying dragon skeleton instantly caused the lightning to collapse.<br/><br/>“Destroy this lightning dragon.”<br/><br/>The dragon skeleton looked at the blood ruthless patriarch and roared loudly.<br/><br/>“Good! Kill!”<br/><br/>The blood red eyes of the blood ruthless patriarch released light.<br/><br/>His claws covered with dragon scales clawed at Lei Ming.<br/><br/>“Lightning Exorcism!”<br/><br/>Lei Ming didn’t show any weakness. He also waved his dragon claws to meet the dragon claws of the clan leader of the Blood Violence Clan.<br/><br/>He was a true divine dragon. The dragon skeleton and the blood dragon only relied on the body and scales of the divine dragon to have such strength.<br/><br/>Facing two people of the same level, he wasn’t afraid at all.<br/><br/>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>The Thunder Dragon’s Claw and the Blood Dragon’s claw collided. The blood on the blood dragon’s claw melted rapidly.<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>At this moment, another gigantic dragon claw attacked Lei Ming from the side.<br/><br/>Lei Ming’s eyes focused. The Thunder Dragon’s tail swept across swiftly and violently.<br/><br/>Bang<br/><br/>The sound of collision rang out. Lei Ming’s body retreated. It was difficult for him to gain the upper hand when facing the blood dragon and the dragon skeleton.<br/><br/>“Kill the rest of them as soon as possible and support Lei Ming.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the battle in the sky. His face was filled with coldness.<br/><br/>He did not expect the three races to have the combat strength of two universe knights at level three.<br/><br/>Although it was enhanced through a special method, the dragon skeleton and the dragon scales were all treasures from a purebred powerful divine dragon.<br/><br/>They were genuine universe treasures.<br/><br/>Such treasures were even stronger than acquired spiritual treasures.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>When the group of Dragon Palace Knights heard Wang Xian’s words, a violent aura surged from their bodies.<br/><br/>Currently, there were seven level two universe knights from the three clans. Two of them were killed, and the blood violence clan leader relied on the dragon scale to advance to level three universe knights to fight against Lei Ming. There were only four of them.<br/><br/>With the strength of the Dragon Palace, they could definitely destroy them as soon as possible.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, Your Dragon Palace will be destroyed today. Sword Spirit, come out!”<br/><br/>The clan leader of the nine-sword race was excited to see the skeleton race and the blood-red race unleash such terrifying power.<br/><br/>He roared and waved his arm. The trump card of the nine-sword race came out.<br/><br/>A ferocious and terrifying sword spirit flew out of a godly sword.<br/><br/>The form of the sword spirit was similar to that of the Divine Dragon, but it was completely different.<br/><br/>It was formed from the void and exuded a powerful murderous aura.<br/><br/>Wang Xian and the rest could vaguely sense the aura of the dragon’s blood from the sword spirit.<br/><br/>“Clan leader of the blood violence clan, get rid of that lightning dragon first. Kill the rest of the supremacies of the Dragon Palace first before dealing with that lightning dragon.”<br/><br/>The golden skeleton clan leader swept his gaze across the power of the Dragon Palace and roared loudly.<br/><br/>“Alright!”<br/><br/>The blood violence clan leader replied immediately.<br/><br/>He could also sense that the lightning dragon in front of him was extremely powerful and had rich combat experience.<br/><br/>It would be difficult to kill it in a short period of time.<br/><br/>However, he could use the dragon skeleton to entangle it and kill the rest of the experts of the Dragon Palace himself.<br/><br/>“Your opponent is me. Don’t even think about escaping!”<br/><br/>Lei Ming swept his gaze over and the Lightning on his body became violent. He immediately created a terrifying domain that enveloped the blood violence clan leader and the dragon skeleton, preventing them from going down to hunt the members of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Kill!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian saw Lei Ming using all his strength to pin down the dragon skeleton and the blood dragon. He let out a loud roar and unleashed his speed to the maximum. His gaze was fixed on the golden skeleton chief in front of him.<br/><br/>The five elements grinding mill spun and similarly pressed down on the golden skeleton chief.<br/><br/>The terrifying speed and power caused the expression of the golden skeleton chief to change drastically.<br/><br/>“Defend! Defend!”<br/><br/>The golden skeleton chief roared loudly.<br/><br/>As long as the dragon skeleton or the blood ruthless patriarch got rid of the Lightning Dragon, victory would belong to them.<br/><br/>The purebred divine dragon bloodline would belong to them.<br/><br/>“Array formation, RISE!”<br/><br/>At this moment, a voice came from the mouth of the sky array. The raindrops that were already raining suddenly became even more urgent.<br/><br/>The raindrops seemed to contain a powerful interference force.<br/><br/>“Start the array!”<br/><br/>The Ten Thousand Dragon Wizards also roared.<br/><br/>The more urgent raindrops covered the entire battlefield and the skeleton island in front of them.<br/><br/>“HMM?”<br/><br/>“There are many powerful array masters in the Dragon Palace. They knew that the skeleton race would invade in advance, so they set up the array. However, this array seems to be a trap array to prevent the enemy from escaping. They are really confident.”<br/><br/>Red Fog Knight, who was watching the battle from the surrounding, sensed the surrounding water droplets and said.<br/><br/>The area covered by this water droplet was extremely terrifying. Even their side was covered.<br/><br/>Within the area covered by this water droplet, even he could not directly escape back to his Cosmos God nation.<br/><br/>Only a tier three universe knight could break through the defense of the water droplet.<br/><br/>“All Disciples of the Dragon Palace, kill them!”<br/><br/>The array was activated and wasn’t obstructed at all. The skeletons of the skeleton island, the disciples of the nine swords race, and the Warriors of the bloodthirsty race, the armies of the three races were still attacking madly. Prime Minister Gui gave an order.<br/><br/>The trump cards of the skeleton race and the nine swords race had been blocked by the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Then it was time for the Dragon Palace to reveal its trump cards.<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui’s order was a signal.<br/><br/>Ten figures flew towards the battlefield at a terrifying speed in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>At this time, the Imperial Dragon of the Dragon Palace and the berserk dragon of the Dragon Palace were at the forefront of the battlefield.<br/><br/>A million devouring dragons were at the left and right sides.<br/><br/>The Starwood Dragon, Halberd Dragon Guard, Venom dragon, and other dragon species followed closely behind.<br/><br/>The supporting voices of the Dolphin clan filled the battlefield.<br/><br/>A terrifying war broke out.<br/><br/>Even the Dragon Palace lost hundreds of its members in a short period of time.<br/><br/>However, compared to the losses of the Dragon Palace, the deaths of the three clans were even more terrifying.<br/><br/>More than two billion skeletons from the skeleton clan were destroyed.<br/><br/>More than ten thousand experts from the nine-sword clan and the bloodthirsty clan were also killed.<br/><br/>It was hard to say who would win.<br/><br/>However, when the ten members of the Dragon Palace flew out, they were accompanied by terrifying energy.<br/><br/>“Soaring Dragon Arrow, destroy!”<br/><br/>“Berserk Dragon Leaf, kill!”<br/><br/>“Dragon Sword, Return!”<br/><br/>“Imperial Dragon Regretful Land!”<br/><br/>“Poison, Corrode!”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
