This speed has at least doubled!”<br/><br/>In the blood plasma land, Wang Xian stood at the bottom. The roots of the ancestral tree were rooted there.<br/><br/>Wang Xian sensed the speed of condensing the blood refinement fruit and a smile appeared on his face!<br/><br/>He could condense four blood refinement fruits in a year. If he wanted to condense four million blood refinement fruits, he would probably need 10,000 years.<br/><br/>10,000 years was neither too long nor too short!<br/><br/>“The stronger I am, the more I feel that the ancestral tree is abnormal. I am starting to suspect that the Divine Dragon clan and the insect clan died together because they were fighting for this blood refinement fruit.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian mumbled as a smile appeared on his face!<br/><br/>The ancestral tree was abnormal. It was so abnormal that it was terrifying!<br/><br/>Even if an ordinary powerhouse had the ancestral tree, as long as he didn’t die, he would be able to establish a peak race.<br/><br/>This was an existence at the Heavenly Yuan creation level.<br/><br/>Time passed quickly. After 300 divine dragons inspected the various races, the power of the Dragon Palace spread throughout the universe.<br/><br/>In the universe, many people with the Divine Dragon bloodline were freed.<br/><br/>No force dared to kill someone with the Divine Dragon bloodline for no reason!<br/><br/>The Divine Dragon bloodline also rose up completely!<br/><br/>The heaven opening desolate continent also regained its peace.<br/><br/>The blood-refining fruits condensed one after another, giving birth to many purebred divine dragons in the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, we are about to break through!”<br/><br/>Eight years later, just as Wang Xian was bored and was deducing the means of attack, a message was suddenly sent to him.<br/><br/>This was a message from Wu Sha. When he saw this message, he was slightly stunned.<br/><br/>His body moved and he returned to the Dragon Palace directly!<br/><br/>“Is he going to break through?”<br/><br/>In the Dragon Field of the Dragon Palace, Wu Sha, water demon, demon wing, Shi Sen, Ming Sha Sheng, Thunder Flash, and Sky Shrouding stood in the center!<br/><br/>Prime Minister Turtle and all the disciples with the Combat Power of universe masters of the Dragon Palace arrived.<br/><br/>For the Great Beings of the pinnacle races, breaking through from a universe knight to a universe master was a transformation.<br/><br/>It was also a calamity.<br/><br/>For the core disciples of the peak races, they could cultivate to the peak level of a universe knight without any restrictions.<br/><br/>However, it was very difficult to break through from the peak level of a universe knight to a universe master.<br/><br/>Many powerhouses of the peak races could not break through in their entire lives.<br/><br/>Wu Sha and Ming Sha were all powerhouses of the peak races. They all had the inheritance of the peak races.<br/><br/>Before they met Wang Xian, they had no chance of breaking through either.<br/><br/>For the powerhouses from the peak races, it was a qualitative improvement for a supremacy to advance to a ruler.<br/><br/>Similarly, this improvement would be a disaster for all the powerful disciples of the Dragon Palace in the future.<br/><br/>Using resources would not be able to create a ruler of the universe.<br/><br/>The powerful disciples of the Dragon Palace also needed to comprehend and cultivate on their own.<br/><br/>The breakthrough of Wu Sha and the rest this time was quite an experience for the powerful ones of the Dragon Palace to achieve breakthroughs in the future.<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>All the disciples of the Dragon Palace immediately greeted respectfully when they saw Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Wu Sha, you guys have a breakthrough first!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian waved his hand and said to them with a smile.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>Wu Sha and the rest nodded their heads. Their faces were filled with excitement!<br/><br/>The seven of them looked at each other.<br/><br/>“Let’s break through together!”<br/><br/>“Haha, I’ve Been Waiting for more than 10 billion years this time, more than 10 billion years!”<br/><br/>“Haha, I’ve Been Waiting for more than 5 billion years too!”<br/><br/>The excited voice came from the mouth of the Dark Killer Wu Sha and the others.<br/><br/>They had been trapped in the Pinnacle Universe Knight realm for too long!<br/><br/>Boom! Boom! Boom<br/><br/>As they spoke, waves of power soared into the sky!<br/><br/>This majestic and terrifying aura caused the expressions of the surrounding disciples of the Dragon Palace to change slightly.<br/><br/>Even bei Shuang could only withstand it because of the circulation of the surrounding frost.<br/><br/>“Their breakthrough is a forceful breakthrough with great power. This method is not representative. You guys just need to comprehend it. Don’t use it as a reference for the future.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the group of five kills who had achieved a breakthrough and reminded the disciples of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>Wu Sha and the rest of the seven people’s breakthrough method was to use force to achieve a breakthrough. They had to build up their strength to complete the breakthrough.<br/><br/>This method was not advisable.<br/><br/>In the entire universe, there was no one who could achieve such combat strength at the level of a universe knight other than the Mad Demon from the Invincible Zone.<br/><br/>The group of disciples nodded their heads and looked at Wu Sha and the rest in the Dragon Field!<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!”<br/><br/>At this moment, waves of terrifying and vast energy were transmitted from Wu Sha and the rest.<br/><br/>The vast energy carried a trace of the aura of the universe and belonged to their respective attributes. It surged into their bodies like mad demons.<br/><br/>Their bodies began to undergo qualitative changes.<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked over and his eyes were filled with curiosity.<br/><br/>All kinds of attributes seemed to have come to life. They surged into their bodies and underwent transformation and strengthening from the inside out.<br/><br/>It was fortunate that the Dragon Palace’s current level was relatively high and could completely block the power of their breakthrough.<br/><br/>Otherwise, with the commotion of their breakthrough, it would cause a huge change in the world. It was likely that everyone within a radius of a few hundred billion kilometers would be able to sense it.<br/><br/>Even so, the vast scene of their breakthrough shocked all the experts of the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The energy entered the body and slowly turned into a sphere. It seemed to be a world inside the sphere.<br/><br/>The energy and shape of the world evolved as if a universe had been formed.<br/><br/>Each person’s sphere had a different scene.<br/><br/>Inside Wu Sha’s sphere, there was darkness and a blurry figure flashing.<br/><br/>Inside the demonic wings sphere, a huge demonic beast was born. Gradually, it spread its wings that covered the sky.<br/><br/>Inside the lightning-like sphere, it was like a world of thunder. A light spot was shuttling back and forth continuously.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>All the disciples of the Dragon Palace stared at the various strange phenomena.<br/><br/>These strange phenomena could give them great inspiration.<br/><br/>Wang Xian watched quietly. The energy in the sphere had completed its evolution. Finally, the figures of Wu Sha and the rest appeared.<br/><br/>At this moment, the aura on their bodies had clearly undergone a change.<br/><br/>They seemed to be more compatible with the entire universe. The Aura on their bodies was also more elegant.<br/><br/>There was no pressure on their bodies, but there was a sense of majesty. This majesty even made some weak people afraid to look at them directly.<br/><br/>This was a leap in the level of life.<br/><br/>“Not bad!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them. He smiled and nodded his head.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, we have made a breakthrough!”<br/><br/>Wu Sha and the rest said excitedly to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>“Yes, that’s fine. All of you should stabilize your strength in the Dragon Palace first. Don’t leave the Dragon Palace for the time being.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian smiled and instructed them.<br/><br/>Wu Sha and the rest had made a breakthrough. This meant that the Dragon Palace could be promoted to a peak race.<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian was not planning to announce it at the moment, nor was he planning to promote to a peak race.<br/><br/>He wanted to announce the ascension of the Dragon Palace when there were at least dozens of masters of the universe in the Dragon Palace.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
