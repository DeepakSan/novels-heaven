Didn’t they say that the supreme water demon king and the other two old monsters of the invincible region are not weaker than the true universe overlords? How could they be killed by the Dragon Palace? And how long has it only been?”<br/><br/>“No way! What… What happened in the Heavenly River? If the Dragon Palace didn’t announce that they were going to hold an auction, I wouldn’t have believed it!”<br/><br/>“This dragon palace is simply heaven-defying. Some of the strong disciples in the Heavenly River said that the Dragon Palace destroyed all the experts of the Monster King and the others within ten minutes. The weakest one is a universe dominator with level 3 battle strength.
