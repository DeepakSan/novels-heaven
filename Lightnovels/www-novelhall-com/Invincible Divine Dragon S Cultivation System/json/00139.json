The most important thing was that the Dragon Palace had an additional peak dragon species. The Yaksha from the dragon protection division could also evolve into a halberd dragon guard.<br/><br/>The dragon protection division and Ao Yaksha had followed Wang Xian all the way from Earth. However, they were currently at the bottom of the entire Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>As an important army of the Dragon Palace, ao Yecha and the rest also urgently needed to evolve into powerful dragon species.<br/><br/>The Halberd Dragon Guard was the best choice.<br/><br/>“Thank you, Dragon King! Thank you, Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The Heavenly Halberd Dragon horse bowed to Wang Xian excitedly.<br/><br/>“In the future when you join the Dragon Palace, you don’t have to kneel to anyone except for the Dragon King and Dragon Queen. No one can make you kneel.”<br/><br/>“We are the Divine Dragon Clan, an existence at the peak of the universe.”<br/><br/>Prime Minister Gui said to the Heavenly Halberd dragon horse from the side.<br/><br/>“Yes, yes!”<br/><br/>The Heavenly Halberd Dragon horse nodded heavily.<br/><br/>“Let’s go. Call ao Yecha and the rest over.”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, he brought the Heavenly Halberd Dragon horse into the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>With the bloodline of the Heavenly Halberd Dragon horse, he could easily pass through the Dragon Gate. Wang Xian immediately brought him to the dragon transformation pool.<br/><br/>There wasn’t much dragon blood in the dragon transformation pool at the moment, but there was the corpse of Venerable Lou Shan.<br/><br/>His corpse was enough for the Dragon Palace to produce a few universe knight level members.<br/><br/>“Dragon King, does the Dragon Palace have a powerful dragon seed that we can change jobs with?”<br/><br/>At this moment, ao Yecha and all the members of the Dragon Defense Department flew over with excited expressions on their faces.<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded with a smile on his face. His gaze signaled to the Heaven Halberd dragon horse at the side.<br/><br/>“Enter the dragon transformation pool and begin your cultivation. With the Majestic Dragon Blood, the bloodline in the deeper parts of your body will be activated.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian ordered the Heaven Halberd Dragon horse.<br/><br/>“It’s the Dragon King. I, the Heaven Halberd, will never forget the favor of the Dragon King!”<br/><br/>The Heaven Halberd Dragon horse kowtowed to Wang Xian and flew into the dragon transformation pool without any hesitation.<br/><br/>He looked on with a smile on his face.<br/><br/>Ao Yecha and the rest were also waiting excitedly at the side.<br/><br/>Just as the Heaven Halberd Dragon horse entered the dragon transformation pool to evolve.<br/><br/>In an ancient painting sect tens of thousands of light years away, the life tokens of the deputy sect leader and the rest were shattered, causing a huge commotion.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“The location of the Dragon Palace has been locked. I think we can start probing.”<br/><br/>At the same time, on a luxurious ship in the Milky Way Sea, a group of people sat on both sides.<br/><br/>In front of them was the scene of the Underwater Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>“I think this is a good thing for us. Didn’t the Dragon Palace say that they would recruit all the Yalong Disciples? Didn’t they say that they would protect them?”<br/><br/>“As the Divine Dragon Bloodline, there are definitely many Yalong who will seek refuge with them. As long as we guard the surrounding positions, we can test the strength of the Dragon Palace and capture some yalong mounts.”<br/><br/>“Hehe!”<br/><br/>The leader of the nine blade race said with a smile.<br/><br/>“That’s right, according to the information we got, the Dragon Palace shouldn’t be very strong. The only change is, does the Dragon Palace still have a Knight Level Battle Angel?”<br/><br/>“After all, Crescent Knight was a pinnacle warrior on our side, a level 3 universe Knight.”<br/><br/>The elder on the right nodded.<br/><br/>Both of them were universe knights.<br/><br/>To deal with the Dragon Palace and get some information, the two races went all out.<br/><br/>And for this operation, each race sent out three universe knights.<br/><br/>This power was definitely terrifying.<br/><br/>“There should be very few battle angels at the Knight Level.”<br/><br/>An old man from the nine blade race guessed.<br/><br/>“We’ll know how many there are soon. Let’s play with them.”<br/><br/>The Knights of the two races looked at each other, their eyes filled with coldness.<br/><br/>The two races had decided that they wouldn’t stop until the Dragon Palace was destroyed.<br/><br/>“Hide in the surroundings. Once the Yalong enters the volcano region, capture it immediately.”<br/><br/>The two races gave the order, and the luxurious ship slowly hid in the ocean.<br/><br/>“Go, go, as long as we join the Dragon Palace, we will be able to receive the protection of the Dragon Palace.”<br/><br/>Time passed day by day, and the Dragon Palace officially stepped onto the stage of the Milky Way.<br/><br/>And the information of the Dragon Palace on the universe ai also attracted the attention of many Asian Dragons.<br/><br/>When they saw this news, some of their eyes revealed excitement.<br/><br/>The Yalong would be captured and used as a mount or killed to extract the pure dragon blood once they were discovered.<br/><br/>They couldn’t protect themselves.<br/><br/>There was a powerful divine dragon faction in the Milky Way, and many of the Yalong had decided to join them.<br/><br/>The Milky Way was very big, and even if the number of Yalong was small, there were at least a few thousand of them.<br/><br/>Some of the Yalong flew towards the Milky Way volcano region.<br/><br/>However, before they reached the volcano region, they were noticed by some people.<br/><br/>The nine sword race and the dragon race. It was very easy for them to monitor an area.<br/><br/>The experts of the two races took action. Some of the Yalong were suppressed before they reached the volcano region.<br/><br/>However, although these yalong were suppressed, they did not attract any attention and no one noticed.<br/><br/>“Let’s go, Sister. The Dragon Palace’s territory is ahead. As long as we join the Dragon Palace, we won’t have to be afraid anymore today.”<br/><br/>Half a month later, a man and a woman shuttled through the ocean of the Milky Way.<br/><br/>The man and woman had human bodies, but they had dragon horns, which made them look more majestic.<br/><br/>Their eyes were full of vigilance.<br/><br/>“Okay, Brother.”<br/><br/>A young voice sounded from the side as they looked around in panic.<br/><br/>They were very weak. The woman had not even reached the divine emperor realm, while the young man was only at the first level of the divine emperor realm.<br/><br/>“Fortunately, the powerful desolate beasts in the surrounding sea area have been cleaned up by the Dragon Palace. Otherwise, we might not have been able to reach here.”<br/><br/>The young man said in a low voice as he quickly flew forward with his sister.<br/><br/>“Weng Weng!”<br/><br/>However, suddenly, the dragon horn on the young man’s head emitted a bright light as it continuously trembled.<br/><br/>“Not good!”<br/><br/>The young man’s expression changed greatly. He hurriedly grabbed his younger sister’s arm and roared, “Flee, flee immediately.”<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/><br/>The girl’s face instantly turned pale. She did not dare to stay any longer and her figure became illusory.<br/><br/>The young man at the side also immediately wanted to return to his divine kingdom.<br/><br/>However, when a figure appeared in front of him, and a powerful aura swept over, his expression changed drastically. He quickly stopped and formed a defense in front of him, not allowing this power to interrupt his sister’s escape.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
