If you are lucky, you will be able to absorb the soul fragments of the powerhouses here. Your Luck is not bad.<br/><br/>It’s even comparable to obtaining some sword alms and magic alms inheritance!”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke to them!<br/><br/>“Yes, yes. Thank you, brother Wang Xian! ”<br/><br/>Long Yin Yin nodded her head heavily. A happy expression appeared on her face!<br/><br/>“Brother Wang Xian! ”<br/><br/>At this moment, a voice came from a spot not far away.<br/><br/>Following that, Wang Xian saw more than ten figures flying towards him.<br/><br/>The leader was a woman. She was covered in flowing water and had a comfortable smile on her face.<br/><br/>Beside her was another young man covered in flowing water.<br/><br/>Both of them exuded a powerful and noble aura.<br/><br/>They flew over and their eyes landed on Wang Xian!<br/><br/>“This is really amazing. I didn ‘t expect brother Wang Xian to have achieved a breakthrough in your strength. ”<br/><br/>The one who spoke was the Saintess of the flowing water forbidden ground, Saintess flowing moon. She looked at Wang Xian with a hint of shock in her eyes.<br/><br/>As the Saintess of the flowing water forbidden ground, they possessed a large number of treasures.<br/><br/>Naturally, they also had a lot of treasures for scouting!<br/><br/>Naturally, they could sense that Wang Xian’s strength had already broken through!<br/><br/>After breaking through, Wang Xian would have the same level of combat strength as them.<br/><br/>Although they didn ‘t think that Wang Xian would be their match, it wouldn’t be that easy for them to kill Wang Xian.<br/><br/>Furthermore, he had obtained the corpse of the inheritance of a top spatial master from the previous calamity!<br/><br/>“Hehe, I was just lucky! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the people in the flowing water forbidden ground and landed on Saintess Liu Yue. He smiled faintly.<br/><br/>“This isn’t something that can be done by luck. ”<br/><br/>Saintess Liu Yue looked at Wang Xian and glanced at the dragon roar, Yin Long Yin Hao, and the rest. She said directly, “Saint Wang Xian, to tell you the truth, we have a favor to ask of you! ”<br/><br/>“Oh? Please tell us, Saint Flowing Moon.”<br/><br/>Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at them curiously.<br/><br/>“We have a method in the flowing water forbidden land. We can use one person as the core to transfer and evenly spread any damage.”<br/><br/>The flowing moon Saintess said, “We used this method to transfer the impact of the will on the demon pillar. However, one of our junior brothers who was the core died instantly. He didn’t even last a minute! ”<br/><br/>“This is because we have already transferred dozens of portions of the impact of the will on the demon pillar. With our willpower and mental strength, we can’t withstand this impact at all. It’s hard to imagine how you managed to succeed, Saint Wang Xian!”<br/><br/>As she spoke, she suddenly stopped!<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at her and smiled, indicating for her to continue.<br/><br/>“To break the demon pillar, we need experts of the same attribute to inject their energy into the demon pillar. However, it’s not necessary to withstand the impact of the will. Our method is very safe. Of course, the prerequisite is to be able to withstand the impact of the will! ”<br/><br/>“We would like to ask Saint Wang Xian for help. We will use this method to break the demon pillar. ”<br/><br/>Saintess Liuyue continued!<br/><br/>After Wang Xian obtained one of the demon pillars, they had thought of ways to break through the flowing water forbidden land and obtain the recognition of the corpses of the experts inside.<br/><br/>However, they had never succeeded!<br/><br/>They had even lost a junior brother who was at level three of the Universe Dominator!<br/><br/>Based on the time that this junior brother had died, they concluded that even if their strength could be upgraded by another level, they would not be able to withstand the impact of this willpower.<br/><br/>This shocked them immensely. They could not understand how Wang Xian could withstand the impact of this willpower?<br/><br/>“You want to use me as the core and I will bear most of the impact of the willpower. However, you should obtain the approval of the corpses of the powerhouses in the Magic Pillar! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at the Saintess of the flowing water forbidden ground and asked directly.<br/><br/>“Yes. This method of our flowing water forbidden ground can help brother Wang Xian share some of the impact of the will. Of course, this sharing is only our limit. You have to bear most of the impact of the will yourself, brother<br/><br/>Wang Xian. ”<br/><br/>“Of course. Since you can bear the impact of the will of the space magic pillar alone, you must be able to bear the impact of the other magic pillars as well.<br/><br/>After all, the powerhouses who are at the peak of the dominance of the space attribute are acknowledged to be the strongest! ”<br/><br/>The flowing moon Saintess said, “Of course, our flowing water forbidden ground will not let you help us for nothing. You can name your conditions and we will try our best to fulfill them!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian heard her words, his eyes flickered slightly. He glanced at the magic pillars one by one.<br/><br/>“Yes, yes. I want two water attribute magic pillars! ”<br/><br/>He hesitated for more than ten seconds, he said directly, “Two water attribute magic pillars. In addition, since we are going to open the magic pillars, we might as well open all of them. Your flowing water forbidden ground should contact the undeserved forbidden ground and the other disciples of the forbidden ground to discuss it together! ”<br/><br/>“Other than the two water elemental magic pillars, other than the corpses of the strong ones, I want to choose the two items on his body first! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian stated his conditions directly!<br/><br/>Since the flowing water forbidden ground had this spell, Wang Xian could open all the magic pillars!<br/><br/>After opening them, he didn’t care about the corpses of the strong ones because they weren’t of much use to him!<br/><br/>However, Wang Xian couldn’t miss out on some of the treasures that these strong practitioners possessed.<br/><br/>In addition, he wanted the corpses of two water-attributed strong practitioners to give to long yinyin and long yinhao.<br/><br/>He had been with them for tens of millions of years and had many friendships. He wanted to give them an opportunity!<br/><br/>“Two water-attributed corpses. Brother Wang Xian, don’t you want too many of them?”<br/><br/>Before the flowing moon Saintess could reply, the other saint son from the flowing water forbidden ground had a drastic change in expression. He immediately spoke up.<br/><br/>There were three water-type magic pillars in the entire second level. Once Wang Xian wanted two of them, the third one would definitely belong to the flowing moon Saintess.<br/><br/>Then, he wouldn’t have any gains!<br/><br/>This was unacceptable to him!<br/><br/>“Brother Wang Xian, if there are two water-type corpses, I can give you one! ” The flowing moon Saintess also frowned slightly as she spoke.<br/><br/>“It’s not much. You can consider it. If you are willing to help, I will help. The rest of the magic pillars are useless to you. However, you can make a trade with the unfettered forbidden land. I believe that the value of your trade will definitely be more than my gains. ”<br/><br/>“Oh, that’s right. I know the Holy Sons of the Void Dragon Holy Land. I will make a trade with them for the metal attribute magic pillars. In other words, I want three magic pillars and two treasures for each powerhouse. ”<br/><br/>“Overall, it’s still your flowing water forbidden land. You guys have gained a<br/><br/>huge advantage! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
