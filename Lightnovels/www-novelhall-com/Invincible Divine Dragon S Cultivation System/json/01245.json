Buzz! Buzz<br/><br/>At the teleportation formation that invaded the evil sequence of the mountain universe.<br/><br/>Along with Wang Xian killing two powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin realm.<br/><br/>200,000 powerhouses in the Dominator realm.<br/><br/>The top-notch powerhouses among the intruders from the mountain universe also quickly came over to check the situation through the teleportation formation.<br/><br/>Two figures walked out from the teleportation formation. Their entire bodies were shrouded in powerful energy to prevent them from being ambushed suddenly!<br/><br/>“Damn it, is that guy the one who ambushed our blood Naga Universe?”<br/><br/>“The powerhouses from the mountain range universe? Impossible, they can’t do it with their strength! ”<br/><br/>The two controlling-level powerhouses from the Blood Naga universe scanned their surroundings with an ugly expression on their faces.<br/><br/>However, their eyes suddenly focused and saw Wang Xian in front of them.<br/><br/>“Are there only two control-level powerhouses here?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian looked at them and said calmly!<br/><br/>“It’s You! ”<br/><br/>Two heaven origin creation-level powerhouses from the Blood Naga universe, one of whom was like a crocodile, stared at Wang Xian and growled in a low voice with a face full of fear!<br/><br/>“Are you the one who launched a sneak attack on our blood Naga Universe?”<br/><br/>The other heaven origin creation-level powerhouse also stared at Wang Xian coldly!<br/><br/>Boom<br/><br/>However, what responded to them was Wang Xian’s terrifying attack!<br/><br/>He channeled all the energy in his body, nine attributes, and the power of space to attack them directly!<br/><br/>“Not good!”<br/><br/>“Dodge!”<br/><br/>When Wang Xian ‘s energy attacked them.<br/><br/>The faces of the two control-level Tianyuan creator-level powerhouses changed drastically as they roared in horror!<br/><br/>Through this beam of energy, they immediately deduced that Wang Xian was an existence at the Great Dao level.<br/><br/>Moreover, only an existence at the Great Dao level could kill two beginner-level powerhouses in their blood Naga universe at such a terrifying speed.<br/><br/>The two controlling-level powerhouses hurriedly tried to fend off Wang Xian’s attack.<br/><br/>Their bodies were sent flying very far away and they barely managed to fend off Wang Xian’s attack.<br/><br/>The two powerhouses stared at Wang Xian with an embarrassed expression. (‘I will guard this universe. Get out of here within five years. Otherwise! ”<br/><br/>As Wang Xian spoke, he narrowed his eyes slightly and swept his gaze across them with a ghastly expression.<br/><br/>Following that, Wang Xian ignored them. His figure moved and he left immediately!<br/><br/>He didn’t say anything else.<br/><br/>If this fellow from the bloody Naga universe still didn’t give up, Wang Xian would make a move.<br/><br/>At that time, he could even consider calling the queen of floating water, Tianci, Linniu, and Hundun over.<br/><br/>At that time, he would be able to obtain a huge amount of resources by killing a large number of people from the evil sequence faction.<br/><br/>This time, Wang Xian made his move and directly obtained two corpses of Heaven origin creation realm powerhouses and 200,000 overlord-level corpses.<br/><br/>There were also hundreds of thousands of supremacy-level corpses.<br/><br/>This was a huge harvest.<br/><br/>This would allow the disciples of the Dragon Palace to improve tremendously.<br/><br/>Putting everything aside, it would not be a problem for the Dragon Palace to increase the number of the peak of the ruler level.<br/><br/>Killing the creatures in the Blood Naga universe would also benefit the Dragon Palace greatly!<br/><br/>“Damn it! ”<br/><br/>The two Heaven’s origin creator powerhouses of the Blood Naga looked extremely embarrassed when they saw Wang Xian leaving.<br/><br/>They kept changing their expressions as they flew straight into the teleportation formation.<br/><br/>The reason why the Blood Naga universe invaded the mountain range universe was because there were no powerful heaven origin destiny realm existences in the mountain range universe.<br/><br/>Furthermore, they were in the early stages of the calamity. If they invaded the mountain range universe, it would be too late for the mountain range universe to seek help from the powerful existences of the justice sequence faction!<br/><br/>By the time their reinforcements arrived, they had already completely occupied this place.<br/><br/>Now, the mountain universe actually had an extra great dao level heavenly Yuan creation realm expert.<br/><br/>They had killed two of their heavenly yuan creation realm experts.<br/><br/>This was a very heavy blow to the Blood Naga universe!<br/><br/>Most importantly, the mountain universe had a great dao level existence guarding it, so it was impossible for them to break through!<br/><br/>“This… This Lord Dragon King is so powerful. He directly warned them about the blood Naga universe!”<br/><br/>“He killed two beginner-level heavenly yuan creation realm existences with such power and now he’s warning them. The Blood Naga universe shouldn’t dare to continue invading us! ”<br/><br/>“With this Lord Dragon King here, the crisis of our mountain universe can be easily overcome! ”<br/><br/>“Great, Great! ”<br/><br/>At the same time, the Heaven’s origin creator of the mountain range universe, who saw everything through the heavenly copper mirror, looked extremely excited when they saw this scene!<br/><br/>The crisis in the mountain range universe was about to be resolved.<br/><br/>With this Dragon King here, the other party wouldn’t be able to conquer their universe at all.<br/><br/>Moreover, if the Dragon King led them to launch a counterattack, they would still have some advantages!<br/><br/>“Greetings, Dragon King. Thank you for resolving the crisis in our mountain range universe!”<br/><br/>After a long while, the four Heaven’s origin creation stage powerhouses saw Wang Xian returning. They immediately flew out and greeted him respectfully. Their faces were filled with excitement as they thanked him!<br/><br/>“There’s no need. This is our deal, and it’s what I should do! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head nonchalantly and looked at them. “Currently, the Army of the Blood Naga universe has not left yet. However, there’s no need to worry. If they don’t leave within five years, I will continue to attack. ” “Now, I want to let a disciple of my universe make a breakthrough. ”<br/><br/>“Alright, Lord Dragon King. Although Lord Dragon King has made a deal with us, you are still the benefactor of our mountain range universe. Without You, who knows how many living beings in our mountain range universe will be killed! ”<br/><br/>At the center of the mountain range universe, the Heaven’s origin creator said with a heavy tone!<br/><br/>Wang Xian shook his head. With a wave of his arm, huming mountain appeared in front of him!<br/><br/>“Greetings, Lord Dragon King! ”<br/><br/>Huming mountain appeared and immediately bowed respectfully to Wang Xian.<br/><br/>At the same time, he was a little nervous.<br/><br/>With the changes in the situation in the mountain range universe, it was unknown whether he could break through to the realm of the Heaven’s origin universe!<br/><br/>However, very soon, he sensed that there were powerful existences around him.<br/><br/>The place he was at had also arrived at the center of the mountain range universe.<br/><br/>This? ?<br/><br/>He was slightly surprised!<br/><br/>(‘I have made a deal with the mountain range universe. Mingshan, break through! ”<br/><br/>Wang Xian spoke to huming mountain!<br/><br/>When huming mountain heard this, his body trembled slightly. He raised his head and looked at Wang Xian. “Dragon King… you… you mean I can break through now?”<br/><br/>Wang Xian nodded at him.<br/><br/>Hu Mingshan looked at the four heaven origin creation stage powerhouses in the surrounding mountain range and universe, then looked at Wang Xian, he took a deep breath and said, “I, Hu Mingshan, will always remember the favor of the Dragon King. I, the Divine Tiger clan, will always remember it. If the Dragon King has any orders in the future, I, Hu Mingshan, will not hesitate to go through fire and water! ”<br/><br/>Hu Mingshan made his promise.<br/><br/>His heart was full of gratitude.<br/><br/>No matter what, doing business with the mountain universe required something!<br/><br/>The Dragon King was the guardian of the path in this calamity, not to help them find and solve the problem of the quota.<br/><br/>The Dragon King had no obligation to do so.<br/><br/>Moreover, the Tiger Mountain was the Divine Tiger clan and had an ordinary relationship with the Dragon Palace.<br/><br/>The Dragon King was grateful for being able to do this, but at the same time, he also needed to express his attitude!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
