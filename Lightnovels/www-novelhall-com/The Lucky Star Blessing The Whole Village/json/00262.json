Usually, when checking the vegetables, only two lights would be turned on, but now all the street lights were on, making the dark night very bright.<br/><br/>At 00:00, all the villagers, including children and even those with limited mobility, gathered in the fields, standing on the edge of the first piece of land to be harvested. The light from the streetlights cast long shadows of them, making them seem excited and agitated.<br/><br/>Some people held firecrackers in their hands, some held fireworks, and even the elders had gongs and drums, just short of having a suona horn.<br/><br/>When Jiang Xile arrived with the Xiao Family, he was slightly surprised to see what everyone was holding.<br/><br/>So, the so-called harvest ceremony was all about setting off firecrackers, banging gongs, and playing drums?<br/><br/>The villagers all knew that Jiang Xile was a guest of the Xiao Wanshan family, so they greeted him with curiosity and enthusiasm.<br/><br/>“Young man, you’re here too?”<br/><br/>“You came too, lad?”<br/><br/>“Young one, are you from the Capital City?”<br/><br/>Everyone was friendly, and Jiang Xile responded to each of them, thinking to himself, “The people in this village are indeed simple and enthusiastic.”<br/><br/>Jiang Xile was an outgoing and articulate person, so he quickly struck up a conversation with the young people in the village. He had a sweet tongue, which made him popular with the elders as well. Through their conversations, he learned various legendary stories about Xiao Jinli in the village.<br/><br/>“Jinli, she could speak fluently when she was just three months old.”<br/><br/>“At six months old, she could read, and by three, she could recite the dictionary and hundreds of Tang and Song Dynasty poems.”<br/><br/>“When she was four years old…”<br/><br/>“Moreover, last year, it was because of Jinli’s intelligence and decisiveness that Xiao Chunhua’s life was saved and she escaped her miserable fate.”<br/><br/>“The vegetables planted in our village now also benefit greatly from the earthworms bred by Jinli.”<br/><br/>Jiang Xile was shocked by all the various things Xiao Jinli had done in Xiao Family Village.<br/><br/>No wonder everyone in the village loved and trusted her so much.<br/><br/>As the villagers said, Xiao Jinli was like the treasure of fortune for the whole village; it seemed that as long as she was there, the biggest troubles could be easily solved.<br/><br/>So, as long as Xiao Jinli was in the village, everyone would be more at ease, as if she were a calming pill for them.<br/><br/>This time, the first harvest and sale of the village’s vegetables was a big event for the villagers, and they naturally wanted Xiao Jinli to be present to feel more at ease.<br/><br/>Therefore, even though everyone was anxious, they still waited for Xiao Jinli to arrive.<br/><br/>However, Jiang Xile also knew that the villagers were unaware of Xiao Jinli’s medical skills.<br/><br/>“We didn’t know Jinli could practice medicine. Usually, she doesn’t like to show off, so if we have a headache or fever, we just go to the clinic or hospital, take some medicine, and get an injection.”<br/><br/>“It’s great that Jinli can practice medicine. She must be a highly skilled doctor, especially since she’s learning from the National Doctor!”<br/><br/>“As expected, Jinli always learns the best!”<br/><br/>Each villager who knew about Xiao Jinli’s medical skills was genuinely happy for her, and none was upset because she had kept it a secret!<br/><br/>Jiang Xile truly felt that the villagers were kind-hearted and genuinely happy for Xiao Jinli.<br/><br/>Before they knew it, 00:30 arrived!<br/><br/>The Village Head shouted through a loudspeaker, “Time’s up!”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
