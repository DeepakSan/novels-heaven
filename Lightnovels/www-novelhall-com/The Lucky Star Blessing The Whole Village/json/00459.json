Hearing the news, various media outlets rushed to the scene to grab the important news at the first chance.<br/><br/>Big shots from the business world racked their brains to get an admission ticket, wanting to sign an order on the spot.<br/><br/>Who in the world didn’t know that when Godsend Technology Group made a move, it was bound to be astonishing, especially when a new product appeared, it was likely to subvert one’s understanding.<br/><br/>At the press conference site of Godsend Technology Group, it was crowded and lively even though the number of people was limited.<br/><br/>“What kind of new product is Godsend Technology Group releasing this time? I’m really looking forward to it!”<br/><br/>“Every new product from Godsend Technology Group is always astonishing, and this time it will definitely be no exception.”<br/><br/>“Before the new product is released, those big shots in the business world are getting ready to compete for the first order.”<br/><br/>“Godsend Technology Group products are extraordinary. Getting an order is like getting a lucrative business. Who wouldn’t want such a business? After all, no one dislikes more money.”<br/><br/>“I’m so looking forward to it and so excited!”<br/><br/>At the conference entrance, a fully recovered Liang Haohan brought his son to attend Godsend Technology Group’s exhibition and was determined to get an order.<br/><br/>“Sorry, Mr. Liang, the company’s upper management has ordered that the Liang’s group and related personnel are refused entry to the exhibition!”<br/><br/>Upon hearing this, Liang Haohan’s face darkened. He frowned and said unhappily, “Why are we being refused entry? Whose order from the company’s upper management is this?”<br/><br/>He had gone through great lengths to get a ticket, only to be refused entry, and it was just his Liang’s group that was being refused.<br/><br/>“I have an admission ticket, but you refuse my entry. I can complain to your management, do you know that?”<br/><br/>The ticket inspector still said, “I’m sorry, Mr. Liang, this is an order from our management. Please don’t make it difficult for us!”<br/><br/>The surrounding people immediately gathered around to watch the spectacle.<br/><br/>Someone stepped forward and asked, “Chairman Liang, what’s going on? How could you be refused entry?”<br/><br/>Being refused entry to the exhibition meant that Godsend Technology Group was refusing to cooperate with the Liang’s group.<br/><br/>This was a signal.<br/><br/>In the shopping mall, who didn’t know that the companies refused to cooperate with Vireo Fresh Group and Godsend Technology Group were problematic companies.<br/><br/>In the business world, it is understandable to use some means for the sake of profit, but there was a bottom line!<br/><br/>Some things were better left unexposed, but once they were, it was very likely to face destruction, and no company could afford the consequences!<br/><br/>But the companies refused by Vireo Fresh Group and Godsend Technology Group were just like that!<br/><br/>That’s why many companies knew how to protect themselves and tried not to provoke Vireo Fresh Group and Godsend Technology Group!<br/><br/>Liang Haohan’s face looked particularly ugly!<br/><br/>He came for Godsend Technology Group’s new product order, but he never thought that he would be refused entry!<br/><br/>He stared with an angry face, suppressing his fury, “Which high-level person in your Godsend Technology Group is so powerful? Does President Xu know? You should know that Xu and I have some friendship!”<br/><br/>The person in charge said seriously, “It is an order from our President Xu!”<br/><br/>Everyone, “…” It’s embarrassing!<br/><br/>Liang Qiming’s heart tightened, and he had an ominous feeling that this matter might have something to do with Xiao Jinli!<br/><br/>Some time ago, Lin Family’s invitation letter was taken back, and it had been ridiculed for a long time!<br/><br/>Xu Guochang attended Lin Family’s engagement banquet, he must have been hinted by Xiao Jinli!<br/><br/>Yes, it must be like this!<br/><br/>Liang Qiming clenched his fists, his veins bulging, angry!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
