Do it now.”<br/><br/>Xiao Jinli asked, “Grandpa Chen, are you sure you want me to prescribe the medicine now?”<br/><br/>Old Chen said decisively, “Yes, child, please prescribe it for me now.”<br/><br/>Xiao Jinli nodded and said, “Okay.”<br/><br/>Then, she took out paper and pen from her bag and wrote down the prescription with vigorous strokes.<br/><br/>After finishing, she handed the prescription to Old Chen and instructed, “Old master, this prescription is only suitable for your constitution. Boil three bowls of water down to one, take it three meals a day. After seven days, I need to examine your body again and adjust the prescription.”<br/><br/>Old Chen took the prescription, and Xiao Jinli took out the processed dry hay from her bag and handed it to Old Chen, saying, “Put one in each time you decoct the medicine. Remember, this is the main medicine!”<br/><br/>These dry hay are from the space, rich in spiritual qi, which is to speed up the body’s adjustment.<br/><br/>Old Chen took it and said with a smile, “Okay!”<br/><br/>Old Li and Old Yuan stepped forward and said, “Child, come and take our pulse.”<br/><br/>Xiao Jinli took Old Li’s pulse first. Though he had many problems, none of them were significant. According to other doctors, he just needed medication control and routine care.<br/><br/>For Xiao Jinli, curing these things is not a problem.<br/><br/>However, when she took Old Yuan’s pulse, her brows deepened. Seeing this, everyone’s hearts were lifted, and they really wanted to ask, but they were afraid of being disturbed.<br/><br/>Xiao Zhang, who was following Old Yuan, was so nervous that his heart almost jumped out.<br/><br/>Xiao Jinli asked seriously, “Old Yuan  have you been getting regular check-ups for your body?”<br/><br/>Xiao Zhang quickly replied, “Yes, the old master’s body is checked every three months.”<br/><br/>“What problems did they check?” Xiao Jinli asked again.<br/><br/>Xiao Zhang said, “Well, there are high blood pressure, rheumatism, coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, and some old injuries.”<br/><br/>Old Yuan laughed and said indifferently, “People have to submit to old age. When you get older, all kinds of diseases come.”<br/><br/>Xiao Jinli asked seriously, “Is there anything else?”<br/><br/>“Is there  anything else?” Xiao Zhang asked with confusion.<br/><br/>Old Chen reacted at this moment and asked, “Child, do you mean Old Yuan has other diseases?”<br/><br/>Xiao Jinli nodded, “Yes. And this disease is quite severe!”<br/><br/>“How is that possible?”<br/><br/>“What disease?”<br/><br/>The first question was by Xiao Zhang, and the second was by Old Chen.<br/><br/>The reason Xiao Zhang spoke like this was that the recent examination was on the 26th of last month. The data on the examination report were all good, and no other diseases or conditions were discovered.<br/><br/>Now it’s only been a few days, and there’s a new disease.<br/><br/>No matter what, Xiao Zhang couldn’t believe it.<br/><br/>Xiao Jinli said, “Old Yuan, during this period, you occasionally have headaches, blurred vision, and sometimes tinnitus when you get up in the morning.”<br/><br/>Upon hearing this, Xiao Zhang immediately looked at Old Yuan and asked, “Old master, do you have these symptoms?”<br/><br/>Old Yuan nodded, “I do occasionally.”<br/><br/>“Old master, why didn’t you say anything?” Xiao Zhang asked anxiously. “If you have these symptoms, we can ask the doctor to come check on you.”<br/><br/>Old Yuan shook his head and said, “I’ve had headaches and tinnitus for a long time. But when I went for a check-up, they said it was caused by excessive internal heat. The doctor prescribed medication for me to control and adjust my condition. As for the occasional blurred vision, I just thought it was due to aging and my eyes weren’t working well.”<br/><br/>Old Chen immediately asked impatiently, “Child, aren’t Old Yuan’s symptoms caused by excessive internal heat?”<br/><br/>Xiao Jinli shook her head and said, “No. It’s   ”<br/><br/>She hesitated to look at Old Yuan.<br/><br/>Old Yuan said, “Child, whatever illness I have, just say it. No matter the result, I can bear it.”<br/><br/>Xiao Jinli said, “It’s brain cancer!”<br/><br/>“What brain cancer?”<br/><br/>Everyone was shocked again, hardly believing it.<br/><br/>“Impossible!” Xiao Zhang refused to believe, “If the old master really has brain cancer, why didn’t they find it in the last check-up?”<br/><br/>“Xiao Zhang!” Old Yuan scolded in a calm tone.<br/><br/>It’s a taboo for patients to question a doctor’s medical skills. Any doctor would be unhappy to hear it.<br/><br/>“Child, keep talking!” Old Yuan noticed that Xiao Jinli had more to say.<br/><br/>Xiao Jinli said, “Don’t worry, Old Yuan. You are still in the early stages of brain cancer, and it is treatable.”<br/><br/>After saying this, Xiao Jinli advised, “Grandpa Yuan, you can go to a big hospital for another diagnosis.”<br/><br/>Old Yuan did not refuse, “Okay.”<br/><br/>Xiao Zhang immediately said anxiously, “Old master, let’s return to Capital City for a check-up now!”<br/><br/>Old Chen also urged, “Yes, Old Yuan, you should hurry back to Capital City for a check-up. Don’t delay treatment for this disease. Even if it’s in the early stages, get treatment as soon as possible.”<br/><br/>Any disease related to “cancer” is a very severe condition.<br/><br/>Most cancers cannot be cured, only controlled to prolong life.<br/><br/>Alas, how much suffering Old Yuan is going to have to endure!<br/><br/>The treatment process for cancer is very painful, especially western medicine treatment.<br/><br/>However, Old Yuan looked at Xiao Jinli and sincerely asked, “Child, can you cure my disease?”<br/><br/>Xiao Jinli nodded, “I can cure it!”<br/><br/>Old Yuan didn’t hesitate and decided, “Fine, child, you will treat me!”<br/><br/>Everyone,<br/><br/>Xiao Zhang became anxious and said, “Old Yuan, let’s go back and get checked first, see what the doctor’s treatment plan is, okay?”<br/><br/>How could the old master’s body be casually left to a child?<br/><br/>Of course, he didn’t dare to say it casually.<br/><br/>Anyway, he was still doubting Xiao Jinli’s medical skills. After all, her age was too deceptive.<br/><br/>In general, the older a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, the more skillful they become.<br/><br/>For example, the doctor who regularly checked on the several old gentlemen was Master Jin Shanlin of Apricot Grove. He was 80 years old, and his medical skills were among the best in the country. He was hailed as a divine doctor who could rejuvenate.<br/><br/>But even Doctor Jin Shanlin didn’t find brain cancer in the old master. How could a little girl have such great ability?<br/><br/>So for now, the priority is to get the old master back for a thorough check-up and ask Doctor Jin to take his pulse again.<br/><br/>Xiao Jinli said, “Grandpa Yuan, you should go back for a check-up first. After the doctors confirm the diagnosis, see their treatment plan. If you really need it, give me a call, and I will go to Capital City to treat you!”<br/><br/>Old Li said at this time, “Old Yuan, I think the child is right. You should go back and get a comprehensive check-up, confirm it, and see what the doctor says. Don’t have a child treat you now. Even if you are willing, your superiors won’t agree. Don’t make it difficult for the child.”<br/><br/>Chapter 225: Chapter 225: Old Yuan Gets Brain Cancer (First Update)<br/><br/>Translator: 549690339<br/><br/>After knowing about Grandpa Jiang’s improved condition, Old Chen immediately asked, “Child, didn’t you say you’re going to prescribe me some medicine?
