Is it my phone’s problem or the network traffic issue?”<br/><br/>“Sis, I can’t send it either.”<br/><br/>“Same here, I wanted to show off to my friends, but I can’t.”<br/><br/>“Damn, none of us can send it. Why is that?”<br/><br/>“Obviously, it’s not our phones’ problem but the network here. I heard from a friend that once we enter Xiao Family Village, our cellphones will automatically connect to the village’s network. This network allows phone calls but has an automatic recognition feature. When a call connects, it identifies whether the information we’re sharing is confidential. If it’s confidential, the other party can’t hear it.”<br/><br/>“Wow! Is the network here that advanced?”<br/><br/>“And also, our photos and videos, if they’re not supposed to be sent, will automatically disappear from our phones once we leave Xiao Family Village.”<br/><br/>“No way! Is that true?”<br/><br/>“Of course, it’s true. My friend experienced it firsthand. At that time, he recorded a video of a beautiful girl in the village and wanted to share it with friends. But as soon as he left Xiao Family Village, all the videos and photos related to that girl disappeared from his phone.<br/><br/>At that time, he was scared out of his wits. One second he was looking at the video, and the next, it was gone. At first, he thought he accidentally deleted it and wanted to find it in the backup, but there was nothing there. Not just the video, but even the photos were gone. He thought his phone had a virus.<br/><br/>But when checked, his phone was fine, with no signs of being infected. He wasn’t satisfied, so he tried to find someone to recover those things, someone who was highly skilled in network technology. But after tinkering around, there was no trace of deletion, as if it had never existed. My friend even jokingly asked him if the girl he took a photo of was a ghost.”<br/><br/>In reality, he took a picture of Xiao Jinli.<br/><br/>Photos of Xiao Jinli would not be exposed to the outside world.<br/><br/>“Yeah, was the girl your friend took a photo of really a ghost? Otherwise, why would those photos just disappear without a trace?”<br/><br/>Several tourists who had never been to Xiao Family Village before were listening and felt a bit scared, as if they were hearing a horror story.<br/><br/>The man laughed and said, “Hey, what are you guys talking about? Do you think you could take a picture of a ghost in Xiao Family Village? Okay, let’s say you took a picture of a ghost, but shouldn’t it be the ghost in the photo that disappeared, not the entire photo?”<br/><br/>“Haha, no, I later learned from my friend who visited Xiao Family Village that the network here is different from the outside. It’s said that the network in Xiao Family Village is the highest technology, researched and designed by the Shenfeng Group. This kind of network has already been applied to the National Information Defense Department, the Ministry of National Defense, and other places. The network can automatically identify what is allowed to be sent and cuts off any restricted content to ensure information security.”<br/><br/>“Oh, I see. Such high technology can indeed be frightening.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
