This would openly inform everyone that someone was looking for information about Xiao Junxuan, and within five minutes, the information would surely reach Xiao Junxuan or other members of the Xiao Family.<br/><br/>After arriving, Lin Chengdong struggled to find a way to approach the situation.<br/><br/>The two bodyguards who followed him exchanged glances.<br/><br/>One of them respectfully asked, “Boss, do you need our help?”<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong looked at the two bodyguards, and his eyes lit up. He immediately said, “You guys go and inquire about Xiao Junxuan’s character.”<br/><br/>Hearing this, a bodyguard frowned and said, “Well boss, asking about the character of your… Xiao Junxuan only here in Xiao Family Village is somewhat unreliable.”<br/><br/>One of the bodyguards pointed out, “Although the Xiao Family didn’t say it, we could tell at a glance that their status in Xiao Family Village is special.<br/><br/>Even if Xiao Junxuan’s character is bad, who would dare to take the risk of offending the Xiao Family and say Xiao Junxuan has a bad character?<br/><br/>Moreover, I don’t even need to ask.<br/><br/>Considering Xiao Junxuan is the biological brother of Doctor Xiao and a brother to Su Yichen, we can assume that his character is decent.<br/><br/>After all, Su Yichen, the big shot in the business world, is well-known by many people.<br/><br/>He has a talent for business and a sharp eye for talent. In the Capital City, he doesn’t pay much attention to his relatives and friends, but here, he gets along so well with the Xiao Family members and calls Xiao Junxuan his brother.”<br/><br/>Yes, they have been following Lin Chengdong closely, always protecting him, so they naturally know everything.<br/><br/>However, they are also very tight-lipped and would not disclose any information to the outside world.<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong listened to the bodyguards’ words, frowned and said, “What you’re saying is actually reasonable. But I still don’t feel at ease without inquiring about Xiao Junxuan.”<br/><br/>At this point, he sighed lightly and said, “Xiaoxiao is my only biological daughter. This concerns her happiness for the rest of her life.”<br/><br/>One bodyguard thought for a moment and said, “Boss, we don’t need to deliberately inquire about him. We can just walk around the whole village and see if we can find any people who may not have a good relationship with the Xiao Family.”<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong shook his head, “Investigating the Xiao Family is even more out of the question.”<br/><br/>Inquiring about the Xiao Family is a much more serious matter than inquiring about Xiao Junxuan.<br/><br/>The Xiao Family has cultivated a genius like Xiao Jinli, so they must be extraordinary.<br/><br/>The two bodyguards listened to their boss’s words and were somewhat at a loss as to what to do.<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong shook his head and said, “Forget it, let’s just wander around the village.”<br/><br/>Then, he looked around in surprise and asked, “Is today a holiday or something? Why are there so many people?”<br/><br/>Tourism business is mostly during holidays.<br/><br/>The bodyguard laughed, “Xiao Village Farmhouse has now become a must-visit tourist attraction for tourists nationwide. In addition to the beautiful scenery, the main reason people come here is to eat the local gourmet food.<br/><br/>It has been said online that the food in Xiao Family Village is at a level that surpasses even Michelin three-star restaurants. The food in Michelin-starred restaurants is not affordable for everyone, and one has to queue to eat. Here, not only can you enjoy the beautiful scenery, but you can also taste delicious food. The most important thing is that Xiao Village Farmhouse is very famous now, so there is a saying that goes, ‘A true hero does not visit the Great Wall, and a true tourist does not visit Xiao Village.’<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong was silent for a moment and then said, “You guys seem to know a lot, huh?”<br/><br/>He knew that Xiao Family Village was famous because of its agricultural products, which were known for their pure and green nature without any pollution. The taste and quality were guaranteed, and the vegetables were said to cure diseases, prevent cancer, and even bring in people seeking medical treatment.<br/><br/>Many cancer patients came here with a glimmer of hope for treatment.<br/><br/>Many patients came here for the divine doctor.<br/><br/>Those who came here for treatment, unless they were too old or in the late stages of terminal cancer, were basically able to return in good health.<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong sighed softly and said, “Let’s go, take a walk around.”<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong took a few steps and then thought for a moment, saying, “Forget it, don’t follow me anymore.”<br/><br/>The expressions of the two bodyguards changed slightly, and they called out worriedly, “Boss?”<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong said, “Don’t worry, it’s very safe here. Even if people recognize my identity, nothing will happen.<br/><br/>“Many people have said that Xiao Family Village Farmhouse is the safest tourist destination. Even if a child gets lost, they can be found quickly. If someone tries to abduct a child, they won’t be able to leave the village. Most importantly, because there are many rich and powerful people here, security measures are in place. Alright, don’t worry, I just want to walk by myself.”<br/><br/>Who can understand the feelings of an old father like him, who just found his daughter and now has to face her getting married?<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong, dressed in a suit and leather shoes, strolled around.<br/><br/>Well, tourists in suits and leather shoes are not uncommon here, so it doesn’t look out of place.<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong looked around the village.<br/><br/>The village was beautiful, and since the transformation into a tourist area, the villagers’ houses were all villa-style, with front and rear yards, unified white walls, and red glazed tiles, arranged in rows, clean and comfortable.<br/><br/>However, many of the houses had signs advertising homestays, restaurants, and even a Taoyuan Town Snack Street, etc.<br/><br/>There were both original inhabitants and newcomers living in Xiao Family Village.<br/><br/>Due to limited land available, even wealthy newcomers had to follow a certain layout and architectural style, with no more than 160 square meters allowed. They could build additional floors, but it had to conform to the same style as the rest of the village.<br/><br/>Like the original inhabitants, they could build a small western-style building, with yards for growing vegetables and flowers.<br/><br/>In short, both the houses of original inhabitants and those of newcomers were beautiful.<br/><br/>However, the state-built Retirement Home for Cadres was a different, more classical style with slightly larger buildings, located at a distance from the open manor.<br/><br/>This building was not open to tourists and was guarded at all times to ensure the safety of the elderly inside.<br/><br/>In general, Xiao Family Village was divided into three areas: the residences of the original inhabitants, the residences of the newcomers, and the buildings of the Nursing Home for Cadres. Each area was distinct, easily identifiable, and offered a different beauty when viewed from a high vantage point.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
