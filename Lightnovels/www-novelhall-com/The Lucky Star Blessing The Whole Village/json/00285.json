It’s like the legendary Garden of Eden, the picturesque scenery of green mountains and clear water is so captivating.”<br/><br/>A middle-aged man standing aside, Xu Guochang, corrected her with a smile, “Mengmeng, this is Dragon State, not a foreign country. Dragon State’s paradise is called the Taoyuan Village. Oh, and this place is also called Taoyuan Town. Xiao Family Village belongs to Taoyuan Town.”<br/><br/>Xu Mengmeng excitedly asked,”Taoyuan Town, oh, is it the Utopia that we have learned about in cultural classes in Dragon State?”<br/><br/>“Yes, Utopia!” Xu Guochang chuckled, “It seems like Mengmeng knows a bit about the culture of Dragon State.”<br/><br/>Xu Mengmeng laughed and said, “Although I grew up in Plum Firm Country, my parents are from Dragon State. So, it’s natural that I would know about my Dragon State’s knowledge.”<br/><br/>“Hmm, our Mengmeng has really grown up,” Mother Xu, a middle-aged woman standing beside them, smiled and said, “Let’s go and look around. I have booked a table and a room at the Xiao Family Village Hotel. We can enjoy some delicious food and rest when we get tired, and then continue our tour.”<br/><br/>Getting restaurant reservations and rooms at the Xiao Family Village Hotel is quite difficult.<br/><br/>She had asked her friends from home to help with the reservations three months before their arrival.<br/><br/>Xu Guochang chuckled, “All right, you mother and daughter go ahead, I’ll be carrying our bags and taking some beautiful pictures for you.”<br/><br/>“Oh yeah!” Mengmeng said happily, “Then thanks to dad for his hard work. Mom, let’s go. Before coming here, I heard that the greatest pleasure here is to pick fruits on our own in the fields.”<br/><br/>Mother Xu nodded, “It seems, you’ve done quite a bit of research before coming.”<br/><br/>Mengmeng stuck out her tongue, blushing bashfully, “A lot of my friends have told me that the Xiao Family Farmhouse is a real fairyland on earth…Since it’s not easy to come here, of course, I had to learn more about it.”<br/><br/>Mother Xu nodded, “From what I heard from my friends, the DIY fruit picking here also has a limit. There are only thirty places available every day, and the quantity picked is limited to five kilograms.”<br/><br/>“Only thirty places every day?” Mengmeng asked with some confusion, “Why limit the slots? Isn’t it better if more people go to pick?”<br/><br/>Xu Guochang laughed and explained, “It might be better if there were more people, but there are so many tourists visiting Xiao Family Village every day. Without a limit, the several hundred thousand acres would be picked clean within days. Let’s go and watch the animal performance, and then stop by the picking on our way back. We can take back whatever we pick.”<br/><br/>“Animal performance?” Mengmeng’s eyes lit up, “What kind of performance? Is it like the television where tigers jump through the rings of fire?”<br/><br/>“Where did you see a tiger jump through a ring of fire on TV?” Xu Guochang laughed and said, “That’s all fake. In Dragon State, tigers are protected animals. Besides zoological parks, private individuals could not keep them. I’m not sure about tigers jumping through fire rings but I know that here, puppies can dance, chicks can dance, ducklings can dance, and even piglets can dance!”<br/><br/>Mengmeng,<br/><br/>So they all just dance? Isn’t there any other performance?<br/><br/>However, the curious family of three still went to the animal performance viewing area.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
