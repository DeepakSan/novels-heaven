We wish our company’s products sell well, and every person in Xiao Family Village gets better and better. Now, let Xiao Jinli pick the first cabbage for us. Xiao Jinli is our village’s Lucky Star.”<br/><br/>As soon as the Village Head finished speaking, the villagers applauded and even started cheering, “Lucky Star picks cabbage, Lucky Star picks cabbage…”<br/><br/>Xiao Jinli carried a colorful basket with a kitchen knife inside!<br/><br/>Cabbages need to be cut with a knife!<br/><br/>After cutting a cabbage, Xiao Jinli smiled and said, “Fellow villagers, our company’s products will definitely sell well, don’t worry. As long as we work hard, our days will definitely get better and better. We will walk the path to prosperity, or even get rich.”<br/><br/>“Yes, we believe our days will get better and better.”<br/><br/>Servant<br/><br/>Jiang Xile witnessed Xiao Jinli’s prestige and rallying power for himself this time.<br/><br/>The villagers of Xiao Family Village truly trusted Xiao Jinli, even to the point of blind worship.<br/><br/>Jiang Xile said to Gao Yanxin, “Your sister is just incredible! When she stands there, it’s like a queen inspecting her kingdom, encouraging her people to work hard!”<br/><br/>Gao Yanxin snapped out of it and slapped his own forehead in surprise, “That’s right, it’s exactly that kind of feeling. Our sister is like a queen. I used to say that my sister was like some kind of leader, but I couldn’t put my finger on what kind of leader. Now I know that my cousin is like a queen.”<br/><br/>Jiang Xile happily said, “With that aura and prestige, doesn’t she look like a queen?”<br/><br/>They muttered among themselves, making sure the villagers didn’t hear them, lest it made them uncomfortable or resentful towards Xiao Jinli.<br/><br/>After Xiao Jinli picked the first cabbage, the second group of people led by Xiao Yucheng and the Village Committee members with the Village Head picked their vegetables, each carrying a basket, and each person picking a different kind of vegetable in the field.<br/><br/>After the opening ceremony, everyone carried their baskets and headed to the field, carefully and diligently treating each vegetable as hope.<br/><br/>They very much hoped it would become their true path to wealth.<br/><br/>Seeing the hope for this path to wealth, they were visibly excited and happy.<br/><br/>In the future, Xiao Family Village would no longer be one of the poorest villages in the township due to its geographical environment.<br/><br/>Before the official picking, the Village Head had already assigned who would pick which type of vegetables.<br/><br/>So everyone just had to do their own job, cooperate, and soon, in less than two hours, 30,000 jin of vegetables were all picked, and the task was completed perfectly.<br/><br/>For vegetable transportation, the company used small trucks!<br/><br/>Each small truck delivered to one location, the furthest distance being the first to be transported.<br/><br/>They tried their best to arrive within the agreed-upon time.<br/><br/>Picking, washing, weighing, loading, every process was carried out with the utmost care, with no one being lazy or cutting corners.<br/><br/>They would not sacrifice long-term benefits for petty gain.<br/><br/>At three-thirty, the person in charge of weighing shouted, “We’ve reached the quota! The pickers can rest now.”<br/><br/>Although they could rest, everyone helped with washing, weighing, and loading!<br/><br/>It wasn’t until the last small truck left that everyone finally went home to rest.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
