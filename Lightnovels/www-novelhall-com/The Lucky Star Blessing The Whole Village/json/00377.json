It’s a treasure that money can’t buy.<br/><br/>In pursuit of this flower, countless people, either rich or noble, have fought bitterly.<br/><br/>But the best part is that only three pots of these flowers are sold every year, and the rest are given to those who are destined to receive them.<br/><br/>So Lin Chengdong was lucky enough to be one of the chosen ones.<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong didn’t know whether he should consider himself lucky.<br/><br/>No, it’s his biological daughter who is truly lucky.<br/><br/>People always say that a blessing may become a curse, and vice versa.<br/><br/>Throughout her life, Xiaoxiao has been framed by Lin Wanqing countless times. Although he doesn’t trust his own daughter, she’s managed to escape harm every time due to her good luck.<br/><br/>The two bodyguards with Lin Chengdong, both seasoned and experienced men, were naturally aware of the value of the Seven Color Tea Flower bottle held by their boss.<br/><br/>They were surprised by the generous gift, and then understanding dawned upon them.<br/><br/>This type of Seven Color Tea Flower, which is beneficial to health and also of ornamental value, can only be cultivated in Xiao Family Village in the whole world.<br/><br/>“Boss, congratulations! Your daughter has found herself a good husband!”<br/><br/>Both bodyguards sincerely said, “And congratulations on receiving a pot of invaluable Seven Color Tea Flower.”<br/><br/>One of the bodyguards said, “Xiao Family Village is truly magical. It might look like a small village, but it’s teeming with talent. And a simple pot of tea flowers, no one dares to rob.”<br/><br/>Not only the tea flowers, no one dares to rob anything here!<br/><br/>The other bodyguard said, “It is said that a nobleman in Luo Country wanted to take on this tea flower business, but was rejected. He tried to forcefully buy in, but overnight, he was covered in painful boils. Even more horrifying, the boils turned into faces and just couldn’t be cured! Later it was discovered that his body was reacting badly to the Seven Color Tea Flower. Just thinking of the idea would cause these boils, it was hilarious!”<br/><br/>Who can’t hear that this is a clearly a fabricated excuse?<br/><br/>But Xiao Family Village has this capability, and the nobleman had no choice but to give up his idea, becoming a laughing stock in the international arena.<br/><br/>Ever since, anyone who considered the idea, would think thrice before acting!<br/><br/>Someone who didn’t believe, attempted to take it by force. The instigator, however, was covered in boils all over. Even top experts from around the world could do nothing to cure him. In the end, he had to give up the idea, personally apologize, and only then did the disease dissipate.<br/><br/>The small Xiao Family Village has become the safest tourist destination in the world, undoubtedly shielded by its own mysterious power.<br/><br/>Otherwise, Xiao Family Village, a Feng Shui treasure land, might have been taken over by capitalists long ago!<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong laughed and said, “I’m quite surprised myself. I didn’t expect such a big gift from the Xiao Family. I don’t even know how to reciprocate! This afternoon at the hotel, I asked a waitress and learned that Xiao Junxuan’s father runs a real estate company, the top one in Ganjiang City. They’ve got no shortage of wealth. Xiao Zhang, Xiao Li, can you help me think about what kind of gift to return?<br/><br/>Bodyguards Xiao Zhang and Xiao Li glanced at each other, their brows furrowed, deep in thought.<br/><br/>“Boss, why not ask your daughter? She has been here for a while and knows the Xiao Family better. She might know what the Xiao Family needs, and then we can prepare accordingly?”<br/><br/>Upon hearing this, Lin Chengdong agreed.<br/><br/>He nodded with a smile, “Yes, I should ask Xiaoxiao.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
