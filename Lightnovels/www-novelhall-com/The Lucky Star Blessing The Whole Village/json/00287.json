After all, no matter how smart the dogs are, they cannot talk.<br/><br/>When the commander enters the field, the dogs have already formed their formations.<br/><br/>The commander holds a whistle in his hand, standing tall and looking serious. He walks in front of each team, takes a look, and then says, “Attention!”<br/><br/>The dogs straighten their front and back legs slightly and stand upright.<br/><br/>“At ease!”<br/><br/>“Right face!”<br/><br/>“Left face!”<br/><br/>The dogs’ heads turn together to the right and left. Some dogs immediately adjust their posture if they see that they are not standing straight!<br/><br/>“Wow, these dogs are so adorable. They’re like little kids, so cute!”<br/><br/>“These dogs are really smarter than people. Look at their straight lines, and they can understand the commander’s orders and even adjust their formation themselves. They’re so intelligent.”<br/><br/>“Why are all the animals here so spirited?”<br/><br/>After standing in attention, the commander immediately orders the dogs to run.<br/><br/>“As usual, the first three finishers will be rewarded with three big bones!”<br/><br/>Of course, others may not know, but the dogs know that there is pure Lingquan water from Xiao Jinli in these three big bones.<br/><br/>As a result, these dogs are running their hardest for the reward.<br/><br/>“Get ready to run!”<br/><br/>Each dog has a number, and the tourists will cheer for the dog they like based on its number.<br/><br/>“Go number five!”<br/><br/>“Go number twelve!”<br/><br/>However, since gambling is prohibited in this farmhouse, some people would definitely want to bet on which dog would win.<br/><br/>“Dad, all the dogs are running so fast, chasing each other. Which one do you think will win?”<br/><br/>Xu Guochang shook his head, “I really can’t tell.”<br/><br/>These dogs are all raised and trained together, so their physical fitness should be similar.<br/><br/>108 dogs running on the track are very brave.<br/><br/>After running three kilometers, number 3, number 48, and number 99 win the top three spots.<br/><br/>After the race, the commander holds six big bones.<br/><br/>He says, “First place, number 48, rewarded with three big bones!”<br/><br/>As soon as his words fall, not only do the audience applaud, but the dogs also clap in congratulations.<br/><br/>“Ah, ah, it’s so cute. These dogs can actually clap. They’re so adorable.”<br/><br/>“These dogs are so smart, they can even congratulate their companions.”<br/><br/>“Haha, I really want to take one home.”<br/><br/>“With more than a hundred dogs, why don’t they deliver?”<br/><br/>The dogs’ performance ends quickly.<br/><br/>Afterward, some people want to take a group photo with the dogs.<br/><br/>So, the dogs line up again, just like humans, arranging a group photo formation.<br/><br/>Standing in the middle are the top three dogs, holding their big bones with pride, just like humans would.<br/><br/>In the front row center, there’s a chair, prepared for the guests who want to take a photo.<br/><br/>Xu Mengmeng’s family of three also went to take pictures with the dogs.<br/><br/>Actually, most people wanted to take pictures, but there were too many people who wanted to take pictures, so the line was very long.<br/><br/>Xu Mengmeng was very excited to pull her parents to take pictures with the dogs.<br/><br/>Time flew by, and they only watched two shows, more than half a day had passed.<br/><br/>Mother Xu said, “Let’s go, it’s time to eat.”<br/><br/>Then, the family of three went to the Xiao Family Village Hotel.<br/><br/>Xiao Family Village Hotel was built by the people of Xiao Family Village, with an investment of two hundred million, and it was even bigger and grander than a company.<br/><br/>The hotel did not seek a star rating, but the guests who had stayed there had always given the hotel one consistent evaluation: heartwarming.<br/><br/>That’s right, the hotel’s service was very warm-hearted.<br/><br/>From the cleaning staff to the general manager, they all greeted the guests with sincere smiles, asking for their needs and trying their best to meet the guests’ needs.<br/><br/>What impressed people the most when they entered the hotel was that there were many green plants inside, the air was good, and it felt very comfortable.<br/><br/>Guests who were strolling outside might feel tired and even dizzy.<br/><br/>But as soon as they entered the hotel, their heads felt clear and their whole body relaxed.<br/><br/>Unlike other places, even though the environment in the hotel looked good, the air was not as fresh as outside, and the head was not much more comfortable.<br/><br/>Xu Mengmeng exclaimed, “The air in this hotel is so good, it smells so comfortable!”<br/><br/>Mother Xu looked at the green plants in the hotel and said, “These plants purify the air. Let’s go to the restaurant and eat something!”<br/><br/>Xu Mengmeng thought for a moment and said, “Mom, I heard there is a cafeteria here. Why don’t we go to the cafeteria for a meal! I heard there are hundreds of dishes to choose from in the cafeteria. I want to taste the gourmet food here.”<br/><br/>Mother Xu nodded and said, “Alright, let’s go to the cafeteria!”<br/><br/>Although the hotel had a restaurant, the Xiao Family Village also set up a separate cafeteria.<br/><br/>The cafeteria was designed for the vast number of tourists.<br/><br/>Xu Mengmeng’s family of three found the cafeteria using the map.<br/><br/>Xu Mengmeng stood in front of the cafeteria, looking at the sign, “Delicious Cafeteria!”<br/><br/>The Delicious Cafeteria was built not far from the hotel, only about fifty to sixty meters apart.<br/><br/>The layout of the cafeteria was similar to that of a university, with a variety of food options.<br/><br/>The cafeteria was large, with two floors, and could accommodate 4,000 to 5,000 people at a time, serving fifty to sixty thousand guests a day.<br/><br/>However, unlike ordinary cafeterias, every dish at the Delicious Cafeteria was very tasty, and they did not try to simply get by because there were so many guests.<br/><br/>In addition to the top-quality ingredients, the cafeteria also employed well-known chefs.<br/><br/>Each chef was an expert in making a specific dish.<br/><br/>Over a hundred dishes were made by over a hundred chefs.<br/><br/>Of course, the prices in the Delicious Cafeteria were higher than those in other cafeterias.<br/><br/>For example, a beef steamed bun that was sold for two yuan elsewhere was sold for two yuan and fifty cents here. A serving of beef noodles that was sold for eight yuan elsewhere was sold for ten yuan here…<br/><br/>Most tourists could accept these prices, especially in a tourist area where prices were generally higher. And, as is well-known, the ingredients in Xiao Family Village were much better than those in other places, so to sell at ordinary prices was already a significant discount.<br/><br/>“Ah, I want egg-filled pancakes, pumpkin pies, …”<br/><br/>Xu Mengmeng ordered more than ten kinds of gourmet food.<br/><br/>Mother Xu stopped her and said, “That’s enough, Mengmeng, we can’t finish all of this. Let’s try these first, and if it’s not enough, we’ll order more!”<br/><br/>Xu Mengmeng nodded and said, “Alright, let’s eat first!”<br/><br/>She looked around at the full seats, and everyone’s faces showed satisfied expressions, with many people even praising the food repeatedly.<br/><br/>“The food here is so delicious.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, I thought the cafeteria would just have ordinary taste, but I didn’t expect the food to be so good, and it’s not expensive. If only I could take some to go, I would definitely pack more to take home.”<br/><br/>“Unfortunately, they don’t allow takeout here.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, it’s a pity!”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
