This top technology is only used by the country and Xiao Family Village.<br/><br/>At present, this automatic identification network technology will not be widely used until Dragonzhou Country’s overall technological capabilities reach a certain level.<br/><br/>Those who have come to visit Xiao Family Village know that there are two beautiful women in the village.<br/><br/>One is the cafeteria lady, although she has aged, her face has no wrinkles, her skin is delicate, her features are exquisite, and her figure is tall and perfect. With the charm and grace of her age, she is a nationally stunning beauty. Men who see her are instantly attracted and cannot move away.<br/><br/>If it were not for the fact that Xiao Family Village could not cause trouble, this boss lady would probably be surrounded by men for her looks.<br/><br/>The other beauty is a young girl, about twenty years old, with long black hair, smooth white skin, very beautiful features, and a tall and perfect figure. Even in ordinary clothes, she looks like a fairy who has fallen into the mortal world.<br/><br/>Such two beautiful people must have been captured in many people’s cameras.<br/><br/>However, once they leave Xiao Family Village, there is no trace of them in the cameras.<br/><br/>Therefore, the beautiful women of Xiao Family Village are just a legend in the mouths of tourists. To see them with their own eyes, one can only go to Xiao Family Village.<br/><br/>“Wow, Xiao Jinli is really beautiful. She’s even more beautiful than the TV stars.”<br/><br/>“Yes, she is so beautiful. The so-called first beauty in the entertainment circle is like the difference between the mud and the bright moon compared to her.”<br/><br/>“It’s a pity that such a beautiful girl doesn’t become a celebrity.”<br/><br/>“This love confession of the handsome man and beautiful woman is really pleasing to the eye. By the way, is this man really not Su Yichen? He looks exactly like Su Yichen.”<br/><br/>“I just heard the children of Xiao Family Village say that this man is called Little Brother Xiao Quan and is from Xiao Family Village. So, the two of them just look alike, they should not be the same person.”<br/><br/>“No, Su Yichen is so rich that he must have the qualification to live in Xiao Family Village. Living in Xiao Family Village can also be considered a villager. As for the other name, it’s just a change of name, not a big deal.”<br/><br/>“Ah, now that you mention it, I also think that’s the case. Su Yichen is called Su Yichen outside, but Xiao something Quan in Xiao Family Village. It’s very possible. However, this Xiao Jinli should be a native of Xiao Family Village.”<br/><br/>“I guess so. My friend came here before, saw her, and even took her picture, but when he left Xiao Family Village, her photo was gone.”<br/><br/>“Sigh, this Xiao Family Village is so mysterious and secure.”<br/><br/>“Of course, it feels safe. You should know that Xiao Family Village Farmhouse Tourist Spot has been rated as the safest tourist spot nationwide. It is said that for many years, not a single child has been lost. Even if the children accidentally get separated from their parents while touring the manor, they will quickly be sent to Xiao Family Village Security Office by the security guards, waiting for their parents to find them. Also, there have been no incidents of fighting or violence in Xiao Family Village.”<br/><br/>“Sigh, how does Xiao Family Village do this? Every day there is such a large flow of people, especially during holidays, the flow is unbelievably large, and yet they can achieve no accidents, it’s really a miracle.”<br/><br/>“Isn’t it?”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
