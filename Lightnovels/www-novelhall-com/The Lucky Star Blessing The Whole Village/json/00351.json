The man looked momentarily startled before turning to Lin Wanqing and whispered, “Miss Lin, your dad is still in the living room.”<br/><br/>Upon hearing this, Lin Wanqing, who had appeared somewhat tipsy, immediately sobered up.<br/><br/>She looked at Lin Chengdong, who was sitting on the sofa with a stern expression, and exclaimed in surprise, “Dad!”<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong stood up, glanced at the man, and then looked at his daughter, his face dark with anger as he asked, “Is he your boyfriend?”<br/><br/>“No, no, he’s not,” Lin Wanqing shook her head and replied, “He’s just an ordinary friend.”<br/><br/>A mere gigolo, thinking of him as a normal friend was already overestimating him.<br/><br/>Lin Wanqing then asked, “Dad, what’s going on? It’s so late, and you’re still up. Is something wrong?”<br/><br/>It was rare for Lin Chengdong to wait up for her at night.<br/><br/>Because in Lin Chengdong’s eyes, she had always been a well-behaved girl.<br/><br/>She never came home later than 11:00 pm.<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong’s eyes were fixed intently on her, making Lin Wanqing shudder involuntarily. She called out again, “Dad?”, her voice filled with confusion and surprise.<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong came back to his senses and sighed softly, “I’m worried about your sister. She’s been out of touch with me for so long, and I’m really uneasy. Qingqing, are you sure Xiaoxiao really went to Changbai Mountain? Why do I feel so uneasy?”<br/><br/>Lin Wanqing breathed a quiet sigh of relief and then smiled, “Dad, you’re worrying too much. My sister is fine, she just doesn’t want to contact you. Besides, she didn’t go to Changbai Mountain alone; she went with her boyfriend.”<br/><br/>“Boyfriend?” Lin Chengdong asked meaningfully, “Qingqing, do you know where Xiaoxiao’s boyfriend is from and what he does for a living?”<br/><br/>Lin Wanqing laughed and said, “Dad, how would I know that? You know my sister has always misunderstood me and we don’t get along, so why would she tell me any of this?”<br/><br/>“Really? If you don’t get along, then why has she called you every two days for the past several days, instead of calling me, her father?” Lin Chengdong suddenly asked, “And what a coincidence, I wasn’t present every time she called? Qingqing, can you explain this to me?”<br/><br/>It was Lin Wanqing who had a poor relationship with Lin Xiaoxiao.<br/><br/>Lin Wanqing was the cause of the rift between Lin Chengdong and Lin Xiaoxiao.<br/><br/>So why would Lin Xiaoxiao only call Lin Wanqing while she’s missing, and that too every two days?<br/><br/>It was obviously not possible.<br/><br/>So, peeling away the veil of mystery, everything became crystal clear.<br/><br/>He had just been blind to it all before.<br/><br/>Lin Wanqing opened her mouth to explain, but her expression changed drastically at Lin Chengdong’s next words.<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong said, “And isn’t it strange? The people I sent to look for Xiaoxiao found her cellphone in an abandoned house in an old residential area. That house hasn’t been lived in for a long time, but more than twenty days ago, a man rented it. Yet no one has seen Xiaoxiao’s whereabouts.”<br/><br/>Upon hearing this, Lin Wanqing’s expression first turned dumbstruck, and then she cried out in horror, “Dad, are you saying that my sister’s phone was stolen? Then who has been contacting me these days?”<br/><br/>Lin Chengdong,\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
