Although the price is a bit higher, the taste is absolutely good. Here, have a try of our tomatoes.”<br/><br/>The customers in the store wrinkled their noses and laughingly said, “These tomatoes smell really good too.”<br/><br/>After saying that, they took a small bite, and their eyes lit up immediately, exclaiming with surprise, “These tomatoes are really delicious! They are sweet, and have a kind of refreshing sweetness to them.”<br/><br/>“Are these tomatoes really that delicious?”<br/><br/>Everyone else also gave it a try, “Indeed, these tomatoes are really tasty. I’ve lived for over sixty years and have never tasted such delicious tomatoes.”<br/><br/>“These tomatoes are a bit expensive, but they are so delicious. My grandson will definitely like them. I’ll buy two kilograms.”<br/><br/>“I’ll take two kilograms as well, to eat like fruit.”<br/><br/>Qiu Lianying originally planned to buy only two or three kilograms, but seeing so many people buying, she immediately said, “Give me ten kilograms.”<br/><br/>There were so many customers in the store, and many of them would order cold mixed tomatoes or stir-fried tomatoes and eggs as soon as they arrived.<br/><br/>There were only about forty to fifty kilograms of tomatoes in the store, most of which had been bought by Qiu Lianying in installments. Now, all of a sudden, she bought another ten or so kilograms, leaving only about twenty in the store.<br/><br/>It seemed like there were still quite a few, but with this wave of customers, two kilograms here, three kilograms there, the twenty kilograms were gone in no time.<br/><br/>Many people who tasted the tomatoes immediately took a bite after purchasing them, savoring the juicy and aromatic flavor that filled their mouths.<br/><br/>After buying the tomatoes, these neighbors started to think about the other vegetable smells they had noticed in Qiu Lianying’s restaurant. They wanted to taste the flavors of the other dishes as well. They thought it would be okay to buy something a bit more expensive just for once.<br/><br/>As a result, the crowded store attracted even more passers-by with their curiosity. They went in to take a look, and seeing everyone excitedly purchasing vegetables, they became curious as well, buying some items to take home.<br/><br/>By evening, the vegetables in the store had basically sold out.<br/><br/>Xiao Chunhua and the others finally breathed a sigh of relief.<br/><br/>Third Mother smiled and said, “My heart, which was tight all day long, has finally relaxed. These vegetables have finally been sold.”<br/><br/>Second Aunt also chimed in, “That’s right, I was worried all along that the items in our store wouldn’t sell out today. Eggs can be stored for a few days, but meat and vegetables, if not sold by tomorrow, won’t be fresh anymore.”<br/><br/>Xiao Chunhua laughed and said, “It seems that we have to thank the lady boss next door at the Taste Fresh Restaurant. She bought a lot of vegetables from us today, and the delicious smell of the dishes she cooked attracted many customers.”<br/><br/>Third Mother became worried again, saying, “Today’s vegetables are sold out, but I don’t know what will happen tomorrow.”<br/><br/>Xiao Chunhua reassured her, “Don’t worry. Now that our vegetables have sold out today, we just have to wait for the returning customers tomorrow. These returning customers will definitely bring new customers with them. But according to the company’s plan, during the first three days of opening, the store will only sell 1,500 jin. So, selling out tomorrow shouldn’t be a big problem.”<br/><br/>Second Aunt said, “That’s right, we should have confidence in our vegetables. Anyone who has tasted our vegetables would want to eat them again. Let’s just wait and see tomorrow.”<br/><br/>The three of them tidied up the store and closed for the day.<br/><br/>The company had rented a house for them as a dormitory, which was fully furnished with home appliances and furniture, and had a water heater and gas stove, making it very convenient.<br/><br/>After taking a shower and having dinner, the three of them went to bed early.<br/><br/>They had to go to the store at 5 o’clock tomorrow morning to receive the goods.<br/><br/>The next day at 5 o’clock, they received the goods, moved them to the store, and began organizing the shelves and categorizing the vegetables.<br/><br/>They started the business at 6:30 am.<br/><br/>However, customers arrived as early as 6:00 am.<br/><br/>“Do you have tomatoes today?” An old grandma asked.<br/><br/>Xiao Chunhua recognized her as a customer from yesterday who had bought the last two tomatoes, and was surprised to see her coming so early today.<br/><br/>Xiao Chunhua smiled and said, “Yes, Grandma, how much do you need?”<br/><br/>“Give me two kilograms, no, five kilograms. My daughter’s grandson will be visiting today, so I’m buying more. Also, I saw that you sell duck meat here yesterday, right?”<br/><br/>“Yes, we sell duck meat. Grandma, how much do you want to buy?” Xiao Chunhua asked with a smile.<br/><br/>“How much is it per jin?” The old grandma asked.<br/><br/>“Our original price is 30 yuan per jin, but we have a 20% discount on everything in the store for the first three days of opening.”<br/><br/>The old grandma hesitated, “That’s so expensive? Even with a 20% discount, it’s still 24 yuan, which is quite high, compared to the market price of 16 yuan per jin.”<br/><br/>Xiao Chunhua smiled and said, “Grandma, all of the items in the store are grown and raised by ourselves, so their quality and taste are worth the price! Like these tomatoes, with this size, this taste, don’t you think they deserve the price? Grandma, why don’t you try some and see?”<br/><br/>The old grandma thought for a moment and said, “Fine, I’ll buy half a duck for now! But if I find that it’s not worth the price, I’ll definitely come back! I’m not that easy-going!”<br/><br/>Xiao Chunhua laughed and said, “Of course, my store is right here. If you have any dissatisfaction, feel free to come back and let me know, and we will deal with it accordingly if there’s an issue with our items.”<br/><br/>The old grandma laughed and said, “Alright, I’ll buy it just because of your attitude! Hehe…”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
