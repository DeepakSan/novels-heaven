Even so, his speed was incredibly fast, far surpassing that of the Condensation Spirit Realm.<br/><br/>It was only after a month that Fang Wang finally saw the vast continent where the Xuan Dynasty was located.<br/><br/>From afar, the spiritual energy of nature was dense, forming dragon-shaped waves above the sea of clouds, as if true dragons blessed the Xuan Dynasty.<br/><br/>Xiao Zi and Zhao Zhen, upon seeing this sight, both felt an immense pressure, but they dared not make a sound.<br/><br/>Fang Wang was indifferent; his body shook as he transformed into a black hawk, soaring toward the continent with Xiao Zi clinging tightly to his back, while Zhao Zhen withdrew into the Soul Devouring Gourd, fearful of exposing his master.<br/><br/>In the Xuan Dynasty, inside the Imperial Palace.<br/><br/>Fang Jing sat on the steps, his body covered with scars, and even his delicate and handsome face bore tiny scars. At the moment, he was gazing at the silhouettes of the cultivators flying back and forth in the distance, his eyes full of longing.<br/><br/>He too wished to roam the skies freely like those cultivators, unrestrained by anything.<br/><br/>At that moment, a middle-aged palace maiden entered the courtyard with a brocade wood box and sat down next to him. She opened the lid and took out a plate of pastries for him, smiling affectionately, “The Western Noble Consort didn’t wish to eat Spiritual Food today, and it’s your good fortune. Eat, it will strengthen your blood and bones.”<br/><br/>Fang Jing took the plate, first offering a piece of pastry to the middle-aged palace maiden, and then eating a second piece himself.<br/><br/>Seeing him act so sensibly, the middle-aged palace maiden’s face beamed with relief.<br/><br/>“Such a good child…”<br/><br/>As soon as she said this, she began to feel uncomfortable. The more considerate Fang Jing was, the more she felt sorry for him.<br/><br/>Fang Jing ate the pastries in small bites. Such Spiritual Food was hard to come by, and he treasured it greatly.<br/><br/>While eating, he curiously asked, “Why are there so many cultivators patrolling recently? Has something happened?”<br/><br/>The middle-aged palace maiden replied, “Indeed, there has been trouble. An overseas force known as the Jin Xiao Sect has caused our Xuan Dynasty quite some trouble.”<br/><br/>“Jin Xiao Sect?”<br/><br/>Fang Jing was overjoyed but hesitated to ask further, fearing he might reveal something.<br/><br/>The middle-aged palace maiden looked at him and sighed, “Could it be the Jin<br/><br/>Aldo DecL lidS collie IOL you: 1 duvlse you LO lidLDOL any nopes. AIL110ug11 Lile<br/><br/>Jin Xiao Sect has caused trouble, it cannot shake the foundation of the Xuan<br/><br/>Dynasty. Every day, Jin Xiao Sect Cultivators attempt to infiltrate the Imperial Palace, only to be executed and their corpses hung at the city gates.” Fang Jing’s face turned pale upon hearing this.<br/><br/>He wanted to say something but was at a loss for words. He knew his own strength was not enough to escape the Imperial Palace, and he did not want to put the middle-aged palace maiden in danger, as it could easily lead to her demise.<br/><br/>Taking a deep breath, he stood up, plate in hand, ready to return to his room. Just then, he caught a glimpse of a black shadow in the sky.<br/><br/>“What is that?”<br/><br/>Fang Jing pointed upwards and asked.<br/><br/>The middle-aged palace maiden turned and murmured, “It should be an eagle. It has been a long time since an eagle was seen in the Imperial City; we usually only see sparrows.”<br/><br/>Fang Jing took another look and then turned to enter his house.<br/><br/>No sooner had he stepped inside, that the middle-aged palace maiden saw the black eagle in the sky diving toward the Imperial Palace. Her face changed dramatically.<br/><br/>The black eagle dived at an incredibly fast speed, and as it came close to touching the Imperial Palace, a barrier of light appeared, attempting to block it. Almost instantly, the black eagle transformed into a man in black, shattering the Formation’s light barrier with his foot.<br/><br/>With a thunderous bang!<br/><br/>The entire Imperial Palace shook violently, as if struck by an earthquake.<br/><br/>Fang Jing hurried out of the house, swallowing the pastry in his mouth and anxiously asking, “What’s happening?”<br/><br/>The middle-aged palace maiden was about to respond when a cold voice echoed throughout the city:<br/><br/>“He who kills Fang Xun shall die!”<br/><br/>This voice was like thunder, speeding up the heartbeats of all who heard it, as though a heavy hammer had struck their chests.<br/><br/>Fang Jing’s eyes widened, and his mouth followed suit. He quickly called out,<br/><br/>“Save…”<br/><br/>The middle-aged palace maiden promptly covered his mouth and dragged him back into the house, the door following closely behind.<br/><br/>On the other side.<br/><br/>In the vast central square of the Proclamation Palace, rubble fell like rain, dust billowed, and the ground was marked with cracks resembling spider webs.<br/><br/>One by one, figures with powerful auras descended from the sky, landing in all directions, surrounding the rolling dust. Each took out their Lifespirit Treasures, ready for battle.<br/><br/>A colossal snake’s head burst out from the dust, its body twisting like a dragon scattering the dirt around it, and Fang Wang’s figure soon became visible.<br/><br/>The Heavenly Dao Imperial Dragon Crown shimmered with a cold light in the sunlight, the Golden Scale White Feather Robe fluttered in the wind, strands of golden dragon aura encircled his body, and in his right hand, he held the Heavenly Palace Halberd, his expression icy.<br/><br/>“Audacious! How dare you barge into the Xuan Dynasty Imperial Palace uninvited, who are you?”<br/><br/>At the front of the square, atop the steps stood a burly man draped in Silver Armor, his handsome face framed by a helmet adorned with two phoenix wings, his cape billowing like flames, holding a long spear. His aura was overwhelming, his killing intent locking onto Fang Wang.<br/><br/>More and more Cultivators appeared, most armored, and outside the Imperial Palace, a grand formation light screen was erected, sealing the inside from the outside.<br/><br/>Fang Wang raised his left hand and slowly clenched it into a fist; at that instant, a terrifying oppressive force blanketed the entire Imperial Palace, the ground trembled violently, and every soldier’s and Cultivator’s face changed drastically.<br/><br/>“Kill!<br/><br/>The Silver-Armored man brandished his spear and bellowed an order; from all sides, more than a thousand Cultivators violently lunged at Fang Wang.<br/><br/>Suddenly, Fang Wang threw a punch, and a Black Dragon followed his left fist, targeting the Silver-Armored man directly. The faces of the Cultivators in front changed dramatically, unable to dodge in time, they were obliterated into mist by the Black Dragon.<br/><br/>A dragon roar exploded!<br/><br/>In an instant, the Black Dragon reached the steps. Facing the unstoppable Black Dragon, the Silver-Armored man thrust out with his spear single-handedly, a ferocious spiritual energy surged from the tip, forming a colossal barrier in front of the splendid palace, reaching straight for the heavens.<br/><br/>Boom!<br/><br/>The Black Dragon burst through the spiritual energy barrier, the Silver-Armored man’s face paled, and before he could think more, a figure shot out from the Black Dragon’s maw, the blade of the Heavenly Palace Halberd reflecting in his pupils.<br/><br/>Purcch!<br/><br/>The Heavenly Palace Halberd pierced through the Silver Armor, piercing the chest of the Silver-Armored man, blood splattered, his eyes widened, then Fang Wang skewered him with the halberd. He tried to struggle but felt a domineering Spiritual Power tightly binding him, preventing him from escaping the Heavenly Palace Halberd.<br/><br/>Fang Wang held him aloft in midair, as countless soldiers and Cultivators surged toward him from behind.<br/><br/>“You…”<br/><br/>The Silver-Armored man stared intently at Fang Wang, his eyes filled with fear.<br/><br/>Fang Wang looked up at him, letting him gaze into a pair of extremely cold eyes.<br/><br/>What kind of look is this…<br/><br/>The Silver-Armored man had lived for hundreds of years, endured countless tough battles, but this was the first time he had encountered such a chilling gaze.<br/><br/>Suddenly, Fang Wang stomped his foot, and the entire ground collapsed, the Golden Hall in front instantly shattered, all buildings within a five-mile radius crumbled, the ground caved in, and terrifyingly hot flames of yang energy burst from beneath the earth, incinerating the Cultivators behind him.<br/><br/>In an instant, screams and cries filled every corner of the Imperial Palace as if a heavenly tribulation had descended.<br/><br/>The room where Fang Jing was located also shattered, and he was held tightly by the middle-aged Palace Maiden. Amidst the tumultuous winds, they appeared as fragile and insignificant as if they’d be blown away at any moment.<br/><br/>Fang Jing, in the arms of the middle-aged Palace Maiden, gazed into the distance. He saw Fang Wang’s figure, far away but difficult to miss due to the compelling golden dragon aura enveloping him.<br/><br/>He had never seen such a commanding presence before, akin to a True Immortal descending from the heavens.<br/><br/>“Who is he…”<br/><br/>Fang Jing thought unsettledly, praying inside that the figure was there to save him.<br/><br/>“Seeking death! ”<br/><br/>An enraged shout echoed through the Imperial Palace; a figure turned into afterimages, cutting through the layers of yang flames like a specter, striking at Fang Wang from behind with a palm.<br/><br/>Boom!<br/><br/>The terrifying impact raised a cloud of dust. sweeping across the entire<br/><br/>Imperial Palace.<br/><br/>The Golden Scale White Feather Robe on Fang Wang rippled without ceasing, but his stance was unshaken. Standing behind him was a man dressed in dragon robes, the Imperial Crown atop his head vibrating intensely. The man wore an expression of disbelief.<br/><br/>His all-out palm strike failed to harm the opponent!<br/><br/>Fang Wang turned swiftly and kicked him, sending him flying and spewing blood into the air.<br/><br/>The man in dragon robes recovered with a tumble and landed, but the powerful force still sent him skidding backwards for dozens of yards. After stopping, he couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood and knelt down, his right hand clutching his chest where all his ribs had been shattered.<br/><br/>“How could this strength be…”<br/><br/>The man in dragon robes ground his teeth; he was at the Ninth Layer of the<br/><br/>Mahayana Realm and yet couldn’t withstand a single kick from the opponent!<br/><br/>The Xuan Dynasty Cultivators quickly came to his side, concerned for his safety. He was none other than the Emperor of the Xuan Dynasty, Emperor Chongyuan!<br/><br/>Emperor Chongyuan pushed away the soldiers around him and rose to his feet. He looked at Fang Wang from afar and shouted angrily, ‘Who are you, and what is your relationship with Fang Xun?”<br/><br/>Fang Wang, holding the Heavenly Palace Halberd with his right hand and skewering the Silver-Armored man, turned around. He felt the presence of more and more powerful auras rushing towards him; the auras of those in the Mahayana Realm had already surpassed a hundred.<br/><br/>Xiao Zi crouched on his shoulder, trembling, equally sensing the terrifying auras coming from all directions.<br/><br/>Fang Wang slowly rose into the air, his overwhelming yang energy transforming into a blazing flame around him. At that moment, he looked like a Sun God descending to earth. He looked down at Emperor Chongyuan with a cold voice that echoed between heaven and earth:<br/><br/>“I am Fang Xun’s elder brother, Fang Wang. You may address me as Heavenly Dao. Hand over the wife and child of Fang Xun and the one who killed him, or else, I will enact justice on heaven’s behalf and ensure the Xuan Dynasty’s lands are shattered!”<br/><br/>He deliberately made his voice carry far, wanting the people of the Xuan Dynasty to know of this affair.<br/><br/>This calamity was brought upon them by the Xuan Dynasty royal family for killing Fang Nun!<br/><br/>Upon hearing Fang Wang’s words, Fang Jing was immediately excited. However, the middle-aged Palace Maiden clung to him tightly, covering his mouth, not allowing him to break free. She pressed her forehead against Fang Jing and urged in a frantic whisper, “Don’t be rash….”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
