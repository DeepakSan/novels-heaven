The realms before the Profound Heart Realm were all about accumulating basics, requiring external objects, but breakthroughs thereafter relied on enlightenment and talent. Of course, perhaps even higher realms would need external objects to break through fate.<br/><br/>After all, everyone has their own limit.<br/><br/>With the Heavenly Palace, where was his limit?<br/><br/>As he thought about it, Fang Wang’s mind drifted to the opportunity for immortality mentioned by Zhao Qi.<br/><br/>Perhaps by sticking close to Zhou Xue’s side, he could seize a chance for ascension, but doing so, over time, Zhou Xue might find it hard to respect him. At the very least, in his heart, Fang Wang felt indebted to her, and he had to walk a path of his own, especially since he possessed the Heavenly Palace. Mortals can’t become immortals, but he refused to accept that without trying!<br/><br/>Days passed.<br/><br/>Fang Wang’s cultivation was continuously growing, inching closer to the Condensation Spirit Realm.<br/><br/>Even as the head disciple, no one disturbed him, allowing him to cultivate in peace.<br/><br/>Xiao Zi was also cultivating, after all, since Fang Wang didn’t allow it to go out alone, it could only practice cultivation.<br/><br/>Who knows how much time had passed.<br/><br/>Fang Wang finally sensed the opportunity for a breakthrough. He opened his eyes and asked, “Xiao Zi, how many years have passed?”<br/><br/>Unlike before, when he practiced Qi Gathering, his thoughts were not in a state of enlightenment, allowing him to maintain awareness of the outside world.<br/><br/>Xiao Zi, lying in the pool, replied, “Nearly two years, I think.”<br/><br/>Upon hearing this, Fang Wang thought to himself how time flies.<br/><br/>When he began to immerse himself in the mental method of the Condensation<br/><br/>Spirit Realm, time flew by so quickly that it felt like only a few days had passed.<br/><br/>Fortunately, he was finally touching upon the opportunity for a breakthrough. The very thought of soon breaking through the Condensation Spirit Realm excited him tremendously.<br/><br/>Fang Wang continued to practice his cultivation technique, getting ready for the breakthrough.<br/><br/>Meanwhile.<br/><br/>At the Main Meridian, in front of Shiyuan Hall’s plaza.<br/><br/>Nine Channels’ disciples stood in nine rows, twenty people each, with Fang Hanyu, Fang Zigeng, Ye Xiang, Zhou Xing Shi, Gu Li, and Zhou Bo among them.<br/><br/>Zhao Chuanqian stood before everyone, his expression solemn, saying, “This mission is fraught with peril, even for those in the Profound Heart Realm, there is the risk of death. However, this matter is of great importance, and it could even decide the future safety of the Da Qi Cultivation Realm. No one should be careless, understand?”<br/><br/>Upon hearing this, the one hundred and eighty disciples responded in unison, “Understood!”<br/><br/>Some were expectant, others nervous.<br/><br/>Fang Zigeng was among the nervous ones, standing at the end of the fifth Channel, continuously calming his emotions.<br/><br/>The head disciple of the third Channel, Li Yu, asked, “Which sects will support<br/><br/>Zhao Chuanqian looked at him and calmly said, “That will be discussed when the time comes.”<br/><br/>Li Yu, realizing his faux pas, dared not ask further.<br/><br/>Following that, Zhao Chuanqian leaped into the air, a Flying Sword appearing beneath his feet, and the other disciples immediately followed on their swords with majestic grandeur.<br/><br/>The disciples who saw this along the way were all curious, wondering what task they were undertaking.<br/><br/>Zhao Chuanqian held a very high position within the Great Abyss Gate, and most of the disciples behind him were Direct Disciples. Figures like Ye Xiang, Fang Hanyu, and Gu Li had significant reputations, and such an assembly clearly indicated they were bound for an important task.<br/><br/>Inside Shiyuan Hall.<br/><br/>Guang Qiuxian was meditating on a cushion, with nine Peak Masters standing below him.<br/><br/>Yang Yuanzi started, “They have set out. When should I inform my disciple?”<br/><br/>The other Peak Masters, upon hearing this, all turned their eyes to Guang Qiuxian, filled with anticipation. The disciples they sent out were among the best of their Channels, and the loss of any of them would pain them greatly. If Fang Wang could take action, the death rate would naturally decrease.<br/><br/>In their minds, Fang Wang was already the first within the Great Abyss Gate, and they even felt that Guang Qiuxian might not be a match for Fang Wang.<br/><br/>Bear in mind, Fang Wang hadn’t taken action for many years, and his strength was surely far beyond what it once was.<br/><br/>Guang Qiuxian pondered and said, “Let’s wait a bit longer, giving the other disciples a chance to gain experience. Those geniuses with Earth Origin Spirit Treasures should also grow. Imagine, if Fang Wang were absent, they would be like Lu Yuanjun, ready to dazzle when reaching the Profound Heart Realm.”<br/><br/>One Peak Master frowned and said, “Although the Chi Devil Sect has been struck by the Jin Xiao Sect and is seriously weakened, they remain Da Qi’s number one demonic sect, and that is their territory. I always feel there’s a plot brewing.”<br/><br/>His words were echoed by the other Peak Masters, who joined in expressing their concerns, hoping Guang Qiuxian would not be complacent.<br/><br/>“No need to worry, for this operation we also have the alliance of the<br/><br/>Suspended Vast Sword Sect and the Tian Shu Sect. We will surely obliterate the Chi Devil Sect!” exclaimed Guang Qiuxian, waving his sleeve, rarely showing such vigor.<br/><br/>Because of Chen Anshi, he detested the Chi Devil Sect the most.<br/><br/>The second Peak Master stepped forward and asked, “With the three sects joining forces, to whom will the ultimate treasure belong?”<br/><br/>Guang Qiuxian narrowed his eyes and said, “Of course, the capable will occupy it. I have already agreed with the other two sects to join forces in annihilating the Chi Devil Sect first, and then discuss the ownership of the supreme treasure. Even if we do not obtain the supreme treasure, we can still seize the wealth of the Chi Devil Sect or their territory. Either way, all three sects will not suffer any loss.”<br/><br/>Upon hearing this, the Peak Masters were no longer puzzled.<br/><br/>Guang Qiuxian continued to assign tasks, with everyone listening intently.<br/><br/>One month later.<br/><br/>The gate of Fang Wang’s cave residence trembled slightly, with the disturbance gradually expanding. Eventually, the entire third meridian mountain shook, alarming the disciples inside the cave residence as they rushed out. On the adjacent second and fourth meridians, many took notice of the commotion on the third meridian.<br/><br/>Yang Yuanzi descended from the sky and landed in front of Fang Wang’s cave entrance. Suspended mid-air, his face showed a look of astonishment and his eyes held a complex expression.<br/><br/>The elders of the third meridian arrived one after another, all looking towards Fang Wang’s cave residence.<br/><br/>“Is this commotion because he is making a breakthrough?”<br/><br/>“When the Sect Leader made his breakthrough into the Condensation Spirit<br/><br/>Realm, there was a similar commotion. Could it be that…”<br/><br/>“Hiss… The Condensation Spirit Realm? How old is he? Has he reached fifty yet?”<br/><br/>“No, he should only be forty-three. Unbelievable. Throughout the ages, has there ever been a forty-three-year-old in the Condensation Spirit Realm?”<br/><br/>“Such a powerful aura. It feels like the restrictions of the cave residence can barely contain him.”<br/><br/>As the event at the third meridian became more intense, more and more people hurried over, including Sect Leader Guang Qiuxian and Vice Sect Leader Chai Yi.<br/><br/>The nature’s spiritual energy within Great Abyss Gate crazily surged towards Fang Wang’s cave residence, a sight to behold.<br/><br/>The Direct Disciples watched behind the elders, discussing animatedly, followed by disciples of various levels who all floated in the air, their numbers growing increasingly.<br/><br/>Guang Qiuxian stroked his beard, sighing, “Indeed, he is about to break through to the Condensation Spirit Realm. It seems I also should step aside.”<br/><br/>He had long known that Fang Wang was destined to achieve the Condensation Spirit Realm. Although not surprised, he felt mixed emotions.<br/><br/>All the elders felt the same. Compared to Fang Wang, they were truly mediocre.<br/><br/>Vice Sect Leader Chai Yi said nothing, but the look in her eyes toward the cave entrance was thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Soon, the news that Fang Wang was about to prove the Condensation Spirit Realm spread, and all who heard it were invigorated.<br/><br/>The Condensation Spirit Realm! That was the legendary realm, a realm most disciples would never reach. Since the realms of Guang Qiuxian and Chai Yi had not been passed down to the lesser disciples, Fang Wang’s breakthrough seemed even more shocking.<br/><br/>Reaching what was regarded as the highest realm in their understanding before the age of fifty, he was like a living legend in their eyes.<br/><br/>As time went on, the turmoil at the third meridian grew larger and larger. The other eight meridians, the main meridian, and the main city could all feel it, and the earth-shattering noise was deafening.<br/><br/>The Fang Family Disciples who stayed in Great Abyss Gate also arrived, gathering together. Disciples who recognized them came over one after another to congratulate the Fang Family.<br/><br/>In today’s Da Qi, there were no Great Cultivators of the Condensation Spirit Realm within any noble family, at least not publicly!<br/><br/>At the same time.<br/><br/>Inside the cave residence.<br/><br/>Fang Wang was breaking through. The Solaris Scripture condensed nine fireballs that hovered behind his head, while a light shadow floated above his head, identical to himself—it was his Primordial Spirit, maintaining the same meditative posture.<br/><br/>Xiao Zi lay by the pond, watching Fang Wang, her snake eyes full of envy.<br/><br/>She wished to be that powerful as well!<br/><br/>Fang Wang continuously changed hand gestures, operating his cultivation technique as his Spiritual Power rose steadily.<br/><br/>After a while.<br/><br/>Fang Wang suddenly opened his eyes, his Primordial Spirit above his head instantly entering his body, releasing a powerful shockwave from within him that swept across the mountain and outward in all directions, creating a visible shockvvave.<br/><br/>Guang Qiuxian immediately cast a spell, forming a huge barrier with his own Spiritual Power to block this shoclwave, protecting the disciples behind him from impact.<br/><br/>The mountain sections of the second and fourth meridians at the same altitude as Fang Wang’s cave residence were hit by the shock, but fortunately, this force did not destroy the two mountains but only caused them to shake.<br/><br/>The spiritual energy vortex circling the third meridian suddenly dispersed, the tremors of the third meridian ceased, and calmness returned to the world.<br/><br/>Everything returned to tranquility, but all could feel an immense pressure emanating from the third meridian!<br/><br/>“It’s a success. Worthy of the Heaven Yuan Spirit Treasure, it really went smoothly,” Guang Qiuxian lamented. He remembered that when he broke through to the Condensation Spirit Realm, he nearly failed—a failure that could have led to both death and the destruction of his cultivation path.<br/><br/>He had been sensing the smooth elevation of Fang Wang’s aura, and this made him truly feel the gap in talent between himself and Fang Wang.<br/><br/>Inside the cave residence.<br/><br/>Fang Wang felt the Spiritual Power of the Condensation Spirit Realm and a satisfied smile appeared on his face.<br/><br/>If he ever encountered the encirclement by Green Cicada Valley like before, he truly had the confidence to take them all out. The elevation of his realm was not just an increase in Spiritual Power; the quality of his Spiritual Power was improving as well.<br/><br/>He had finally reached the Condensation Spirit Realm!<br/><br/>Not only that, but he could also forge another Lifespirit Treasure!<br/><br/>Awesome!<br/><br/>Fang Wang could sense the crowd outside, but he did not pay attention to them, continuing to consolidate his cultivation.<br/><br/>Feeling that Fang Wang had successfully broken through, Guang Qiuxian immediately disappeared from the sky, leaving only a sentence: “Let the disciples leave, don’t disturb Fang Wang from consolidating his cultivation.”<br/><br/>Hearing this, the Peak Masters and elders of the Nine Channels quickly ushered the disciples to disperse..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
