To enforce justice on heaven’s behalf? Ridiculous!”<br/><br/>Emperor Chongyuan burst into loud laughter, as if he had heard the funniest joke under heaven. His face twisted into a fearsome grimace, his eyes filled with hatred. He roared, “Fang Wang, is it? Well done, today I’ll send you to meet your despicable and shameless brother!”<br/><br/>No sooner had the sound of his voice faded than Fang Wang’s gaze fell upon nlm, and a territymg gust ot wind swept toward nim, torcmg mm to take a step back.<br/><br/>Boom—<br/><br/>An earth-shattering bell toll rang out across the entire Imperial City, dizzying to the soul, even causing the Formation light screens around the Imperial Palace to twist and warp.<br/><br/>Ominous thunderclouds gathered, oppressive Heavenly Might enshrouding everything!<br/><br/>“Master, what realm is this?” Xiao Zi nervously asked from Fang Wang’s shoulder.<br/><br/>Fang Wang’s expression remained neutral as he said, “Above the Mahayana Realm, the Nirvana Realm. Hide in my arms.”<br/><br/>Hearing this, Xiao Zi immediately burrowed into Fang Wang’s embrace.<br/><br/>A ray of golden light suddenly shot down from the gathering thunderclouds, illuminating the ruins within the Imperial Palace and stirring up clouds of dust in rings of expansion.<br/><br/>Within that golden light, a figure slowly descended, not holding back the vastness of his aura at all.<br/><br/>“Calling yourself Heavenly Dao, how recklessly ignorant!”<br/><br/>A voice full of ancient dignity and authority came forth, followed by an elder in a grey Dao robe stepping out. He was tall and imposing; his robe was embroidered with green lotuses. He held a horsetail whisk in his hand, his white hair bound beneath a headdress, behind which circled a string of prayer beads, forming a halo.<br/><br/>Fang Wang placed his gaze upon him and calmly asked, “State your name.”<br/><br/>The grey-robed elder replied with a tone laced with contempt, as if speaking to an insignificant insect, “I am the Real Man of Qing Mountain. Have you ever heard of me?”<br/><br/>“Senior, don’t waste words with him, just kill him!” Emperor Chongyuan angrily commanded, coughing from excessive excitement, which caused his blood to circulate poorly.<br/><br/>Fang Wang’s kick had been too vicious, and residual forces were still rampaging in his body.<br/><br/>“It’s the first time I’ve heard of you, but you’ll be worth remembering, for you will be the first Nirvana Realm I slay!” Fang Wang coldly stated, then took steps towards the Real Man of Qing Mountain.<br/><br/>He had deliberately shattered the buildings within the Imperial Palace to flush out Fang Xun’s wife and child. He had perfected his control over the Yang energy, able to avoid harming the innocent.<br/><br/>As he walked towards the Real Man of Qing Mountain, his divine sense searched throughout the entire Imperial Palace.<br/><br/>Elsewhere.<br/><br/>A middle-aged Palace Maiden holding Fang Jing was moving away from the battlefield when suddenly a hand pressed down on her shoulder. She turned to look and collapsed to the ground in fright, and Fang Jing took the opportunity to break free, attempting to run towards Fang Wang but was caught by a man in Purple Brocade Clothes. Before he could react, the brocade-clothed man swiftly pressed several acupoints on his body, rendering him immobile and even unable to make a sound.<br/><br/>“My lord, please spare him, he’s just a child…” the middle-aged Palace Maiden pleaded bitterly. The brocade-clothed man’s scarred face was devoid of emotion, and with a kick, he sent the Palace Maiden flying and knocked her unconscious upon landing.<br/><br/>Fang Jing gazed towards the distant Fang Wang, his eyes brimming with despair.<br/><br/>In his field of vision, more and more Cultivators were surrounding Fang Wang, the sky steadily darkening, the light from Fang Wang’s body being suppressed.<br/><br/>Fang Jing had barely glimpsed hope, but at that moment, his heart plunged into an unprecedented depth of despair.<br/><br/>Because his great uncle was growing more distant from him…<br/><br/>‘l’ne brocade-CIOtned man 11tted Fang Jing to leave. suddenly, ne telt tne cnlld in his arms tremble violently. On instinct, he looked down, but before he could react, a formidable aura burst forth from within his grasp.<br/><br/>“Aaaahhhhhh—”<br/><br/>Fang Jing violently threw back his head, screaming at the top of his lungs. His face, his neck’s veins bulged and strange, tattoo-like black lines appeared on his forehead.<br/><br/>“Not good!”<br/><br/>The brocade-clothed man cursed internally; almost instantaneously, a terrifying murderous intent locked onto him. Instinctively, he leapt away, twisting in midair.<br/><br/>Turning his head, his pupils contracted sharply.<br/><br/>Fang Wang came at him with an exaggerated speed, snatching Fang Jing from his arms with his left hand, and thrusting the Heavenly Palace Halberd with his right, powerfully impaling the man’s chest, blood spurting from the blade.<br/><br/>“Uh… Ah…’<br/><br/>Suspended in midair on the Heavenly Palace Halberd, the brocade-clothed man’s blood cascaded uncontrollably from his mouth, yet before it could splash upon Fang Wang, it was incinerated into mist by his Yang energy.<br/><br/>With a shake of his left hand, Fang Wang caused the brocade-clothed man to explode on the spot, his blood raining down from the sky.<br/><br/>Ten li away among the ruins, the Real Man of Qing Mountain turned to look, his eyebrows furrowing, a chill in his heart at the swift speed he witnessed!<br/><br/>He could sense that Fang Wang had not used any Secret Technique, but that it was the response speed of his physical body!<br/><br/>Something was off about this guy’s physique!<br/><br/>“Kill him, kill him now! ” Emperor Chongyuan screamed impatiently, having completely lost his imperial composure, descending into madness.<br/><br/>The Real Man of Qing Mountain turned, swung his horsetail whisk, soared into the air, and flew towards Fang Wang, leaving behind a declaration, “Your Majesty need not worry. Today, no one can save him. He is destined to die and vanish from the Dao.”<br/><br/>Outside the Imperial Palace, from four directions, a Daoist in each one strode through the air, shocking the soldiers and Cultivators along the way to turn their heads in awe.<br/><br/>What a powerful aura!<br/><br/>Fang Wang looked down at Fang Jing in his arms and softly asked, “Are you okay?”<br/><br/>He channeled Spiritual Power into Fang Jing’s body to help stabilize the surge of Mysterious Power within.<br/><br/>Actually, Fang Wang had seen Fang Jing earlier; however, with the presence of the True Man of Qing Mountain, he was afraid of startling the enemy. The moment he heard Fang Jing’s cry, he couldn’t afford to consider so much.<br/><br/>Fang Wang could prevent his own yang energy from harming Fang Jing—in fact, he could make Fang Jing feel warm. When he lifted his head to look at Fang Wang, his small face was filled with panic and residual fear. As soon as he recognized Fang Wang’s face, his eyes instantly turned red, and tears uncontrollably began to flow.<br/><br/>“Are… are you my uncle Fang Wang…”<br/><br/>Fang Jing asked anxiously; he had been too far away before and couldn’t see Fang Wang’s face clearly.<br/><br/>Fang Wang frowned, looking at the injuries on his face, feeling even more guilty. He let go of the Heavenly Palace Halberd and drew out a long scarf from the Dragon Jade Ring with his left hand. While tying Fang Jing to himself, he asked, “Yes, I am. Where is your mother?”<br/><br/>At just under nine years old, Fang Jing was thin and small, hanging against his chest without obstructing his sight.<br/><br/>“My mother… she’s dead…” After saying this, Fang Jing couldn’t hold back his emotions any longer and began sobbing unconsolably.<br/><br/>Fang Wang’s hands momentarily froze, then he quickly finished tying Fang<br/><br/>Jing to himself. He spoke in a low voice, “Xiao Zi, make sure he doesn’t fall.”<br/><br/>Just then, Xiao Zi poked her snake head out from the collar on his shoulder and hissed, “Master, rest assured.”<br/><br/>The weeping Fang Jing subconsciously looked towards Xiao Zi and was startled nearly to death; luckily, he was already tied to Fang Wang and didn’t fall headlong.<br/><br/>“There, there, don’t be scared, I’m your Auntie Snake…” Xiao Zi comforted, and Fang Jing looked at it blankly.<br/><br/>Fang Wang turned around to face the incoming True Man of Qing Mountain, and the Heavenly Palace Halberd beside him vanished into thin air.<br/><br/>“Tian Dao Fang Wang, do you think you can escape with him? Do you think that’s possible?”<br/><br/>The voice of the True Man of Qing Mountain arrived before him.<br/><br/>Fang Wang cracked his neck, his eyes gradually becoming sharp, as white flames mixed with the fires of yang energy around him.<br/><br/>Heavenly Dao True Skill!<br/><br/>“Escape? Who said I was going to escape? I will kill you, then force you all to surrender whoever murdered my brother and sister-in-law, including the mastermind behind the scenes, all must die!”<br/><br/>Fang Wang’s tone was ice cold, devoid of any emotion, and as he spoke, he took step by step towards the True Man of Qing Mountain.<br/><br/>Boom, boom, boom—<br/><br/>The ground shuddered dramatically with him at the center, stones within a radius of thirty feet taking flight uncontrollably, and thunderclouds in the sky churning violently, quickly followed by flashes of lightning.<br/><br/>Extreme killing intent enveloped the entire Imperial Palace, silencing everyone, even Emperor Chongyuan, who was raging, shut his mouth.<br/><br/>Fang Wang abandoned all other emotions, retaining only the intent to kill. This was the power of the True Combat Technique.<br/><br/>His reason for forsaking the Heavenly Palace Halberd was to make everyone here feel despair; killing them with the Heavenly Palace Halberd would have been too easy on them.<br/><br/>Feeling Fang Wang’s aura, the True Man of Qing Mountain frowned. He immediately swung his horsetail whisk, muttering something under his breath, and in a flash, two phantom images of himself flew out from inside him—formidable replicas without the horsetail whisk, each wielding a sword shadow.<br/><br/>Suddenly!<br/><br/>Fang Wang’s figure disappeared from view, and a terrifying and unparalleled gust of wind charged straight towards the ascending True Man of Qing Mountain. He and his two shadows quickly formed Spell gestures, swinging their horsetail whisks and swords in unison towards the front.<br/><br/>A green light burst forth, and three enormous characters appeared in front of them: Suppress, Exterminate, Purify.<br/><br/>The three characters overlapped at an extremely fast speed, emanating a vast and dominating aura as if to block the formidable Fang Wang charging at them.<br/><br/>Boom!<br/><br/>Fang Wang’s punch shattered the three characters, his right fist unstoppable, striking the True Man of Qing Mountain’s abdomen and sending him skyrocketing, tearing through the storm clouds.<br/><br/>This scene shocked Emperor Chongyuan and the cultivators of the Xuan Dynasty so profoundly it was as if they had witnessed the most terrifying sight in the world.<br/><br/>Fang Wang wasted no words and immediately surged towards them!<br/><br/>“Protect the Emperor!”<br/><br/>Emperor Chongyuan shouted loudly. This Mahayana Realm sovereign couldn’t maintain his composure as he took out a golden parasol, placing it above his head.<br/><br/>Thousands of Great Cultivators moved as one towards Fang Wang, with the lowest among them at the Cross-Void Realm. They wielded their Lifespirit Treasures and cast Spells, but Fang Wang was too fast—like a searing beam of light slicing through the dim world, one cultivator after another was blasted into a mist of blood, or sent flying away.<br/><br/>Fang Wang, with the ferocity of a thunderbolt, reached directly over Emperor Chongyuan’s head. In that instant, time seemed to stand still, with Fang Jing clenching tightly onto his uncle’s shoulder and Xiao Zi coiling around Fang Jing’s upper body, her head leaning back as if about to be dragged out.<br/><br/>Fang Wang’s right fist, bearing a dragon-shaped force, smashed down. Emperor Chongyuan looked up, his face filled with horror.<br/><br/>As Fang Wang’s right fist came down, the golden parasol shattered instantly.<br/><br/>Just then, four figures struck from different directions, as swift as ghosts, each reaching Emperor Chongyuan’s side in quick succession, raising their hands to strike upwards.<br/><br/>Four palms collided with one fist. The already ruined ground collapsed once again, innumerable stones were sent flying, and a terrible wave of energy erupted like a volcanic explosion, piercing the clouds.<br/><br/>The wild wind ravaged everything, the Formation twisted violently, and the streets outside the Imperial City crumbled one after another while the citizens fled in terror and cultivators scattered everywhere to cast Spells and save people.<br/><br/>Amidst the rolling dust, Fang Wang looked down expressionlessly at the five people below. His fist descended slowly, while the arms of the four protecting Emperor Chongyuan began to bend downward. Emperor Chongyuan, seeing this, constricted his pupils.<br/><br/>“Is the power of Nirvana so weak?”<br/><br/>Fang Wang’s indifferent voice reached the ears of the five..\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
