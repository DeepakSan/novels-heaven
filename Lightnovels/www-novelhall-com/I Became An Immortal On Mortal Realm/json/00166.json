When he opened them again, he was already inside the Heavenly Palace.<br/><br/>Fang Wang revealed a smile. The owner of this golden hall was truly straightforward, actually engraving the Spells on the pillars for those fated to cultivate.<br/><br/>He just didn’t know how powerful this Spell was.<br/><br/>He sat down on the spot and began to recall the methods of cultivation.<br/><br/>This Buddhist scripture was a type of mantra, named the Great Vajra Mantra, capable of subduing souls and driving out evil spirits, exerting a fierce and overbearing suppressive effect on souls.<br/><br/>It took Fang Wang roughly thirty years to learn the Great Vajra Mantra. Before this, his understanding and attainment regarding the soul were already profound, so this did not mean that the Great Vajra Mantra was weak.<br/><br/>After another ninety years, he finally mastered the Great Vajra Mantra to Great Perfection.<br/><br/>The Great Perfection of the Great Vajra Mantra did not require moving one’s mouth, a mere thought from the heart-mind could make the light of Buddha shine everywhere, with the sounds of Buddha naturally echoing.<br/><br/>For Fang Wang, spending one hundred and twenty years in seclusion was simply a trifling matter. After he left the Heavenly Palace, he still had the mental energy to cultivate another Cultivation Technique.<br/><br/>He turned to look, wanting to see which of the redwood pillars had the most scripture carved into it. There were dozens of redwood pillars inside the hall, and naturally, he had no intention of cultivating them all. He feared that doing so would cause his Dao heart to collapse.<br/><br/>Soon, he noticed that the redwood pillars on both sides of the Golden Buddha had the most scriptures, and even the color of the characters shone slightly differently.<br/><br/>The one on the left was darker, while the one on the right was brighter.<br/><br/>Fang Wang first approached the left side, observing carefully.<br/><br/>“Stop looking and go behind the Golden Buddha. Although the Grand An Qi<br/><br/>Yuan cannot enter the hall, I’m afraid they might use tricks to trap you inside. Then there’s Fo Ling, it’s certainly watching you, and whether it brings fortune or disaster is hard to predict,” the voice of Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable, once again reached Fang Wang’s ears with an urgent tone.<br/><br/>Fang Wang ignored it and focused on the pillar.<br/><br/>The text on the redwood pillar was not jumbled, and he carefully discerned whether to read it horizontally or vertically, as well as the left and right directions.<br/><br/>However, the scripture on this pillar was several times that of the Great Vajra Mantra, which took him even longer.<br/><br/>After some time.<br/><br/>Fang Wang finally entered the Heavenly Palace. Without a word, he immediately sat down in meditation and began to recall this scripture.<br/><br/>A body refining technique!<br/><br/>Vajra Invincible Saint Body!<br/><br/>When Fang Wang clarified this Cultivation Technique in his mind, his heart skipped a beat.<br/><br/>This Vajra Invincible Saint Body feels as if it’s no less powerful than the Heavenly Gang Saint Body Technique!<br/><br/>Fang Wang remembered that it took him nearly a thousand years to cultivate the Heavenly Gang Saint Body Technique…<br/><br/>Now he could only pray that the foundation he had in the Heavenly Gang Saint Body Technique would shorten the time needed to cultivate the Vajra Invincible Saint Body.<br/><br/>The Vajra Invincible Saint Body was to forge the world’s most indestructible flesh while containing powerful Yang Energy, preventing evil spirits from approaching and exerting a strong suppressive force on the soul body.<br/><br/>The Heavenly Body’s physical strength was formidable compared to ordinary constitutions, with the main advantage being its powerful recovery ability. Yang Du’s wounds healed very quickly, and so did Fang Wang’s Spiritual Power.<br/><br/>Actually, Fang Wang had never suffered any severe injuries, so he wasn’t clear on the limits of his Heavenly Body.<br/><br/>Regardless, Fang Wang naturally hoped that the Vajra Invincible Saint Body would be as strong as possible.<br/><br/>Preferably, it would surpass the Heavenly Body!<br/><br/>Thus, Fang Wang began his journey of cultivating the Vajra Invincible Saint Body.<br/><br/>Body as indestructible as a Vajra, soul as scorching as the supreme Yang sun, sweeping away all evil spirits of the world, becoming the supreme Yang god amongst men!<br/><br/>It must be said that the introduction to the Vajra Invincible Saint Body was indeed awe-inspiring. The deeper Fang Wang perceived it, the more he looked forward to it.<br/><br/>Years passed by quickly.<br/><br/>It took a full four hundred years before Fang Wang barely managed to cultivate the Vajra Invincible Saint Body, and in combination with the Solaris Scripture, his Spiritual Power was like flames, searingly intense.<br/><br/>Minor success was not enough!<br/><br/>Fang Wang continued to cultivate.<br/><br/>The following years became monotonous, as body cultivation techniques lacked variety, so he had to endure the tedium.<br/><br/>After about another five hundred years, Fang Wang finally cultivated the Vajra Invincible Saint Body to a stage of significant achievement, and then he had to strive for the Great Perfection Realm.<br/><br/>Fang Wang took a deep breath, opening his eyes. A thought passed through his mind, and the Heavenly Palace transformed back into that golden hall; he changed the environment to shift his mood and continued his cultivation.<br/><br/>From achieving significant accomplishment to reaching Great Perfection, Fang Wang felt that this stretch of time was even longer than all the time he had spent before.<br/><br/>By the time he had completely cultivated the Vajra Invincible Saint Body to Great Perfection, when he looked back in retrospect, the total time spent cultivating this time amounted to one thousand seven hundred years!<br/><br/>Seeing this duration, Fang Wang’s heart trembled.<br/><br/>It was torture!<br/><br/>Fortunately, he had finally persevered!<br/><br/>In an instant, everything around shattered, and Fang Wang returned to reality. He opened his eyes, forcibly suppressing the urge to devour the nature’s Spiritual Energy.<br/><br/>Although he had cultivated the Vajra Invincible Saint Body to Great Perfection, fully transforming into the Vajra Invincible Saint Body required activating the technique, consuming nature’s Spiritual Energy, and refining the body. However, he was inside the Grand An Resentment Temple and did not want to cause too much commotion, lest he attract some horrifying being.<br/><br/>Fang Wang took a deep breath, his eyes carrying a weight of ages. He turned to look towards the redwood pillar on the right side of the Golden Buddha, pausing in his tracks.<br/><br/>Given the time spent on cultivation, the Vajra Invincible Saint Body was very likely to be stronger than the Heavenly Body. The redwood pillar on the right side of the Golden Buddha might also contain a profound supreme technique that was no less inferior to the Vajra Invincible Saint Body. He was hesitating on whether or not to learn it.<br/><br/>After entering the golden hall, he had been in seclusion for over one thousand eight hundred years. While everything before his eyes seemed unchanged, in his heart, it was as if seas had turned to mulberry fields.<br/><br/>“What’s wrong with you? Junior brother, don’t scare me. You mustn’t have encountered a demonic barrier. Stop looking at those pillars!”<br/><br/>The voice of Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable, came, filled with anxiety.<br/><br/>Suddenly, Fang Wang asked, “What is the origin of the Grand An Divine Dynasty?<br/><br/>His tone was different from before, making Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable, feel as though he had been possessed. But since he could ask such a question, it at least proved that he had not been possessed by the evil spirits of the Grand An Divine Dynasty.<br/><br/>The Grand An Divine Dynasty was a divine dynasty from ancient times, ruling over the fate of the human tribe. According to my investigations, this<br/><br/>Mortal Realm once had a brilliant era when the human tribe did not believe in Immortal Gods but revered the emperor as heaven. Later, the Grand An Divine Dynasty disappeared, and a long gap emerged in the Mortal Realm. After that, no other divine dynasty was born,” transmitted Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable.<br/><br/>“That is all I know. This Grand An Resentment Temple must have held a significant status within the Grand An Divine Dynasty, perhaps even in the center of power within the dynasty.”<br/><br/>Hearing this, Fang Wang grew even more curious about the Grand An Divine<br/><br/>Dynasty.<br/><br/>Considering the Vajra Invincible Saint Body, the Grand An Divine Dynasty indeed was powerful.<br/><br/>The Descending Dragon Great Saint, who founded the Heavenly Gang Saint<br/><br/>Body Technique, could contend with the Immortal Gods of The Upper Realm. The Vajra Invincible Saint Body is even stronger than the Heavenly Body. Just what kind of glorious peak did the Grand An Divine Dynasty reach?<br/><br/>With this thought, Fang Wang took a deep breath and moved forward.<br/><br/>He made his way to the large redwood pillar on the right side of the Golden Buddha.<br/><br/>“Junior Brother, don’t be foolish!” exclaimed Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable, in urgency.<br/><br/>Fang Wang closed his eyes and began to prepare himself mentally.<br/><br/>What’s another 1,700 years in seclusion?<br/><br/>Okay!<br/><br/>It’s a bit risky.<br/><br/>The thought alone made Fang Wang anxious, for this would become the longest period of seclusion in his life, especially after his previous cultivation of the Vajra Invincible Saint Body.<br/><br/>But with such an opportunity laid before him, it would be such a waste to miss<br/><br/>Fang Wang gritted his teeth. Damn it, if he wanted to become an immortal, he had to be ruthless with himself!<br/><br/>He possessed the Heavenly Palace, so he shouldn’t just be content with its power but should maintain the fierce determination of other cultivators, which would help him maintain the Heavenly Palace’s supremacy!<br/><br/>All in!<br/><br/>Fang Wang’s eyes snapped open, and he carefully read the inscriptions on the redwood pillar.<br/><br/>Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable, fell silent; he thought Fang Wang was beyond help.<br/><br/>Line by line, the words entered Fang Wang’s eyes. With the experience of reading both the Great Vajra Mantra and Vajra Invincible Saint Body, he immediately found the correct order of cultivation this time.<br/><br/>After just one look, he memorized everything and proceeded to enter the Heavenly Palace.<br/><br/>Fang Wang opened his eyes to confirm that he was in the Heavenly Palace, and immediately sat down to meditate.<br/><br/>The Great Celestial Infinite Scripture!<br/><br/>It was another Cultivation Technique!<br/><br/>Fortunately, it was compatible with the Vajra Invincible Saint Body; the Vajra<br/><br/>Invincible Saint Body refined the physical body, whereas the Great Celestial Infinite Scripture would allow his Spiritual Power to become vast, expanding the cultivator’s reserve of Spiritual Power.<br/><br/>It could be practiced alone or based on other Qi Gathering Techniques.<br/><br/>Once mastered, Spiritual Power condensed into a bright sun within the body, containing immense Spiritual Power.<br/><br/>Fang Wang began to cultivate.<br/><br/>This time, he could apply some understanding from the Heavenly Dao True Skill to practice the Great Celestial Infinite Scripture.<br/><br/>A hundred years later, he mastered the Great Celestial Infinite Scripture, and his Spiritual Power surged tenfold!<br/><br/>Three hundred years later, the Great Celestial Infinite Scripture reached the state of Great Completion, and his Spiritual Power was a hundred times greater than before his cultivation. Considering that his Spiritual Power hadn’t increased a hundredfold when he advanced from the Cross-Void Realm Ninth<br/><br/>Level to the Golden Body Realm First Level, the greatness of the Great Celestial<br/><br/>Infinite Scripture was evident.<br/><br/>Of course, the breakthrough in a major realm was primarily reflected in the enhancement of the nature of Spiritual Power, not merely the quantity of Spiritual Power.<br/><br/>Fang Wang forcefully suppressed his restlessness and continued to cultivate.<br/><br/>Once he cultivated the Great Celestial Infinite Scripture to Great Perfection, his Spiritual Power reached a thousand times that before cultivation, and the speed of its transformation far surpassed before. The nature’s spiritual energy needed to be converted into Spiritual Power by the Cultivation Technique, which took time.<br/><br/>A thousandfold increase in Spiritual Power meant that Fang Wang could extend the duration of a fight using his full strength by a thousand times!<br/><br/>This was truly terrifying!<br/><br/>Fang Wang’s lips trembled, and with difficulty, he opened his eyes and looked back.<br/><br/>About 1,100 years had passed!<br/><br/>With the Heavenly Palace environment shattered, Fang Wang returned to reality. He instinctively wanted to absorb the nature’s spiritual energy, but he restrained himself. He planned to return to the Mortal Realm and absorb the nature’s spiritual energy there.<br/><br/>Looking at the unfamiliar golden temple before him, Fang Wang was in a daze.<br/><br/>After entering the golden temple and practicing three Cultivation Techniques, he had spent nearly three thousand years!<br/><br/>Three thousand years! The strongest Great Cultivators in the Mortal Realm might not live for three thousand years!<br/><br/>Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable, had disappeared for a total of three thousand years!<br/><br/>Five thousand years ago, Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable, learned the Mountain River Town Heaven Fist in the Zhui Tian Secret Realm.<br/><br/>Fang Wang suspected that his actual age might have now surpassed Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable.<br/><br/>He took a deep breath and tried to calm his emotions.<br/><br/>He turned his head to look at the huge Golden Buddha. This time, he could clearly see the Buddha’s face. It was a face with an evil smile, a malevolent gaze, and a third eye open in the middle of its forehead.<br/><br/>At that moment, the Golden Buddha was staring right at Fang Wang, and that smile seemed as though it was looking at prey!<br/><br/>Fang Wang faced the Golden Buddha expressionlessly. The great hall was silent, with an air of murderous aura.<br/><br/>After a while,<br/><br/>Fang Wang broke the silence and said, “May I ask, Fo Ling, why don’t you show yourself?”<br/><br/>The Golden Buddha’s mouth moved slightly, and the smile grew even more gloomy and cruel.<br/><br/>After a few moments of silence, a voice arose, “Mortal, did you understand the<br/><br/>Buddhadharma on the pillar just now?”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
