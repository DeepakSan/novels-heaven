Of course, they could tell that Fang Wang was willing too, otherwise they would not dare keep Qu Xunhun.<br/><br/>Yang Du went to practice the True Combat Technique, Chu Yin went to practice the Solaris Scripture, Zhao Zhen continued to delve into the Shariputra, while Xiao Zi and Zhu Yan went to visit the monsters on the island.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, the various news about the internal trials of the Eternal Life Pavilion quickly spread across the seas, overshadowing the discussion trend triggered by the strange celestial phenomena.<br/><br/>Sword Sovereign of the Yellow Glyph Fang Wang executed Jiu You True Person, defeated Dry Wood True Person, and was promoted to Heavenly Dao True Person!<br/><br/>His combat achievements made all who heard them incredulous.<br/><br/>The gap between the twenty-four true persons and the Yellow Glyph Monarch was so vast, yet Fang Wang managed to defeat two true persons consecutively and even executed one of them.<br/><br/>It was unbelievably incredible!<br/><br/>Fang Wang once again became a hot topic among the sea regions of the Southern Celestial Sea, and he also earned a new title.<br/><br/>Tian Dao Fang Wang!<br/><br/>Provoked by those with ulterior motives, the two characters for true person were removed, and more and more cultivators directly addressed Fang Wang as Heavenly Dao, leading to the old predecessors from various forces coming forward to rebuke Fang Wang for violating the heavenly customs!<br/><br/>How could cultivators bear the title Heavenly Dao?<br/><br/>Inside an inn, a man and a woman sat across from each other at a wooden table by the window. Both were wearing bamboo hats and dressed in blue clothes; this man was none other than Fang Wang’s brother, Fang Xun.<br/><br/>The modern Fang Xun had undergone a complete transformation, his build very similar to Fang Wang, although his temperament was far from Fang Wang’s. Still, his aura as a strong person was evident.<br/><br/>The woman sitting opposite him had a beautiful demeanor and an aristocratic bearing typical of a family’s child.<br/><br/>“Have you heard? Tian Dao Fang Wang executed Jiu You True Person with a single sword strike and blew away Dry Wood True Person’s physical body with a punch, forcing Dry Wood True Person to kneel and beg for mercy!”<br/><br/>“I’ve heard too, it’s unbelievable, the Sword Sovereign of the Yellow Glyph actually possesses such strength.”<br/><br/>“The one who is strong isn’t the Sword Sovereign of the Yellow Glyph, but Fang Wang. He just used the title of the Sword Sovereign to enter the scene.”<br/><br/>“Zhu Yan, the seventh son of the royal family, serves as Fang Wang’s mount.<br/><br/>We initially thought it was ridiculous, but now it seems like the emperor made a smart move.<br/><br/>“I wonder how old Tian Dao Fang Wang is, is he qualified to compete for the title of the Southern Celestial Four Heroes?<br/><br/>Listening to the discussions among the cultivators around them, Fang Xun’s face revealed a smile, his eyes full of pride.<br/><br/>Fang Wang would always be his greatest pride; he had entered the path of cultivation to follow his brother’s footsteps.<br/><br/>The woman in blue looked at him and asked softly, “Are you really that related?”<br/><br/>Fang Xun swirled his wine bowl and chuckled, “When I told you before, his fame wasn’t as great, and you weren’t interested. Now that my brother has become famous, you’ve started to doubt me.”<br/><br/>The woman in blue said with emotion, “Judging from his performance, he already has the strength to sweep through the Mahayana Realm, but I remember you telling me your brother is only fifty-seven years older than you.”<br/><br/>Fang Xun’s smile grew even brighter as he said, “So you know who the true number one talent in this world is, right?”<br/><br/>The woman in blue followed up, “If that’s the case, why don’t we join your brother?”<br/><br/>Longing filled her eyes.<br/><br/>“No, that would disturb his peaceful cultivation. You should just come back with me to the sect, my sister-in-law will support our affair,” Fang Xun shook his head.<br/><br/>Upon hearing this, the woman in blue nodded slightly, her right hand unconsciously touching her lower abdomen.<br/><br/>After returning to Biyou Island, Fang Wang began to lead a leisurely life, fishing, sunbathing, teaching monsters, diving, and so on, quite at ease.<br/><br/>This kind of life continued for a year.<br/><br/>Until one day, someone came to visit him.<br/><br/>Upon hearing the other party’s voice, Fang Wang immediately took out his Biyou Jade Token and opened the Formation.<br/><br/>Soon, Zhou Xue in red clothes appeared before Fang Wang.<br/><br/>Looking at her, Fang Wang felt somewhat bewildered; it had been more than five thousand years since they last saw each other, and to him, Zhou Xue had changed greatly.<br/><br/>“Tian Dao Fang Wang, what’s the matter? After becoming famous across the seas, you don’t recognize your wife in need?”<br/><br/>Zhou Xue asked with a raised eyebrow and a smile. Her makeup was still exquisite, even somewhat flamboyant, with a red flame mark on her forehead, adding to her majesty.<br/><br/>Fang Wang smiled and said, “It’s just been too long since we’ve seen each other, I’ve missed you a little.”<br/><br/>“You missed me?”<br/><br/>“Mhm.”<br/><br/>“Pretending to believe you, I’ve already heard about you killing the Jiu You True Person. You really didn’t disappoint me. I heard he couldn’t withstand a single one of your strikes?”<br/><br/>Zhou Xue naturally steered the conversation, praising him.<br/><br/>Fang Wang humbly said, “He simply underestimated me.”<br/><br/>As they spoke, he raised his hand to signal Zhou Xue to walk with him into the island. Zhou Xue did not refuse, and they walked side by side. She then brought out an oil lamp with her right hand. Accompanied by the fluctuation of Spiritual Power emitted by the oil lamp, an invisible barrier formed around them, preventing the outside world from spying on them.<br/><br/>Along the way, Fang Wang recounted his experiences within the Eternal Life Pavilion’s trials, but he did not mention anything about the Netherworld.<br/><br/>Zhou Xue listened intently, occasionally glancing at Fang Wang with a peculiar<br/><br/>expression in her eyes.<br/><br/>En route, Zhou Xue caught a glimpse of Yang Du’s figure, but she was not surprised; she didn’t even ask questions and continued to listen to Fang Wang’s stories of the trials.<br/><br/>Eventually, they arrived inside a pavilion and closed the door for some private time.<br/><br/>Fang Wang took out a jug of fine wine and poured a cup for Zhou Xue. He smiled and said, “I got the Jiu You inheritance that the Jiu You True Person wanted. Do you want to learn it?”<br/><br/>Zhou Xue was moved and asked curiously, “Really?”<br/><br/>Fang Wang nodded and said, “I’ve learned the Jiuyou Zizaishu, Vajra Invincible Saint Body, Great Celestial Infinite Scripture, Great Vajra Mantra. Which one do you want to learn?”<br/><br/>Upon hearing this, Zhou Xue’s eyes took on a strange look as she murmured, “The Vajra Invincible Saint Body? I didn’t expect this technique to originate from the Mortal Realm.”<br/><br/>Fang Wang curiously asked, “What do you mean? Is this technique also found in The Upper Realm?”<br/><br/>Zhou Xue nodded, saying, “The Vajra Invincible Saint Body is even stronger than the Heavenly Body and exists in The Upper Realm. There’s a human clan with the Vajra Invincible Saint Body, and those who reach Great Completion with it can shake the suns of The Upper Realm, which is quite terrifying. However, I’ve never encountered it personally; I’ve only heard about its strength.”<br/><br/>Fang Wang quietly reflected. Could it be that descendants of the Grand An Divine Dynasty had survived and ascended to The Upper Realm after its destruction?<br/><br/>“The Vajra Invincible Saint Body doesn’t suit me, and you don’t need to teach me anything. I’ve already obtained quite a few powerful inheritances,” Zhou Xue said with a confident smile.<br/><br/>Fang Wang squinted and asked, “Was the celestial phenomenon earlier caused by you?”<br/><br/>Zhou Xue smiled candidly, “Yes, I created a piece of Immortal Law. Why? Do you want to learn it?”<br/><br/>Fang Wang shook his head and said, “I don’t want to learn it for now. I’ll find you later if I’m interested.”<br/><br/>He didn’t want to enter the Heavenly Palace anymore!<br/><br/>Fang Wang added, “Otherwise, let me teach you the Jiuyou Zizaishu. This technique is good for protecting your life, and it will be useful even after you ascend.”<br/><br/>Zhou Xue met his gaze, the atmosphere seeming to shift. She asked softly,<br/><br/>“What? Are you afraid of me dying?’<br/><br/>Fang Wang didn’t avoid the question and looked right at her, saying, “Indeed, I’m a bit afraid.’<br/><br/>Zhou Xue laughed and shook her head, “Kid, don’t fall for me. Even though I’m the same age as you, I’ve lived through two lives, I’ve lived far more years than you.”<br/><br/>Fang Wang’s lips curved upward as he replied, “Who hasn’t lived two lives? Besides, I simply don’t want anything bad to happen to you; it has nothing to do with feelings.”<br/><br/>In terms of actual age, he was also more than ten thousand years old, but the Heavenly Palace was his greatest secret, one he wouldn’t share with anyone, not even the closest of friends.<br/><br/>“Alright then, I’ll stay for a while longer and practice your Jiuyou Zizaishu. After all, it never hurts to have too many skills.” Zhou Xue smiled as she spoke, but her smile wasn’t as bright as before.<br/><br/>Fang Wang then asked, “You saw Yang Du, right? I took him under my wing; you don’t have any objections, do you?”<br/><br/>The first time he had heard the name Yang Du was from Zhou Xue’s mouth. Zhou Xue had cautioned him never to provoke Yang Du.<br/><br/>Zhou Xue took a sip of wine and said, “Of course, I have no objections. It actually suits me quite well.”<br/><br/>“Why? Didn’t you tell me not to provoke him?”<br/><br/>“It was just reverse psychology. Back in Grand Qi, I also told you not to provoke certain people, but it seemed to have no effect. And the attitude Xu Qiuming had towards you gave me other ideas. I wanted to see if you could win over Yang Du.”<br/><br/>Fang Wang frowned, not quite understanding.<br/><br/>Zhou Xue smiled and said, “I’ve noticed you’re different from other Cultivators. Despite your decisive killing, deep down, you still have a spirit of chivalry. Xu Qiuming was saved by you, and now wherever he goes, he spreads your fame. So I wanted to see if you could win the heart of Yang Du. And if you couldn’t, then let Yang Du serve as your whetstone.”<br/><br/>Fang Wang was speechless, realizing he had been played.<br/><br/>However, Zhou Xue’s scheming was not malicious, and naturally, he wasn’t angry.<br/><br/>He asked curiously, “You want me to win him over because he possesses the<br/><br/>Heavenly Body? Did he ascend in his past life?”<br/><br/>Zhou Xue put down her wine cup, saying with emotion, “Yang Du didn’t ascend, but when he was alive, he was stronger than those who did. To be precise, the Ascenders managed to ascend by killing him, acquiring the opportunity to ascend.”<br/><br/>Fang Wang’s interest was piqued, and he fixed his gaze on Zhou Xue.<br/><br/>Zhou Xue continued, “In his previous life, once Yang Du entered the Nirvana Realm, the domineering power of the Heavenly Body was fully activated. He dominated the Seven Seas and Fifteen Continents, climbing over heaps of bones to become the most powerful person in the Mortal Realm. His goal was to attain the position of Great Saint. When no Great Saint appeared, he truly was the strongest at the time. Because of his many evil deeds, he became a calamity for the Mortal Realm, and various forces banded together to besiege him, including myself in that great battle.”<br/><br/>“Apart from Xu Qiuming and the exceptional prodigy with the Nine Lives<br/><br/>Precious Spirit, nobody could stand against Yang Du head-on. That was until Ji Rutian appeared. Ji Rutian had once saved Yang Du’s life a long time ago; the two were close friends. Yang Du could not bring himself to kill him and spared Ji Rutian’s life repeatedly, ultimately being outsmarted by Ji Rutian and dying in an ancient Formation.”<br/><br/>“Yang Du’s strength is beyond doubt. His downfall was merely because he was too sentimental. Honestly, if Yang Du had taken a different path and ascended, I can’t even imagine how high his achievements might have been..”\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
