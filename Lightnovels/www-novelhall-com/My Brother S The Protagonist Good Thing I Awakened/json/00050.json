It is our turn now.\"<br/><br/>\"Hehe! I had finally understood 30% of Heavenly Emperor's Sword. I can't wait to showcase my power.\"<br/><br/>\"Stupid! Do you think that with your meager strength, you would be chosen? Obviously, someone like me should be the one to represent our clan.\"<br/><br/>\"I heard there are a lot of attractive prizes for the winner. Maybe I could win some for our clan!\"<br/><br/>They were mostly excited about this event as previously they had no chance to participate. However, This time it was their chance to showcase their power and talent.<br/><br/>There was also a spark of competitiveness in their eyes, each one eager to be chosen for the chance to participate and stand out.<br/><br/>Feng Chen raised his hand, commanding attention.<br/><br/>\"Ahem! Calm down, everyone. We are not merely going to participate; we must make a strong impression.\"<br/><br/>The room quieted as they turned their focus to Feng Chen.<br/><br/>\"The Eastern Gathering is more than just a competition between clans of the Eastern Region. It's a way for the clan to expand their influence and domination.\" Feng Chen continued.<br/><br/>\"We need to not only compete but stand out, showing that the Feng Clan is a force to be reckoned with. Our performance will influence our standing in the region, and it will also affect how other clans and influential figures perceive us.\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen's gaze hardened as he spoke.<br/><br/>\"We are here to make a mark and to secure our place among the top contenders. This is an opportunity to solidify our position as one of the strongest clans in the Eastern Prefecture. We cannot afford to be anything less than exceptional.\"<br/><br/>The clan members nodded at Feng Chen's words, fully understanding the significance of the upcoming competition.<br/><br/>This was their chance to prove that their recently ascended clan wasn't just another weakling among the powerhouses.<br/><br/>By performing exceptionally in the Eastern Gathering, they would be able to establish their clan's dominance, secure influential alliances, and solidify their position as a formidable force in the Eastern Region.<br/><br/>Although many were feeling confident due to their recent increase in their cultivation, they knew not to underestimate their enemies.<br/><br/>Misty Vale City was one of the lowest ranking in the Eastern Region. They might be the strongest in the Misty Vale City, but they know that their opponents are stronger.<br/><br/>To truly support their clan, they knew they needed to push their own limits and grow even stronger. Their determination hardened, fueling their resolve to contribute as much as they could to the clan's success.<br/><br/>Feng Chen surveyed the expressions of the clan members and felt a sense of satisfaction.<br/><br/>Compared to before, their faces now reflected a steely resolve and determination, even in the face of adversity.<br/><br/>\"You've probably seen the new building that's been recently constructed in the western courtyard.\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen said.<br/><br/>The clan members exchanged curious glances. They had indeed noticed the large building for the first time but didn't think it was weird.<br/><br/>Although some wonder just where the building appeared out of nowhere since they were mostly cultivating, they felt perhaps at that time, their clan was doing some construction.<br/><br/>However, even those who weren't in close-door cultivation were seeing the building for the first time.<br/><br/>Feng Chen continued, \"That building is not just for show. It is the Astral Training Pavilion. It is a grand, self-contained training realm designed to push your limits. Inside, you'll find a vast, ever-changing environment that includes towering training arenas, dense forests for survival training, and expansive battlefields where you can engage in combat without any risk to your lives.\"<br/><br/>The clan members stared in disbelief, their eyes wide with amazement.<br/><br/>\"Does a training realm like that exist? I have never heard about an artifact like this!\"<br/><br/>\"I heard that some of the powerful sects have something like this. This is one of the reasons<br/><br/>why Cultivators want to join a sect like Mystic Flame Sect.\"<br/><br/>\"Is this for real? Can we really train inside this artifact?\"<br/><br/>\"Family master has said so then it must be true. I can't wait to try out the techniques.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, I was thinking about going to the Mountains and practicing with the monsters. But it seems like there is no need to take such a risk.\"<br/><br/>Their conversations buzzed with a mix of disbelief and enthusiasm as they processed the<br/><br/>news.<br/><br/>The prospect of such a powerful training tool invigorated them, turning their skepticism into eager anticipation.<br/><br/>They might not have believed that they got such an incredible artifact if it was someone else. However, since it was Feng Chen who said so, they naturally believed it.<br/><br/>They<br/><br/>Feng<br/><br/>words were akin to that of god.<br/><br/>\"You can refine your skills in various environments, challenge yourself with simulated opponents, and even undergo soul-enhancing trials. It's an invaluable tool for preparing for<br/><br/>the Eastern Gathering.\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen continued.<br/><br/>He brought the Astral Training Pavilion from the System Shop.<br/><br/>************<br/><br/>Astral Training Pavilion:<br/><br/>Description: The Astral Training Pavilion is a Heaven-Grade Artifact that creates a virtual world for training and combat. Within this realm, participants can engage in simulated battles and various learning scenarios without the risk of real death.<br/><br/>Advantage: Provides a safe environment for intense combat training and skill refinement. Enables users to experience and overcome challenging scenarios without physical harm. Training in the pavilion helps improve combat skills and strategic thinking while managing<br/><br/>energy and recovery effectively.<br/><br/>It can improve Soul Power.<br/><br/>Disadvantage: While virtual deaths do not cause actual harm, they will exhaust the user's soul power and Qi. As a result, a participant cannot re-enter the pavilion on the same day after<br/><br/>dying.<br/><br/>Cost: 100,000 System Points<br/><br/>************<br/><br/>(Great! I am now officially poor!)<br/><br/>Feng Chen thought as he fought back the tears.<br/><br/>The System Points he had painstakingly collected were nearly exhausted after purchasing this<br/><br/>artifact.<br/><br/>Yet, despite the cost, Feng Chen knew it was essential for his clan's advancement. The price was steep, but the value of such an artifact was immeasurable to his clan.<br/><br/>In a battle between opponents of equal strength, who has the advantage? Is it the one with superior artifacts or the one with more advanced techniques?<br/><br/>No, it's the experience that makes all the difference.<br/><br/>Even the strongest techniques are useless if you can't anticipate your opponent's moves or<br/><br/>time your actions perfectly.<br/><br/>Experience allows you to read the flow of combat, adapt to unforeseen challenges, and seize<br/><br/>the right moments.<br/><br/>Thus, fighting experience is as crucial as cultivation itself.<br/><br/>Therefore, although the cost of the Astral Training Pavilion was very high to the point that<br/><br/>Feng Chen was only left with 50,000 System Points, he felt that it was necessary for the future development of the Clan.<br/><br/>Of course, there was another reason as to why he was willing to invest so much System Point in the Astral Training Pavillion.<br/><br/>[Mission: Rank among Top-3 in the Eastern Region in the upcoming Easter Gathering and show your dominance! ]<br/><br/>[Rewards: 100,000 System Points and ??? depending on the result.]<br/><br/>If he couldn't complete the System mission, the point he invested would naturally be earned back. Moreover, there was a possibility of getting even greater rewards. seaʀᴄh thё Novelƒire(.)ne*t website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>So, with the purchase of the Astral Training Pavillion, not only could he strengthen the clan to<br/><br/>rank high in the Eastern Gathering but also got more rewards.<br/><br/>However, if he fails then both the reward and his investment might turn into waste.<br/><br/>However, Feng Chen never considered the possibility of failure. Not since he was also going to<br/><br/>cultivate harder and raise his Realm.<br/><br/>By then he was sure that even if something unforeseen happens, he could manage it and win<br/><br/>back the System Points that he invested.<br/><br/>\"Hehe! No one will stand in my way to become richer!\"\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
