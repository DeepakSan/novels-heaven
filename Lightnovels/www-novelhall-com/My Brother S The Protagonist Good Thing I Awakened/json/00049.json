After all, the power of a clan is not only judged by the Clan's strongest but also by their potential which is shown by the younger generations.<br/><br/>This assembly was more than just a formal gathering; it was a significant occasion that shaped the political and economic landscape of the Eastern Region.<br/><br/>The assembly served several key purposes. Firstly, it was a platform for the strongest clans of the city to present their strength and influence.<br/><br/>Each clan used the opportunity to showcase their power, potential, and alliances. This display was crucial, as it allowed clans to assert their dominance and secure their positions within the region.<br/><br/>Secondly, the assembly was a venue for high-stakes negotiations and alliance-building. Clans that had previously been rivals might find common ground, while others could forge new partnerships or settle long-standing disputes.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the assembly ranks each clan based on their demonstrated power. These rankings influence the amount of resources allocated to each city, which can significantly impact their economic and strategic advantages.<br/><br/>Finally, the rankings from this gathering are closely watched by the Imperial Family and major sects.<br/><br/>Participants who display exceptional power or talent may attract the attention of these influential entities, potentially leading to recruitment opportunities.<br/><br/>For clans looking to forge connections with powerful backers, this assembly presents a valuable chance to secure influential alliances.<br/><br/>\"Previously, the Yan Clan had attended the Eastern Gathering as they were the most powerful clan in Misty Vale City. However, now that your clan has taken their place, it will be your responsibility to represent the city at the upcoming event.\"<br/><br/>Wang Yifan said.<br/><br/>In a sense, the Wang Clan could be said to be the strongest before Feng Clan rise. But it was Yan Clan who would go to attend this gathering.<br/><br/>As Wang Clan was appointed by the Imperial Family, even if they were the strongest, they were not allowed to participate.<br/><br/>Consequently, with the other three major clans having been eliminated, the Feng Clan was now the sole eligible contender from Misty Vale City.<br/><br/>Misty Vale City's standing in the Eastern Region was relatively low, largely due to its lack of a cultivator at the Three Elements Divine Realm.<br/><br/>While the city was not at the bottom of the rankings, it still struggled to compete with many of the more powerful clans that had Three Elements Divine Realm cultivators.<br/><br/>Moreover, Misty Vale City also faced a shortage of genius-level talents, which further hindered its ability to rise in the ranks.<br/><br/>Some of the clans that participated in the gathering included personal disciples of powerful sects, whose abilities far surpassed those of the Yan Clan's geniuses.<br/><br/>The combination of these factors had kept Misty Vale City from achieving prominence in the Eastern Region.<br/><br/>\"Eastern region Gathering! So, it was this year.\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen didn't really pay attention to it because although it somewhat affected them but Yan Family were the one to always go.<br/><br/>Moreover, there was no benefit nor much loss as the Yan Family would always be at the bottom. Whether Yan Family went or not didn't change much for the Misty Vale City. S~eaʀᴄh the Nôvel(F)ire.ηet website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>Therefore, Feng Chen has almost forgotten about it.<br/><br/>\"Yes! It will be in about three months and I wanted to remind you just in case you were unaware.\"<br/><br/>Wang Yifan said. Since Yan Clan was the one always participating from Misty Vale City, he thought that Feng Chen wouldn't know.<br/><br/>\"With you and your brother's power, I think that our city will have quite a high ranking this time!\"<br/><br/>Wang Yifan added.<br/><br/>Previously, he didn't have much hope because the strongest from Yan Clan was only at Mid- Level Grand Qi Condensation Realm which is not nearly enough to compete for top spot.<br/><br/>But Feng Chen was not only in Three Elements Divine Realm but has shown enough capability to even kill Mid-Level Three Elements Divine Realm Cultivators.<br/><br/>This power was enough to be hailed as one of the strongest in the Easter Prefecture. Which is one of the reasons why the Third Prince thought of supporting the Feng Clan.<br/><br/>And Feng Yun and Feng Mei were reported to have battled against cultivators at the Five Core Formation Stage, comparable to some of the most talented individuals from the major sects.<br/><br/>There were also Feng Xiaoyu, Feng Jianhong, and Feng Liang who have shown incredible talent in the Annual Genius Competition.<br/><br/>With such a lineup, Wang Yifan was sure that Feng Clan would achieve a great result in the upcoming Eastern Gathering.<br/><br/>Although this sentiment was not shared by Feng Chen.<br/><br/>He frowned upon hearing that he would need to attend the Eastern Gathering. If he could, he would have avoided it, however, he knows that it will only antagonize various clans, sect and<br/><br/>even the Imperial Family.<br/><br/>(What a bad luck!)<br/><br/>Feng Chen thought.<br/><br/>Although getting a high rank might help the Feng Clan as they would have to pay less tax and would get more resources, it wasn't a very great time for Feng Clan to participate.<br/><br/>Feng Chen had refused the Third Prince's proposal, however, there must have been many other clans from Eastern Prefecture who had received similar offers from the Third Prince.<br/><br/>And it is obvious that those clans would be against the Feng Clan who has refused the offer. The Third Prince himself might even order them to eliminate the Feng Clan.<br/><br/>Feng Chen thought that he would quietly consolidate his power in Misty Vale City but that dream might not be as easy to achieve as he thought.<br/><br/>(It seems I must push both myself and my clan to elevate our cultivation!)<br/><br/>Feng Chen's gaze hardened as he continued his thoughts.<br/><br/>In a world as chaotic as this, where the Emperor's health was uncertain and various sects were vying to assert their dominance, the Feng Clan had no choice but to grow stronger if they<br/><br/>wished to survive.<br/><br/>The instability in the capital meant that power dynamics were constantly shifting, and the rise of one faction often came at the expense of another.<br/><br/>The Eastern Assembly would be a critical test, not just for showcasing their strength but for solidifying their position amidst the turmoil.<br/><br/>The sects and clans from across the Eastern Prefecture would be eager to demonstrate their own prowess and secure their future by aligning with the most influential factions, including those princes and princesses.<br/><br/>\"Good! I would also like to see how my clan fares against others in Eastern Prefecture!\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen said. Although there were a lot of things that were against his plan and were<br/><br/>disadvantageous to him.<br/><br/>He felt that this was also an opportunity for him and his clan to improve themselves.<br/><br/>It is said that only in the face of danger does one's potential come out.<br/><br/>(I've always preferred playing it safe, but looking at the way things were unfolding, it was clear that I no longer had that luxury.)<br/><br/>The reason for hiding his power and not eliminating his enemies earlier were also due to that.<br/><br/>He has read enough novels to know that once weak enemies are killed, you would need to face<br/><br/>harder enemies.<br/><br/>This is exactly what was happening to him right now.<br/><br/>He has eliminated the Other Three Major Families and two Elder Zhou who threatened his<br/><br/>family, however, in the progress has made a lot of enemies.<br/><br/>But he didn't regret it!<br/><br/>Given the circumstances, it didn't seem like I could simply avoid getting drawn into<br/><br/>confrontation.<br/><br/>Just like the Third Prince coming to offer him to be his subordinate, there will be many more<br/><br/>once his strength is known.<br/><br/>\"Well, there's no turning back now,\" Feng Chen muttered to himself.<br/><br/>\"If we're to rise, we'll have to face whatever comes our way head-on.\"<br/><br/>He couldn't hide his power for much longer since the enemy he will be facing now would<br/><br/>definitely be stronger.<br/><br/>Moreover, he wanted to strengthen his clan. And that will obviously not go unnoticed by other<br/><br/>people.<br/><br/>Since that was going to happen anyways, Feng Chen decided to use the upcoming Eastern Assembly not only to display his full power but also to provide his clan's younger generation with the opportunity to broaden their horizons and witness the vastness of the world.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
