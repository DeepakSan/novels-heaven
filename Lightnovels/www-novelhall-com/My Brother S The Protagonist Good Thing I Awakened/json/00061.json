The wide road, spanning ten feet across, was crowded with caravans rolling in from every direction.<br/><br/>Onlookers lined both sides of the street, their eyes filled with curiosity and anticipation.<br/><br/>This time the Eastern Gathering was going to be held at Tianlong Mansion, one of the Top Clan in the Eastern Region situated in Qingyun City.<br/><br/>Qingyun City was a sprawling metropolis nestled in a land blessed with abundant natural<br/><br/>resources.<br/><br/>Unlike Misty Vale City, which was relatively modest in scale, Qingyun City's vastness was reflected not only in its population but also in its wealth, far surpassing that of its smaller counterpart.<br/><br/>Rich veins of rare minerals, spiritual stones, and precious ores lay beneath the surface of the region, making Qingyun a hub for cultivators and merchants seeking to purchase materials for weapons, armor, and alchemical concoctions.<br/><br/>The mountains surrounding the city were dotted with large mining operations, each extracting valuable resources that attracted powerful sects and clans from across the Eastern Region.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Qingyun's fertile lands stretched across vast plains, fed by the region's rivers, which were said to be enriched by traces of spiritual energy.<br/><br/>These lands yielded not just common crops, but rare medicinal herbs and spirit plants, some of which were ingredients in high-grade alchemical pills.<br/><br/>In Qingyun, it wasn't uncommon to find such herbs growing in abundance, harvested by powerful sects or even small local clans who had staked claims on the land centuries ago.<br/><br/>In addition to its agricultural and mineral wealth, Qingyun City's strategic position as a central hub for trade and commerce made it a vibrant center of economic activity.<br/><br/>Nestled between key regions, it served as a vital crossroads for merchants traveling to and from the capital.<br/><br/>This central location allowed for efficient trade routes, connecting the city to various provinces and facilitating the movement of goods, resources, and information.<br/><br/>Merchants flocked to Qingyun City to take advantage of its bustling markets, where they could exchange everything from rare herbs and minerals to powerful artifacts and alchemical ingredients.<br/><br/>The city's proximity to the capital also meant that influential figures and powerful sects frequently visited, eager to establish connections and alliances, further boosting its economic prominence.<br/><br/>This economic prosperity not only attracted cultivators in search of resources but also provided the city's residents with access to higher-tier cultivation materials and pills.<br/><br/>In contrast to Misty Vale City, where rank 2 pills were considered rare treasures, in Qingyun City, such pills were sold in almost every shop, and even higher-grade pills were available to those with enough wealth or influence.<br/><br/>Although Rank 3 Pills remained uncommon, Qingyun's Alchemists were known to produce them more frequently, making the city an important stop for those seeking high-grade pills. Compared to Misty Vale City situated in a remote area, Qingyun City was a vast and wealthy -city.<br/><br/>Today, the city's inhabitants were buzzing with excitement since it was the day of the Eastern Gathering.<br/><br/>The Eastern Gathering was not only an opportunity for the auction house and other businesses to make money but also for the people to meet those powerful clans from other cities including Feng Chen.<br/><br/>Feng Chen's fame had spread far and wide due to his remarkable achievements, and many were eager to see the young clan leader who led his clan to prominence.<br/><br/>\"The head of Feng Clan, Feng Chen is said to be the participant from Misty Vale City.\"<br/><br/>\"Naturally, it should be him. He has eliminated all other Major Clan in that city.\"<br/><br/>\"Hey, Hey! Don't make him sound like a villain. They were the ones targeting the Feng Clan and had failed. Moreover, they dare to bring in an outsider in their city's affairs.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah, those Trashy Elders from Zhou Clan. Can't they keep their head to where they belong? Unnecessary going to another city to get killed. Tsk Tsk! They deserved such an ending!\" \"Anyway, I am curious to know whether Feng Chen is stronger or our Tianlong leader?\"<br/><br/>\"Obviously, it is Tianlong Leader!\"...<br/><br/>Clearly, while Feng Chen had recently gained fame, his reputation lacked the solid foundation built over the years by other clan leaders.<br/><br/>Unlike them, who had established themselves through consistent achievements and S~eaʀᴄh the novёlF~ire.net website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>influence, Feng Chen's rise was swift and largely untested.<br/><br/>And it was not only those older guys that people were curious about but also those young geniuses who had started to make a name for themselves.<br/><br/>Feng Yun also drew considerable attention, mostly because of his status as the ex-fiance of Ling Meiyu, particularly from the young geniuses.<br/><br/>\"Hey, seems like we're about to cross paths with Ling Meiyu's ex-fiancé,\" Hu Lian said, a sly smile curling at the edge of her lips.<br/><br/>Beside her, Yuan Ziyan snorted in disdain.<br/><br/>\"Hmph! I'll make sure he knows who he messed with. A guy like him? Trash like that isn't<br/><br/>even close to being worthy of our Junior Sister Meiyu.\"<br/><br/>Hu Lian and Yuan Ziyan were also disciples of the Mystic Flame Sect and had come to Qingyun City because her family was participating in the Eastern Gathering.<br/><br/>Obviously, since Yuan Ziyan belongs to the Mystic Flame Sect, she doesn't have good feelings about Feng Yun and considers him to be a man who has tarnished her junior sister's reputation by divorcing her.<br/><br/>\"Come on, Sis,\" chimed in Yuan Ling. He raised an eyebrow at Liu Ziyan.<br/><br/>\"You shouldn't call him 'trash.' Didn't you hear? He's already broken through to the Peak Foundation Establishment Stage.\"<br/><br/>Although he could understand why his sister didn't like Feng Yun, that didn't mean that he was going to allow Yuan Ziyan to make such ignorant remarks.<br/><br/>Even if one doesn't like others, fact is a fact. And the fact is that Feng Yun is no longer 'Trash' and could be considered to have quite a remarkable talent for cultivating the Peak Foundation Establishment Stage at age 16.<br/><br/>He thought that no matter what, one should know how to acknowledge the truth. And he was disappointed about her sister who is letting her emotion speak over the truth.<br/><br/>Yuan Ziyan clicked her tongue.<br/><br/>\"Peak Foundation Establishment Stage? So what? He's still nothing compared to our Junior<br/><br/>Sister or any of us.\"<br/><br/>Yuan Ziyan said with her mouth of disdain.<br/><br/>Seeing her ignorant sister, Yuan Ling just shook his head. He didn't want to continue this nonsensical talk and changed the topic.<br/><br/>\"Apart from you, which Sect's inner disciple is going to participate?\"<br/><br/>Yuan Ling asked.<br/><br/>In this gathering, the ones who should be potential opponents of him were either the heirs of<br/><br/>the clan or those clan members who were sent to the Sect and became their inner disciples.<br/><br/>Many powerful clans choose to send their children to powerful sects because those powerful sects have many resources that are incomparable to a clan.<br/><br/>Of course, there were also many like him who chose to practice in their clan.<br/><br/>\"There is one from Spirit Wind Palace. I think he is one of the inner disciples and also a<br/><br/>member of the Tianlong Clan.\"<br/><br/>Hu Lian replied.<br/><br/>Getting news was relatively easy on the Mystic Flame Sect and that included information<br/><br/>about other sects.<br/><br/>\"Spirit Wind Palace? That's impressive. Do you know his name?\"<br/><br/>Yuan Ling inquired, intrigued. As one knows, Spirit Wind Palace is also a Top Sect, and<br/><br/>becoming their inner disciple was by no means easy.<br/><br/>Hu Lian nodded.<br/><br/>\"His name is Tianlong Yu. He's known for his speed and agility in battle. They say he has a<br/><br/>natural affinity for wind-based techniques.\"<br/><br/>Yuan Ziyan scoffed.<br/><br/>\"Speed is nothing without strength. He can only be considered a second-rated fighter!\"<br/><br/>Yuan Ziyan remarked. Although she sounded arrogant, it was because she had already defeated this guy at the sect competition before and didn't think he was a worthy opponent.<br/><br/>Of course, in this Eastern Gathering, the Top Clan favorite to win was the Yuan Clan with Yuan Ling and Yuan Ziyan as two of their participants.<br/><br/>For Yuan Ziyan who is a disciple of the Sect Master of Mystic Flame Sect, almost no one was her opponent in Eastern Gathering.<br/><br/>\"There's also Xuanyuan Feng from the Iron Fist Sect. They say he has been training in the sect's sacred grounds,\" Hu Lian continued, her eyes lighting up with excitement. \"Xuanyuan Feng? I've heard of him. He's quite a powerhouse, but I wonder if he can last 10<br/><br/>moves against me?\"<br/><br/>Yuan Ling mused.<br/><br/>\"Oh, and don't forget about Yunhai Mei from the Yunhai Clan. She's an extraordinary<br/><br/>alchemist and a rising star among the younger generation.\"<br/><br/>Yuan Ziyan rolled her eyes. \"Alchemists are useful, but they're not warriors. What's the point of being able to make pills<br/><br/>if you can't defend yourself?\"<br/><br/>\"True, but she is also known to possess special mind techniques, and opponents are defeated<br/><br/>before they know what has happened. I heard our elders were quite eager to recruit her.\"<br/><br/>Hu Lian pointed out.<br/><br/>\"Whatever,\" Yuan Ziyan huffed, still unimpressed.<br/><br/>\"I'm more interested in seeing how Feng Yun handles them. If he can't even win against those<br/><br/>people then he can forget defeating Junior Sister Meiyu.\"<br/><br/>\"... I'm curious too. Will Feng Yun rise to the challenge or be swept away by them?\"\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
