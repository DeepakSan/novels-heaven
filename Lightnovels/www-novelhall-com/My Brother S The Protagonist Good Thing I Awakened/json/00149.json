CLANK! <br/><br/>Moments later, as he soared over a dense forest at the base of the gorge, the distant sounds of battle reached his ears. <br/><br/>Screams, roars, and the clash of steel against something far tougher reverberated through the trees. <br/><br/>Feng Chen's brows furrowed. <br/><br/>\"Is someone fighting?\" <br/><br/>He adjusted his trajectory, heading toward the commotion. <br/><br/>As he descended, the scene became clear. <br/><br/>A group of about a dozen people was under attack by a massive Rank-5 monster. <br/><br/>The beast was a Scarlet Horned Direwolf, its crimson mane and sharp, curving horns exuding a terrifying aura. <br/><br/>The guards, clearly dressed as mercenaries, had formed a defensive formation. <br/><br/>They were holding their ground but barely—several were wounded, and their breathing was labored. <br/><br/>At the center of the group, a young girl stood clutching a jade pendant.  Sёarch* The Nôvel(F)ire.nёt website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>Her pale face betrayed fear, but her eyes gleamed with defiance. <br/><br/>Feng Chen didn't know who she was, but looking at her dress and demeanor, it was clear she was some child of a noble. <br/><br/>Her cultivation wasn't bad either, being in the Grand Qi Condensation Realm. <br/><br/>Although Feng Chen didn't know why someone like her would be in such a place. <br/><br/>( Does she have a relative working as a guard at the border? ) <br/><br/>Feng Chen could only think of this. After all, the only people who would be here would be those going to visit the border. <br/><br/>\"Protect the young miss at all costs!\" <br/><br/>Shouted the leader of the guards, a tall woman with sharp, battle-hardened features. <br/><br/>Her armor was scratched and dented, but her commanding voice carried the weight of someone with authority. <br/><br/>Her black hair, tied tightly into a braid, swayed with every movement. <br/><br/>\"Three Elements Divine Realm cultivator? It seems like the identity of the girl is indeed not simple.\" <br/><br/>Feng Chen muttered as he observed. <br/><br/>Although the guards were dressed like mercenaries, it was clear that this was to deceive others. <br/><br/>There was no way a Three Elements Divine Realm cultivator would actually work as a mercenary. <br/><br/>Even if one were initially just a mercenary, the moment they reached the Three Elements Divine Realm, countless clans and even the Royal Family would extend invitations to join them, offering vast benefits. <br/><br/>\"Which clan has such a princess? Sending a Three Elements Divine Realm cultivator and several Grand Qi Condensation Realm experts as guards. Though it seems the monster they are facing is out of their league.\" <br/><br/>The Scarlet Horned Direwolf, though a Rank-5 Monster, was considered one of the most powerful of its rank. <br/><br/>Even a top Three Elements Divine Realm cultivator would avoid confronting it unless absolutely necessary, and Captain Hua was only in the Early Stage of the Three Elements Divine Realm. <br/><br/>Even with the help of others, it would be hard for her to defeat such a monster. <br/><br/>Judging by the state of the guards, they were clearly struggling, with a couple of guards already dead. <br/><br/>\"Defend!\" <br/><br/>Captain Hua commanded. <br/><br/>The Direwolf lunged forward, its claws tearing through one of the guards' defenses with ease, sending him flying into a tree. <br/><br/>No matter what, it seems like their tactics wouldn't work on such a powerful monster and the only thing they could do to survive is escape. <br/><br/>\"This beast is too strong! Fall back and regroup!\" <br/><br/>But before they could retreat, the Direwolf howled, and the surrounding air seemed to ignite with its qi, creating a barrier that trapped them. <br/><br/>Captain Hua gritted her teeth as she adjusted her grip on her halberd. <br/><br/>Her sharp eyes scanned the scene, weighing their options in the face of the overwhelming odds. <br/><br/>Turning to her most trusted subordinate, she gave an urgent command. <br/><br/>\"Liu Cheng! Take the princess and get out of here! The rest of us will hold the beast off!\" <br/><br/>Liu Cheng, a lean man with sharp features, hesitated. <br/><br/>\"Captain Hua, I—\" <br/><br/>\"No arguments!\" <br/><br/>Captain Hua interrupted sharply, her tone leaving no room for defiance. <br/><br/>Her gaze softened briefly as she looked at the young girl. <br/><br/>\"Our duty is to protect her, no matter the cost. You're the fastest among us. Take her and run!\" <br/><br/>The young girl, clutching her jade pendant tightly, stepped forward, her voice trembling yet resolute. <br/><br/>\"No! I won't leave you all behind! We can fight it together!\" <br/><br/>Captain Hua knelt slightly to meet the girl's gaze, her voice steady and reassuring despite the chaos around them. <br/><br/>\"Wang'er, your life is worth more than ours. If we can buy you even a moment to escape, then our sacrifice will not be in vain.\" <br/><br/>The girl's eyes filled with tears, but she didn't look away from the captain. <br/><br/>\"But—\" <br/><br/>\"No buts!\" <br/><br/>Captain Hua said firmly, standing upright again and gripping her halberd tightly. <br/><br/>\"Your father entrusted you to me, and I swore to protect you with my life. Let me keep that promise.\" <br/><br/>Liu Cheng placed a firm hand on the girl's shoulder. <br/><br/>\"The captain is right. We must at least ensure you are safe.\" <br/><br/>She hesitated for a moment, clutching her jade pendant tighter, and suddenly her gaze shifted. <br/><br/>Her wide eyes locked on a figure in the distance—a man hovering silently in the tree, watching them. <br/><br/>\"Wait!\" <br/><br/>She cried, her voice cutting through the chaos. <br/><br/>\"There's someone there!\" <br/><br/>Captain Hua whipped her head around, following Wang'er's line of sight. Her sharp eyes narrowed, but she saw nothing. <br/><br/>\"Wang'er, what are you talking about?\" <br/><br/>Captain Hua's tone was urgent but confused. <br/><br/>\"I can see him,\" Wang'er insisted, her voice trembling. <br/><br/>\"He's there, watching us!\" <br/><br/>Feng Chen's brows furrowed in surprise as he observed the scene. <br/><br/>( How did she notice me? Even a cultivator at the Three Elements Divine Realm wouldn't detect me unless I wanted them to. This girl is only in the Grand Qi Condensation Realm... Something's strange about her. ) <br/><br/>\"Eyes Of Insight!\" <br/><br/>**************** <br/><br/>Name: Wang Zhiqing <br/><br/>Cultivation Level: Top Grand Qi Condensation Realm <br/><br/>Talent: Above Average Talent <br/><br/>Physique: Mystic Eyes <br/><br/>**************** <br/><br/>Mystic Eyes is a rare and extraordinary physique that grants the wielder an unparalleled ability to perceive the hidden and the unseen. <br/><br/>\"So that's how!\" <br/><br/>Feng Chen understood that it was her special physique that allowed her to see him. <br/><br/>However, more than her physique, her name caught his attention. <br/><br/>\"Wang Zhiqing!\"\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
