Feng Mei collapsed onto the steps, her hands catching her just before she completely fell.<br/><br/>Blood spilled from her lips, soaking into the stone beneath her.<br/><br/>\"Hah... Hah...\"<br/><br/>She gasped for breath, her chest burning as though her very lungs were on fire.<br/><br/>\"Mei'er- ...\"<br/><br/>For a moment, everything went silent. She seemed to have heard Feng Yun shouting her name but that too disappeared.<br/><br/>The world around her faded into nothingness as her vision darkened.<br/><br/>(Is this it?)<br/><br/>Feng Mei thought to herself as her unconsciousness chipped away. She thought she could do it, only to be proven wrong.<br/><br/>Just as Feng Mei's vision began to fade into oblivion, a sudden warmth enveloped her.<br/><br/>It was soft at first, like the gentle touch of a hand pulling her back from the brink of unconsciousness.<br/><br/>Then, in the midst of the suffocating darkness, a brilliant light flickered before her eyes.<br/><br/>At first, it was a distant glow, almost imperceptible, but it grew brighter, more radiant until it illuminated the entire void around her. And then, emerging from the light, she saw it. (What-)<br/><br/>A majestic phoenix!<br/><br/>But it wasn't like any phoenix she had ever read about or imagined.<br/><br/>Its feathers shimmered with a translucent jade-like quality, glistening as though carved from the purest gemstone.<br/><br/>Its body radiated a cool, emerald glow that seemed to soothe her pain, yet the energy it emanated was fierce and untamed.<br/><br/>The jade phoenix's eyes, deep and ancient, locked onto her. They were filled with profound wisdom as if they had seen countless lifetimes.<br/><br/>Feng Mei stared back, entranced by the creature's beauty and the undeniable power it exuded.<br/><br/>Though the sight of such an ancient creature should have filled her with fear, Feng Mei felt<br/><br/>none.<br/><br/>Instead, a strange sense of familiarity washed over her, as if she had known the phoenix for a long time.<br/><br/>It was a strange feeling at the same time, it felt natural.<br/><br/>She couldn't look away from the phoenix and stared at it for a long time.<br/><br/>After a while, the phoenix spread its massive wings, and with a single, graceful movement, it descended toward her.<br/><br/>Its wings beat with a rhythm that felt like the heartbeat of the earth itself, a steady, powerful pulse that reverberated through Feng Mei's soul.<br/><br/>As it drew closer, the warmth around her grew, but it wasn't stifling like the pressure of the steps.<br/><br/>The phoenix's wings spread once more, its form beginning to dissolve into a myriad of shimmering green and gold particles that swirled around her.<br/><br/>Those particles—embers of jade-began to merge with Feng Mei's very being, sinking into her skin, her bones, and her heart.<br/><br/>She gazed for a long time in the direction where the phoenix was, before sensing a change within herself.<br/><br/>Feng Mei, though still weak, felt something stir deep within her.<br/><br/>She could feel power, ancient and vast, coursing through her veins, as if the very essence of the phoenix was being shared with her.<br/><br/>Feng Mei gasped, her body still trembling, but the pain that had once threatened to overwhelm her was now a distant memory.<br/><br/>In its place was something new-strength.<br/><br/>Her eyes snapped open, and she found herself once again on the 16th step, her body still pressed against the stone.<br/><br/>The pressure was still there, crushing and immense, but it no longer felt insurmountable.<br/><br/>\"Mei'er!\"<br/><br/>It felt as though hours had passed, but when she opened her eyes, it seemed like only seconds —or perhaps an instant—had gone by, as Feng Yun was still in the exact position he had been in before she fainted.<br/><br/>With a slow, deliberate motion, Feng Mei pushed herself up and she no longer felt those<br/><br/>pressures.<br/><br/>Moreover, it seems like all the injuries that she suffered have also disappeared and have been replaced with power.<br/><br/>Feng Yun was stunned when Feng Mei, whom he believed had fallen unconscious, suddenly woke up and stood.<br/><br/>Now, she was casually dusting off her clothes, as though she had merely stumbled on the way.<br/><br/>\"Mei'er, Are you okay?\"<br/><br/>Feng Yun asked, his voice filled with concern. He was baffled by her current state, but his worry far outweighed his confusion.<br/><br/>He could find answers to his questions later; for now, his priority was making sure Feng Mei<br/><br/>was okay.<br/><br/>Feng Mei turned to see Feng Yun watching her with a worried expression.<br/><br/>At that moment, she felt confused, uncertain whether what she had witnessed was a dream or<br/><br/>reality.

Although she also didn't know the whole reason, she thought that it might be<br/><br/>because of the phoenix that she saw.<br/><br/>While not definitive, it was the most plausible explanation she could come up with.<br/><br/>Regardless, she felt those questions could wait for now; she still had something to do.<br/><br/>\"Brother Yun, I want to go to the 17th step!\"<br/><br/>With her injuries recovered and the pressure she felt decreased, she was filled with<br/><br/>confidence.<br/><br/>Feng Yun was at a loss for words; he had wanted to stop Feng Mei, but given her current condition, he felt that she might actually be able to do it this time.<br/><br/>He nodded in response.<br/><br/>\"But if you get injured or if even a single drop of blood falls, you have to stop. Promise me!\"<br/><br/>Even though she appeared fine, he couldn't shake the uncertainty-was it just adrenaline or<br/><br/>something else?<br/><br/>If this effect was temporary, she would still be in danger if it wore off. That's why he wanted<br/><br/>Feng Mei to promise that she would stop if she got hurt again.<br/><br/>Feng Mei nodded. She felt confident that this time, she could successfully climb to the 17th step.<br/><br/>If, despite this newfound strength, she still couldn't make it, she would accept it as her limit<br/><br/>and give up.<br/><br/>She looked up at it, her gaze steady, her resolve unshaken.<br/><br/>\"I can do this!\"<br/><br/>She whispered, her voice soft but sure.<br/><br/>And with that, she took a step forward.<br/><br/>Unlike before, even with the tremendous pressure, she didn't feel like it could hold her back.<br/><br/>There was no resistance, and before she knew it, she had stepped onto the 17th step.<br/><br/>She had made it!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
