Not bad! To be able to stand despite having lower cultivation, no wonder these trash struggled against you.\"<br/><br/>Elder Zhou Tianhua said calmly.<br/><br/>\"I'll give you a chance. Surrender and serve me, and I promise you will all be spared as long as you obey my commands!\"<br/><br/>Feng Zhenshan stood tall, his eyes unwavering as he stared at Elder Zhou Tianhua.<br/><br/>The air around them crackled with tension, the pressure from Zhou Tianhua's aura bearing down heavily on the members of the Feng Clan.<br/><br/>Most of the people thought that Feng Clan would accept Elder Zhou Tianhua's demand, after all there was no way that anyone from Misty Vale City had the power to go against the Three Element Divine Realm Cultivator.<br/><br/>\"Haha! Do you think you are someone special just because you have Three Elements Divine Realm cultivation?\"<br/><br/>Feng Zhenshan's voice rang out loud and clear, mocking the overconfidence of Elder Zhou Tianhua.<br/><br/>\"Even with such cultivation, it's a shame that you're just a coward who hides behind others, too afraid to show yourself until now. There is no way that we will submit to such a coward!\"<br/><br/>Feng Zhenshan said.<br/><br/>\"Y-YOU!\" Searᴄh the Novelƒire(.)ne*t website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>Elder Zhou Tianhua's eyes narrowed, his expression darkening at Feng Zhenshan's words. \"How dare you mock me, insect? I chose to show you mercy, but you don't seem to value it. Very well, I'll show you what true power is!\"<br/><br/>His voice boomed across the marketplace, causing those nearby to tremble with fear.<br/><br/>He raised his hand, and a violent surge of energy began to gather around him, creating a vortex of Qi.<br/><br/>The air grew heavy with elemental power as Elder Zhou Tianhua prepared to unleash his might.<br/><br/>\"Watch closely, you miserable worms! This is the power of the Three Elements Divine Realm!\"<br/><br/>Elder Zhou Tianhua shouted, his face twisted in a sneer as he channeled his energy into a massive attack.<br/><br/>Seeing this, Feng Zhenshan's expression turned serious. He knew that Elder Zhou Tianhua's attack would be devastating.<br/><br/>\"Everyone, protect Feng Mei and Feng Yun with all your might! If possible, take them away while I try to buy some time.\"<br/><br/>He commanded, his voice filled with urgency. The other Feng Clan Grand Elders quickly moved to form a very strong protective barrier around the younger generation.<br/><br/>But before Elder Zhou Tianhua's attack could reach them, a voice cut through the tension like a blade.<br/><br/>\"Don't worry,\" Feng Chen said calmly as he appeared in front of Feng Zhenshan, his presence instantly alleviating the pressure.<br/><br/>\"I've got this!\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen's arrival was like a beacon of hope for the Feng Clan's Grand Elders, instantly lifting the oppressive atmosphere<br/><br/>He stood there, radiating an aura of confidence and power that seemed to dwarf even the mighty Elder Zhou Tianhua.<br/><br/>-BANG!<br/><br/>Feng Chen extended his hand and effortlessly deflected the attack, shattering it with a casual gesture<br/><br/>The overwhelming energy of Elder Zhou Tianhua's attack was instantly shattered, dispersing into harmless wisps of Qi.<br/><br/>Elder Zhou Tianhua's eyes widened in disbelief as his powerful attack was effortlessly destroyed.<br/><br/>\"What... how is this possible?\"<br/><br/>He stammered, his voice filled with shock and anger. Then he noticed that somebody had interfered.<br/><br/>\"Who are you?\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen stood there not answering Edler Zhou Tianhua but was staring at the people behind Elder Zhou Tianhua.<br/><br/>\"F-Feng C-Chen, you broke through?\"<br/><br/>Yan Zhan shuttered and was extremely surprised to see that Feng Chen was emitting the aura of Three Elements Divine Realm.<br/><br/>Upon hearing Yan Zhan's words, Yan, Zhao and the Lui Family began to panic. Their faces paled as they realized the gravity of the situation.<br/><br/>Some of them began to back away slowly, regret clearly etched on their faces.<br/><br/>They had severely underestimated the strength of the Feng Clan, and now they had made an enemy out of him.<br/><br/>\"Damn it, how did we miss this?!\"<br/><br/>Muttered Zhao Chenxi under his breath, his voice filled with fear.<br/><br/>\"If I had known Feng Chen had broken through, I would have never dared to provoke the Feng<br/><br/>Clan like this!\"<br/><br/>He was regretting his decision to team up with Yan Clan.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the onlookers, who had been watching the confrontation unfold, were utterly stunned.<br/><br/>A wave of astonished gasps and whispers spread through the crowd.<br/><br/>\"Did I hear that right? Feng Head has broken through to the Three Elements Divine Realm?\"<br/><br/>\"I can't believe it! The Feng Clan has a Three Elements Divine Realm expert now? This changes everything!\"<br/><br/>\"It's no wonder he could easily deflect Elder Zhou Tianhua's attack. With Feng Chen at this level, the Feng Clan's position in Misty Vale City just became unshakeable!\"<br/><br/>\"If they survive this, then they will become the overlord of Misty Vale City!\"<br/><br/>The crowd's murmurs grew louder, a mix of awe and disbelief.<br/><br/>They had all witnessed Feng Chen's incredible display of power and realized that the Feng<br/><br/>Clan was no longer what it used to be.<br/><br/>The Feng Clan had just gone from being one of the major families to potentially being the<br/><br/>most dominant force in the city.<br/><br/>\"Hmph! So you have broken through, Feng Chen!\"<br/><br/>Elder Zhou Lei said angrily. He didn't anticipate that Feng Chen, who was humiliated, would<br/><br/>be able to advance to the Three Elements Divine Realm.<br/><br/>However, he knew his brother's power well and thought that a newly ascended Three<br/><br/>Elements Divine Realm would be no match for his brother.<br/><br/>\"So what? Do you think that you can survive after having offended me? Today, you and your<br/><br/>Feng Clan will die!\"<br/><br/>Elder Zhou Lei said arrogantly.<br/><br/>\"Last time, I spared you to give face to Mystic Flame Sect. But today, don't think any of you<br/><br/>will after trying to kill my family!\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen said releasing all his killing intent.<br/><br/>The air grew cold and heavy with Feng Chen's killing intent, sending a chill down the spines of<br/><br/>everyone present.<br/><br/>The sheer force of his aura made the weaker cultivators in the crowd take several steps back, unable to withstand the pressure.<br/><br/>\"You think you can intimidate me, boy? You're nothing but a fledgling compared to my<br/><br/>power!\"<br/><br/>Elder Zhou Tianhua stepped forward, his aura radiating a crushing pressure. He was angry that Feng Chen was not taking him seriously, even ignoring his presence.<br/><br/>\"My patience is thin, and I will not hold back.\"<br/><br/>With that, he unleashed a surge of energy, creating a violent storm of elemental force that<br/><br/>roared toward Feng Chen and the Feng Clan.<br/><br/>The marketplace erupted in chaos as people scrambled to avoid the clash.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there was no reaction from Feng Chen.<br/><br/>(Shall I try how much stronger Basic Sword Intent is?)<br/><br/>Feng Chen thought. Since a rare Three Element Divine Realm opponent has presented himself<br/><br/>to him, he wanted to see how he fare against such Three Element Divine Realm.<br/><br/>(He seemed to be in the Mid-Level Three Elements Divine Realm. If so, I will just use my initial-Level Three Elements Divine Realm cultivation.)<br/><br/>Feng Chen could use some more strength but decided against it as he wanted to check the<br/><br/>power of Sword Intent rather than his cultivation.<br/><br/>\"Heavenly Emperor's Sword!\"<br/><br/>With a decisive command, Feng Chen unleashed the attack.<br/><br/>A blinding beam of sword energy surged forth, cutting through the chaotic storm of<br/><br/>elemental force like a hot knife through butter.<br/><br/>SLASH!<br/><br/>The power of the Heavenly Emperor's Sword was overwhelming. The attack converged on<br/><br/>Elder Zhou Tianhua with the speed of a meteor.<br/><br/>Elder Zhou Tianhua's eyes widened in shock and fear as he sensed the immense power of the<br/><br/>attack and felt the power of sword intent in it.<br/><br/>\"Th-This is Sword Int...\"<br/><br/>Before he could finish his thought or react, the sword energy pierced through his defenses with lethal precision, engulfing him in a searing blaze of light.<br/><br/>In an instant, Elder Zhou Tianhua was obliterated, his body disintegrating into nothingness.<br/><br/>The force of the attack left the surrounding area eerily silent, the violent storm of elemental energy dissipating into nothingness.<br/><br/>The marketplace fell into a stunned silence. The crowd watched in shock and disbelief as Elder<br/><br/>Zhou Tianhua was vanquished in a single strike.<br/><br/>The once imposing aura of the Three Elements Divine Realm had vanished, leaving only a<br/><br/>lingering power of Heavenly Emperor's Sword.<br/><br/>Feng Chen looked around, his expression one of calm surprise.<br/><br/>\"Is that all?\"\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
