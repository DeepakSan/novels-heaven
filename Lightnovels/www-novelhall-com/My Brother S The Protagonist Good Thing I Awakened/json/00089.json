With a dramatic flourish, an attendant brought out a small, carefully sealed box. When it opened, the crowd gasped. Inside, resting upon a bed of black silk, was a radiant feather. Its fiery red and gold hues shimmered under the light, giving off a faint but palpable warmth that seemed to pulse with a life of its own. <br/><br/>\"A Skyfire Feather!\" <br/><br/>The crowd erupted into murmurs and gasps of astonishment. \"Skyfire Feather is said to contain a fragment of the ancient phoenix's life force,\" The auctioneer continued, \"and can be used in high-level alchemy or to heal injuries. For some, it may even hold the key to awakening a hidden bloodline.\" <br/><br/>The hall fell into a stunned silence. Even the most powerful figures in the room sat up straighter, their interest piqued. <br/><br/>Indeed, after all that boring stuff, Azure Sky Chamber Of Commerce was finally bringing out the big gun. <br/><br/>\"This… \" <br/><br/>Feng Mei's heart skipped a beat the moment the feather was revealed. Without knowing why, she felt a deep connection to it, as if the relic was calling out to her, resonating with something deep within. Her hands clenched slightly on the armrest of her seat, her eyes fixed on the Phoenix Feather. <br/><br/>Feng Yun, sitting beside her, noticed her sudden change in demeanor. \"Mei'er, what's wrong?\" <br/><br/>\"I… I don't know!\" Feng Mei whispered, her voice unsteady. \"That feather… it feels like… it has some connection with me.\" <br/><br/>Feng Yun's eyes narrowed. \"You feel drawn to it?\" <br/><br/>Feng Mei nodded, her gaze never leaving the feather. \"I can't explain it, but it feels like it belongs to me.\" <br/><br/>Feng Yun glanced at his brother Feng Chen, who had also noticed Feng Mei's reaction. Although his brother has said that he would buy each of them something that they want, Skyfire Feather was highly sought after and it would cost a fortune to obtain one. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Feng Chen wasn't particularly concerned about losing the bid. He understood why Feng Mei felt such a strong connection to the Skyfire Feather; it was often said to be a feather from a phoenix. <br/><br/>This might be the reason why Feng Mei feels some kind of connection as she has a phoenix physique. <br/><br/>Although some Skyfire Feathers were believed to be true phoenix feathers, others came from creatures with a mixed phoenix bloodline, which is of inferior quality. <br/><br/>Although of inferior quality, the effects of those Skyfire Feather were similar. They could heal injuries and could even awaken the physique of some people. <br/><br/>If Feng Mei had a reaction to it, then Feng Chen thought that this Skyfire Feather must be of high quality and must be connected to the real phoenix. <br/><br/>( I must get this! ) <br/><br/>Feng Chen thought. Even if Feng Mei didn't want it, he had made up his mind to get it. A Real Phoenix Feather! <br/><br/>Its value couldn't be measured in mere Gold Coins and even in the System Store, it cost more than a hundred thousand System Points. <br/><br/>Furthermore, Feng Chen believed that if the feather were given to Feng Mei, it might even fully awaken her physique. However, he knew the chances were slim, as her Jade Phoenix physique was a top-tier bloodline, even among phoenixes. Awakening such a powerful lineage with just the feather would require an extraordinary stroke of luck. <br/><br/>\"If Feng Mei wants it, then we'll get it!\" Feng Chen said firmly, his eyes sharp as he turned back toward the auction stage. <br/><br/>\"But… it might be expensive!\" <br/><br/>Though Feng Mei was excited and truly desired the Skyfire Feather, she recognized from everyone's reactions that the competition would be fierce and acquiring it would come at a steep price. <br/><br/>\"Hehe… There is no need to worry about it. Just tell me whether you want this or not!\" <br/><br/>Feng Chen asked. <br/><br/>\"... I-I want it!\" <br/><br/>Feng Mei answered. Although she wasn't sure what it was, she had a feeling that getting that item would significantly boost her power. S~eaʀᴄh the nôᴠel Fire.nёt website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>Feng Chen nodded. <br/><br/>\"The starting bid for the Skyfire Feather is 50,000 gold coins. Bids must increase by no less than 1,000 gold coins.\" <br/><br/>Almost immediately, several hands shot up, and the price climbed at a staggering pace. The Tianlong Clan, the Cloudbreaker Sect, and even the Icy Veil Sect were all bidding, clearly recognizing the treasure's value. <br/><br/>\"60,000 gold coins!\" A voice from the Tianlong Clan declared. <br/><br/>\"70,000!\" Another from the Yuan Clan followed. <br/><br/>\"80,000!\" \"90,000!\" <br/><br/>\"100,000!\" <br/><br/>… <br/><br/>Soon the bid turned into 150,000 gold coins. The crowd below watched with shock on their faces. This amount of money was enough for generations to live in luxury but now it is used to obtain a single item. <br/><br/>Just as the Cloudbreaker Sect's representative leaned back, satisfied with their 150,000 gold coin bid, Feng Yun raised his hand. <br/><br/>\"160,000!\" <br/><br/>The room turned toward the Feng Clan's private booth. Several people murmured. Many didn't recognize the Feng Clan while those who did were surprised by their boldness. <br/><br/>Not only did they have the financial means to compete with the Cloudbreaker Sect, but typically, clans without a strong background would refrain from bidding against such powerful sects, especially at this stage of the auction. <br/><br/>The Cloudbreaker Sect elder chuckled lightly. \"Bold for such a small clan. 170,000 gold coins!\" <br/><br/>It seems like the Cloudbreaker Sect also didn't recognize the Feng Clan and only thought of them as some small clan who is ignorant of their standing. <br/><br/>Feng Chen raised his hand again without hesitation. \"200,000 gold coins!\" <br/><br/>The entire auction hall fell silent. Even the Cloudbreak Sect's elders raised an eyebrow, surprised by the sudden leap. <br/><br/>The Cloudbreaker Sect's representative hesitated, glancing nervously at his sect members. Even for them, this was an astronomical amount of money to spend on a single item. For the Feng Clan to be bidding so aggressively had caught everyone's attention. All eyes were now on them. <br/><br/>\"I didn't expect the Feng Clan to be so rich!\" <br/><br/>\"Not only are there peerless geniuses in their clan but they are even so rich.\" <br/><br/>\"I had underestimated the Feng Clan. Never did I think that they were so wealthy!\" <br/><br/>\"Hmph! Show off. They won't be able to buy any other items. It is a waste to spend so much on a Skyfire Feather!\" <br/><br/>… <br/><br/>Many were astonished by the Feng Clan's display of wealth, while others viewed it as a reckless and stupid decision. The Skyfire Feather was expected to fetch no more than 150,000 gold coins, yet Feng Chen had boldly bid 200,000. To many onlookers, this seemed like an unnecessary loss, with murmurs of the Feng Clan overpaying echoing through the hall. <br/><br/>And there were also those who wanted to know just who the clan was that dared to bid so high against the Cloudbreaker Sect. <br/><br/>This also included the Cloudbreaker Sect who felt humiliated that they couldn't compete with some unknown clan. <br/><br/>\"Find out who that was!\" <br/><br/>The elder from the Cloudbreaker Sect who bid against Feng Chen asked one of their servants. <br/><br/>\"Right away!\" <br/><br/>The Cloudbreaker Sect elder, though outwardly calm, was seething inside. Losing to what he considered a lesser clan was a public humiliation, and his pride wouldn't allow it to go unanswered. His eyes flickered with barely concealed rage as his servant hurried off to investigate the Feng Clan. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the auctioneer cleared his throat, eager to proceed now that no further bids were being made. <br/><br/>\"200,000 gold coins going once… going twice…\" <br/><br/>BANG! The auctioneer's gavel came down with a solid thud. <br/><br/>\"Sold! To the Feng Clan!\" <br/><br/>The auctioneer finally declared, his voice shaking slightly. Although rare and precious, getting 200,000 gold coins for Skyfire Feather was difficult even when auctioned in the capital. He knew that he had made a great profit by deciding to auction off this item here rather than send it off to the capital. <br/><br/>Feng Mei's eyes widened in astonishment. She hadn't expected Feng Chen to bid so high for Skyfire Feather. This also surprised other Feng members who didn't know just where the family head had got the money. <br/><br/>Their previous annual Clan income was only in the tens of thousands and now Feng Chen directly bid 200,000 gold coins for a single item. <br/><br/>It was like throwing away decades worth of income! <br/><br/>Feng Yun turned to Feng Mei with a smile. \"It's yours now.\" <br/><br/>Feng Mei nodded slowly, her heart racing with a mixture of excitement and relief. She didn't know why, but having that Skyfire Feather felt… right, like a missing piece of herself had just been found. <br/><br/>However, she was also scared of what might happen if nothing happened. Then she would have made Feng Chen waste 200,000 gold coins. <br/><br/>Such a huge amount was something that she couldn't even begin to imagine.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
