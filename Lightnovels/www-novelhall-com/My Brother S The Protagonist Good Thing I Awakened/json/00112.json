The crowd was still buzzing with the aftermath of the point revelation. Many of them already felt like the Feng Clan would win after all there was a big points difference between them and the Feng Clan. <br/><br/>But rather than feeling angry or sad about it, they took it as an opportunity to flatter the Feng Clan. <br/><br/>\"As expected of the Feng Clan! With talent like that, victory is surely yours!\" <br/><br/>\"Feng Yun's performance was nothing short of spectacular. Who could possibly challenge that?\" <br/><br/>\"I can't believe the point difference! Your Feng Clan is clearly in a league of their own!\" <br/><br/>…. <br/><br/>Many of them gathered around Feng Chen, showering him with praise. For most, whether they placed one position higher or lower was inconsequential; what truly mattered was forging a connection with the Feng Clan, who had the backing of the formidable Icy Veil Sect. <br/><br/>Feng Chen just nodded to them but didn't take their compliment to his heart. On the other hand, seeing those clans who used to kiss his a**, do the same to Feng Chen, Tianlong Qi couldn't help but curse them in his heart. <br/><br/>( Wasn't it simply that Feng Chen had good fortune and was surrounded by talented individuals? ) <br/><br/>Tianlong Qi mused. He couldn't help but think that if he were equally fortunate and had descendants as gifted as the geniuses of the Feng Clan, he wouldn't have to endure such humiliation. <br/><br/>Without much delay, Tianlong Zhen stepped forward again. \"Now,\" he began, \"we move immediately into the third round: The Monster Subjugation!\" <br/><br/>Excitement rippled through the crowd, while the participants steeled themselves for the next challenge. Tianlong Zhen continued, \"For this trial, each clan must send forth three participants. The challenge will be to subdue beasts of various ranks captured by our Tianlong Clan.\" \"Rank-1 monsters will grant 10 points, Rank-2 monsters will grant 50 points, Rank-3 monsters will earn you 100 points, and Rank-4 monsters, the most formidable of them all, will award 200 points. However, be warned: only those who successfully subdue their chosen beast will earn points. Failure to subdue will yield zero.\" <br/><br/>Many listened with a mix of excitement and trepidation. Still young and inexperienced, most of them had never faced a monster before and were uncertain about their capabilities. <br/><br/>They were also preoccupied with a crucial decision: which rank of monster to choose. Opting for a lower-ranked monster might ensure a win, but it would yield only a small number of points. <br/><br/>Conversely, selecting a more powerful monster could lead to greater rewards—but failure would result in a total loss. <br/><br/>This round was not just a test of strength; it required a keen understanding of one's own abilities.

With their training at Astral Training Pavilion, they already fought hundreds if not thousands of battles with various monsters and knew how to handle them as well as how strong of a monster they could handle. <br/><br/>Their only worry was whether they would be selected. <br/><br/>\"Please follow me to the Colosseum!\" Tianlong Zhen instructed, gesturing for everyone to move. The Colosseum, a magnificent arena, towered over the surrounding landscape, its imposing stone walls etched with ancient symbols of valor and triumph. Sunlight streamed through the arched openings, casting an ethereal glow on the sandy floor within. The air was thick with anticipation, the faint scent of earth mingling with the lingering aura of past battles. As the clan settled, the atmosphere shifted, an electric charge of energy surging through the air. <br/><br/>Tianlong Zhen stood at the center of the arena, now acting as referee and also to save the participant in case of mishap. After all, the monsters were ferocious, and it would be on the Tianlong Clan's shoulders if any of their geniuses were to perish. <br/><br/>\"Now, let us begin the third round,\" he announced, his voice echoing across the arena. \"I will call forth each clan. When your name is announced, please send forth your chosen participants.\" <br/><br/>A hush fell over the crowd as the tension grew palpable. \"First up, the Bai Clan! Please send forth your three participants!\" <br/><br/>A ripple of movement stirred among the Bai Clan members, and three figures stepped forward, their expressions filled with confidence and excitement. Bai Xun, the strongest of the trio, led the way, his eyes scanning the arena with confidence. Behind him were Bai Lin and Bai Fan, both equally eager to show their power. <br/><br/>The participants from the Bai Clan stood tall, aware that the eyes of the audience were upon them. <br/><br/>At the moment, they felt like protagonists with everyone's attention on them. \"Choose your monsters wisely!\" Tianlong Zhen advised them, his tone serious. \"Remember, only those who successfully subdue their beasts will earn points for your clan. Now, who will be the first one to challenge the monster?\" <br/><br/>\"Me!\" <br/><br/>Bai Xun confidently went first. He was in the Early Core Formation Stage which is much better than the other two who are just in the Foundation Establishment Stage. <br/><br/>With him being here, how could he give the opportunity to show off to others? <br/><br/>\"What Rank of monster would you like to fight?\" <br/><br/>Tianlong Zhen asked. <br/><br/>\"Hmph! Rank 3 monster!\" <br/><br/>Bai Xun answered arrogantly. He didn't think that against his power, a mindless monster would stand a chance. <br/><br/>Tianlong Zhen looked at him for a moment but didn't say anything and just informed someone to bring over a Rank-3 Monster. <br/><br/>With a nod from Tianlong Zhen, the gates of the beast enclosure creaked open, revealing the Rank-3 monster. A low growl reverberated through the arena as the creature stepped into the light, and an uneasy hush fell over the crowd. <br/><br/>The monster that emerged was a Nightshade Basilisk, a fearsome beast known for its lethal gaze and venomous fangs. Its scales shimmered with an unsettling blend of dark green and black, providing a perfect camouflage against the shadows. Its eyes, a brilliant shade of crimson, glinted with a predatory intelligence that sent a ripple of fear through the spectators, particularly those at the Foundation Establishment stage. <br/><br/>Bai Xun stood tall, but as the basilisk turned its piercing gaze toward him, a flicker of unease twisted in his stomach. For a brief moment, doubt crept in, and he hesitated. <br/><br/>But Bai Xun quickly shook off the feeling, forcing himself to meet the basilisk's stare. \"I am the greatest genius of the Bai Clan, \" he reminded himself. \"This beast is nothing compared to my strength!\"\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
