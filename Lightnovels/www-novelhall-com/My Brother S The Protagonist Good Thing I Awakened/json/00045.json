She was nearing a breakthrough, feeling the barrier to the next stage of her cultivation trembling before her.<br/><br/>CREAK!<br/><br/>Suddenly, the door to her chamber slid open with a soft creak. The delicate balance she had been maintaining was broken, and the flow of Qi around her was disrupted.<br/><br/>Ling Meiyu's eyes snapped open, and her focus shattered. She exhaled sharply, irritation flashing across her face.<br/><br/>(Who is disturbing my cultivation?)<br/><br/>She thought. She had specifically mentioned to everyone to not disturb her these days as she was preparing to advance to the next stage.<br/><br/>However, seeing that someone did disturb her, she also thought that perhaps there was an emergency, though she still felt a bit irritated.<br/><br/>\"Senior Sister!\"<br/><br/>A young female disciple came inside, her face pale and her eyes wide with anxiety. She bowed deeply, clearly aware of the gravity of her interruption.<br/><br/>\"Forgive me for disturbing your cultivation, but I have urgent news.\"<br/><br/>Ling Meiyu's irritation faded as she saw the expression on the disciple's face. She thought it mustn't be a simple matter as her junior sister dared to disturb her.<br/><br/>\"What is it?\"<br/><br/>She asked, her voice calm but tinged with an underlying note of concern.<br/><br/>The disciple hesitated for a moment, clearly struggling to find the right words.<br/><br/>\"It... it's about the Feng Clan, Senior Sister.\"<br/><br/>She finally managed to say.<br/><br/>At the mention of the Feng Clan, Ling Meiyu's heart skipped a beat.<br/><br/>The guilt she had buried deep within her surfaced momentarily, making her chest tighten with regret and unease.<br/><br/>She had broken off the engagement not out of malice but for reasons she believed were in her best interest.<br/><br/>But she quickly pushed these emotions away, recomposing herself.<br/><br/>)<br/><br/>(I have every right to decide my own future. I will only marry only the one who I find worthy!<br/><br/>She reminded herself firmly.<br/><br/>She believed that she had done nothing wrong and that whatever she did was best for her.<br/><br/>Ling Meiyu straightened her back, her expression hardening with resolve.<br/><br/>\"What about them?\"<br/><br/>Ling Meiyu asked.<br/><br/>\"Feng Clan Leader... he has killed Elder Zhou Lei.\"<br/><br/>Ling Meiyu's eyes widened in shock, her composure slipping for a moment.<br/><br/>\"What did you say?\"<br/><br/>She asked, her voice sharper than intended.<br/><br/>The disciple flinched at the intensity in Ling Meiyu's voice but repeated her words.<br/><br/>\"Elder Zhou Lei and Elder Zhou Tianhua of Spirit Wind Palace were killed by Feng Chen. The<br/><br/>news has been spread and everyone knows about it.\"<br/><br/>Ling Meiyu felt a wave of disbelief wash over her.<br/><br/>\"Elder Zhou Lei is killed? By Feng Chen? How?\"<br/><br/>She still couldn't believe it.<br/><br/>Elder Zhou Lei and Elder Zhou Tianhua were both formidable cultivators, especially Elder Zhou Tianhua, who was at the Mid-Level Three Elements Divine Realm.<br/><br/>(Did Uncl- I mean Feng Clan leader broke through?)<br/><br/>Ling Meiyu thought. The last time they met, Feng Chen had only shown his Peak Gran Qi Condensation Realm Cultivation.<br/><br/>However, since he killed Elder Zhou Tianhua, she concluded that he must have advanced after the annulment of the engagement.<br/><br/>\"How did the Feng Clan Leader even meet with Elder Zhou Lei? Did the Feng Clan Leader come to the capital or something?\"<br/><br/>Ling Meiyu asked. She has been in close-door cultivation ever since she came back to the sect from the Feng Clan Estate.<br/><br/>\"It seems like he wanted to get his revenge for his previous humiliation and went to Misty<br/><br/>Vale City.\"<br/><br/>Her junior sister answered.<br/><br/>Ling Meiyu then understood the reason why he was killed by Feng Chen.<br/><br/>Knowing the reason, she didn't feel any resentment towards Feng Chen.<br/><br/>After all, even though Zhou Lei was their sect's elder, if he had gone to find death then no one can be blamed for his bad decision.<br/><br/>\"However, that is not all.\"<br/><br/>Her junior sister continued.<br/><br/>\"Feng Yun, your ex-fiancee is rumored to have reached the Peak Foundation Establishment<br/><br/>Stage!\"<br/><br/>\"Feng Yun... Peak Foundation Establishment Stage?\"<br/><br/>Ling Meiyu repeated, her voice laced with surprise.<br/><br/>\"Are you certain about this?\"<br/><br/>The young disciple nodded earnestly.<br/><br/>\"Yes, Senior Sister. Rumors have already spread that Feng Yun has reached the Peak Foundation Establishment Stage. Given the recent events, it seems likely that this is true.\"<br/><br/>Ling Meiyu's mind raced as she tried to reconcile this new information.<br/><br/>The Feng Clan's rise in power and the strength of Feng Chen were significant, but Feng Yun's rapid advancement was something else entirely.<br/><br/>After all, Feng Chen had already been recognized for his talent by reaching Grand Qi Condensation at the age of 20, though this was nothing compared to her own progress.<br/><br/>But the fact that Feng Yun, who had previously been at the Early Qi Gathering Stage, had managed to rise to the Peak Foundation Establishment Stage in just two months was extremely astonishing.<br/><br/>Even she took a year to go from the Early Qi Gathering Stage to the Peak Foundation Establishment Stage, although she was much younger than Feng Yun.<br/><br/>But that also was due to the fact that she has the help of the Ling Family which is the top family in Azure Sky Empire with much more resources than Feng Clan.<br/><br/>(Just how could he advance so quickly?)<br/><br/>Ling Meiyu thought.<br/><br/>(Was father right? Is Feng Yun really a late bloomer?)<br/><br/>Before her father went into a coma, despite Feng Yun's status as trash, her father wouldn't annul the engagement and would also say that Feng Yun was just a late bloomer or something<br/><br/>to her.<br/><br/>She always thought that her father was just saying this because of his relationship with the Feng Clan, but now that Feng Yun has rapidly grown stronger, her father's words seem to hold<br/><br/>true.<br/><br/>(Nonetheless, I refuse to marry someone against my will. Feng Yun, no matter how powerful seaʀᴄh thё Nôvel(F)ire.nёt website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>you become, I will defeat you!)<br/><br/>Ling Meiyu remained steadfast in her belief that breaking the engagement had been the right decision, regardless of Feng Yun's growing strength.<br/><br/>(Even if his talent is greater than mine, he could never catch up to my cultivation!)<br/><br/>Ling Meiyu was confident that, despite Feng Yun's rapid progress, the time he had lost would eventually hinder his advancement.<br/><br/>She was already in the Grand Qi Condensation Realm, and by the time the promised three-<br/><br/>year battle commenced, she was certain she would have advanced to the Three Elements<br/><br/>Divine Realm.<br/><br/>No matter how quickly Feng Yun grew, she believed it was impossible for him to catch up to<br/><br/>her and defeat her.<br/><br/>\"Thank you for letting me know, junior sister.\"<br/><br/>Ling Meiyu said with a smile.<br/><br/>\"If that's all, I would like to return to my cultivation now.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
