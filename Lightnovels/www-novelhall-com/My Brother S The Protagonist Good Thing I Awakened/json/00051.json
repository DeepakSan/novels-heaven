I can already feel my Techniques getting stronger.\"<br/><br/>\"The ability to practice combat scenarios and face simulated opponents without any real risk is incredible. It's like having endless opportunities to perfect our skills.\"<br/><br/>\"Exactly! The pavilion's environments are so varied—it's not just about fighting but also about adapting to different situations. This will definitely help us prepare for the diverse challenges we might face in the Eastern Gathering.\"<br/><br/>\"We can also fight with full power against others without worrying about death. I just fought with Feng Jianhog and learned quite a bit.\"<br/><br/>\"Yeah! Feng Mei's real power is also no joke. I always felt that I might be overestimating her power but damn! I realized that I was underestimating her and her full power can easily defeat someone like me in seconds.\"<br/><br/>The enthusiasm among the Feng Clan members for the Astral Training Pavilion was palpable.<br/><br/>They were eager to explore its full potential, and the discussions around the facility highlighted their excitement and dedication.<br/><br/>\"Good! Good!\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen remarked, noting the intense dedication with which the clan members were training.<br/><br/>\"Looks like I can leave without worrying!\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen planned to leave the clan for a moment to go and explore the Stormhowl Valley.<br/><br/>The Stormhowl Valley is a treacherous, storm-ravaged territory located several days' journey from Misty Vale City.<br/><br/>Known for its unpredictable weather and towering cliffs, the valley earned its name from the relentless gales that sweep through the region, howling like fierce beasts. seaʀᴄh thё Novёlƒire.n(e)t website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>Lightning often strikes the rugged landscape, and thunder echoes throughout the valley, creating an ominous atmosphere.<br/><br/>Moreover, the monsters present there are all powerful and it would be very dangerous for even the Grand Qi Condensation Realm cultivators to survive for a few days in the Stormhowl Valley.<br/><br/>If one were to go deeper into the Stormhowl Valley, then they would only meet stronger monsters, even those Rank-6 monsters who are as strong if not stronger than the Nascent Soul Realm cultivator.<br/><br/>Despite the dangers, Feng Chen was eager to visit Stormhowl Valley.<br/><br/>A few days earlier, after raiding the treasuries of the Yan, Liu, and Zhao families, he had acquired what appeared to be a treasure map from the Zhao Family.<br/><br/>The authenticity of the map and the existence of the treasures were uncertain because for one Zhao Family would have already taken the treasures if it was true or it could also be that it is extremely hard to get.<br/><br/>In any case, there was a possibility and if there were indeed real treasures, then it could help the clan immensely.<br/><br/>His second motivation was more personal. Since becoming the leader of the Feng Clan, Feng Chen has been unable to travel or explore due to the constant threat of invasion from the former major families.<br/><br/>With those enemies now eliminated and the Feng Clan significantly strengthened, he saw this as an opportunity to venture out and explore the valley.<br/><br/>\"Hehe... I'll leave things in Elder Wei's hands for a few days! I can't wait to see what kind of adventure awaits me in Stormhowl Valley!\"<br/><br/>Before departing, Feng Chen made meticulous preparations. He visited the clan's key elders and assigned tasks to ensure the clan's smooth operation in his absence.<br/><br/>Feng Chen summoned Elder Wei to the main hall, giving him the instructions.<br/><br/>\"Elder Wei, you'll be in charge while I'm gone. Make sure the clan members stay focused on their training.\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen continued.<br/><br/>\"And take this token with you. It contains a fragment of my soul. If anything important arises,<br/><br/>just crush it, and I'll know immediately.\"<br/><br/>Elder Wei nodded and bowed respectfully.<br/><br/>\"Understood, Nephew. You can count on me to maintain order while you are gone.\"<br/><br/>Elder Wei and the other elders didn't think much about Feng Chen leaving to explore the Stormhowl Valley.<br/><br/>They knew just how much he had sacrificed to keep Feng Clan safe.<br/><br/>Previously, he would travel around the Azure Sky Empire and would rarely stay at Misty Vale City.<br/><br/>However, when his parents disappeared, the Feng Clan was left vulnerable. Feng Chen had no choice but to set aside his personal desires and remain at the Feng Estate to protect his family<br/><br/>and clan.<br/><br/>Now that their enemies were gone and they were on the rise, the Elders felt that Feng Chen should do what he wanted.<br/><br/>They also strengthen their resolve to keep the Feng Clan safe.<br/><br/>Now that their strength has increased, they wanted to ease the burden on their Clan Leader who has taken all the burden until now.<br/><br/>With preparations in place, Feng Chen checked his Storage Ring, which included several high- grade medicinal pills and a few defensive treasures from the clan's vault.<br/><br/>He had no intention of underestimating the dangers of \"Stormhowl Valley\". Although he could also get those things from the System Store, he didn't want to waste his already diminished System Points on things that he could easily acquire.<br/><br/>He wanted to check on Feng Yun before departing but knew that he shouldn't disturb his brother who previously was on the verge of breaking through to the Core Formation Stage.<br/><br/>\"Okay then, I will be back in a few days!\"\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
