Elder Zhou Tianhua of Spirit Wind Palace is dead? Who killed him?\"<br/><br/>\"Looks like a head of a clan from a remote area did that. You know, the one who previously defeated Elder Zhou Lei. Moreover, he seemed to have also killed Elder Zhou Lei.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, Feng Chen! I remembered his name previously and thought that he might die because of Zhou Lei's retaliation. Didn't expect the result to be the opposite!\"<br/><br/>\"Tsk! Tsk! Looks like the Zhou Clan has suffered quite a bit. They should be preparing to take revenge against the Feng Clan.\"<br/><br/>\"Who knows? They have already made various enemies and might not have resources to avenge their death.\" S~eaʀᴄh the Novёlƒire.n(e)t website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>Misty Vale City wasn't the only place the news spread. Due to the death of Elder Zhou Lei and Elder Zhou Tianhua, both of whom belonged to the Top-3 Sect in Azure Sky Empire, the news spread far and wide.<br/><br/>\"Feng Chen is definitely talented enough to be able to kill Elder Zhou Tianhua who is in Mid- Level Three Elements Divine Realm.\"<br/><br/>\"Indeed! However, I am more interested in his younger brother.\"<br/><br/>\"Feng Yun, ex-fiancee of Ling Meiyu? What about him?\"<br/><br/>\"Rumor has it that he fought against 5 Core Formation Stage and survived.\"<br/><br/>\"What? Wasn't he a trash who couldn't cultivate?\"<br/><br/>\"That's just nonsense! Who dared call him trash after he won the Annual Genius Competition of Misty Vale City? He was able to reach the Mid-Level Foundation Establishment Stage at the age of 16.\"<br/><br/>\"WOW! I guess the news that Ling Meiyu divorced him because of his lack of talent seems to be false then.\"<br/><br/>\"Must be fabricated by the Mystic Flame Sect. Lately, they've been acting like they're untouchable. This should be a good Lesson for them.\"<br/><br/>The news of the recent battle in Misty Vale City had spread rapidly, and due to Feng Yun's connection with Ling Meiyu, it traveled even further.<br/><br/>After all, everyone in Azure Sky Empire would pay attention to the things that are connected to the Little Sect leader of the Number One sect.<br/><br/>And Of course, that includes the sect itself which is Mystic Flame Sect. They have also heard about the rumors and the news about the death of their elder, Zhou Lei.<br/><br/>Nestled high in the Cloudreach Mountains, the Mystic Flame Sect is renowned as the most prestigious and formidable sect in the Azure Sky Empire.<br/><br/>The sect's headquarters is located in a place where the mountains pierce the clouds, giving it an ethereal appearance.<br/><br/>Surrounded by vast stretches of ancient forests and powerful spiritual veins, the Mystic Flame Sect is not only a hub of cultivation but also a place of breathtaking beauty and awe-inspiring grandeur.<br/><br/>The sect's main complex is a masterpiece of architecture, built with gleaming white stone and adorned with intricate carvings of phoenixes and flames-symbolizing the sect's affinity with fire.<br/><br/>Red and gold banners flutter in the wind, reflecting the sect's colors and adding to the majestic atmosphere.<br/><br/>Deep within the sect's inner sanctum lies the Flame Hall, the most sacred place in Mystic Flame Sect.<br/><br/>It is here that the sect leader and elders gather to discuss and strategize.<br/><br/>The hall is said to be imbued with the ancient flames of the first sect leader, flames that have never been extinguished and are rumored to grant enlightenment and immense power to those deemed worthy.<br/><br/>As the news of Elder Zhou Lei's death reached the sect, the Mystic Flame Sect was in uproar and the elders called for a meeting.<br/><br/>During the meeting, the Sect Master of the Mystic Flame Sect was absent, and the Grand Elder Xuan Yan, second in command only to the Sect Leader, presided over the gathering.<br/><br/>BANG!<br/><br/>The Grand Elder Xuan Yan, slammed his fist on the armrest of his chair, his face flushed with anger.<br/><br/>\"This is outrageous!\"<br/><br/>He thundered, his voice echoing through the hall.<br/><br/>\"It was already a disgrace that Elder Zhou Lei lost to a mere clan leader from a backwater city like Misty Vale City. But to go back and meet his end there? This is an insult to our sect's honor!\"<br/><br/>The hall was filled with tense silence as Grand Elder Xuan Yan's words hung in the air.<br/><br/>Mystic Flame Sect had always been known for its overbearing nature, but this time, the line had been crossed.<br/><br/>The news of Elder Zhou Lei's actions had spread far and wide, leading to widespread criticism from both allies and rivals alike.<br/><br/>\"People are now openly questioning our conduct,\" Grand Elder Xuan Yan continued, his tone sharp with frustration.<br/><br/>\"They're saying that we've lost control of our own members and that our arrogance knows no bounds.\"<br/><br/>An elder seated nearby added, \"It's one thing for us to assert our dominance, but for Zhou Lei to go so far as to personally seek out and attempt to kill someone from a lesser-known clan has made us look reckless and unrestrained. Even the Royal Family sent a message warning us to restrain ourselves!\"<br/><br/>The Mystic Flame Sect had always thrived on its reputation for strength and ruthlessness, but this incident had painted them in a different light-one of uncontrolled aggression.<br/><br/>Even those who typically admired their strength were now calling for the sect to rein in its behavior.<br/><br/>Moreover, with Elder Zhou Lei being killed by Feng Chen, the Mystic Flame Sect's fearsome reputation has been diminished, leading others to openly criticize and question their actions. \"Zhou Lei, taking this matter into his own hands was one thing, but to fail so miserably? If only he could have wiped out the Feng Clan as he intended then we wouldn't be having such a<br/><br/>headache.\"<br/><br/>One of the elders said as he cursed the already dead Elder Zhou Lei.<br/><br/>The room was filled with murmurs of discontent. For a sect that prided itself on its power,<br/><br/>being criticized for lack of control was a bitter blow.<br/><br/>They were used to being feared, not mocked or questioned for their decisions.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
