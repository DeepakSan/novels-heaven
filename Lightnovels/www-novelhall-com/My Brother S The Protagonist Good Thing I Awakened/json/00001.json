Despite his outward cheer, a sense of hopelessness lurked beneath Feng Chen's smile<br/><br/>As the youngest head of one of the five major families in Misty Vale City, Feng Chen's achievements were the talk of the town.<br/><br/>Reaching the Grand Qi Condensation Realm at such a young age was no small feat, and it was the reason why Feng Clan was able to maintain its status as one of the Five Major Clan in Misty Vale City.<br/><br/>Feng Chen's rise had not been merely a stroke of luck or the result of mere talent. He had been a transmigrator- a secret known only to him.<br/><br/>Having a mature mind, Feng Chen was able to easily grasp the technique which his peers might have struggled with.<br/><br/>Despite being one of the strongest in the city, Feng Chen knew that he wasn't all that great.<br/><br/>The gap between true genius and ordinary talent was vast and unbridgeable. While some could achieve the Grand Qi Condensation Realm by eight, enter the Three Elements Divine Realm by ten, and master martial arts by eighteen.<br/><br/>Compared to these prodigies, Feng Chen knew his own achievements, though impressive, were pale.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, in this remote area, achieving the Grand Qi Condensation Realm was already considered to be the strongest.<br/><br/>In the Feng Clan, only he, Feng Chen was at the Grand Qi Condensation Realm and most elders were at just the Core Formation Stage.<br/><br/>It was only because of Feng Chen who not only broke through Grand Qi Condensation Realm but is also at the peak of Grand Qi Condensation Realm that Feng Clan was able to maintain its status as one of five major families in Misty Vale City.<br/><br/>Otherwise, to be one of the Major Clan in Misty Vale City, one had to have at least three people who are in Grand Qi Condensation Realm.<br/><br/>The weight of his family's future pressed heavily on his shoulders. Despite his own strength, the rest of the Feng family lacked the prowess and potential needed to uphold their current standing.<br/><br/>His family members were either weak or lacking in talent. The strongest among them were barely at the Core Formation Stage and they were his elders who had been cultivating for a hundred years.<br/><br/>Although Feng Chen-who reached the pinnacle of the Grand Qi Condensation Realm by his twentieth year-stood as a beacon of unparalleled genius, the rest of his generation seemed to falter in comparison.<br/><br/>While Feng Chen's achievements were nothing short of extraordinary, his contemporaries struggled, with none of his peers even attaining the Core Formation Stage yet.<br/><br/>The younger generation, too, appeared lackluster in their potential. Among those under twenty, the most promising cultivator had barely reached the Initial Foundation Establishment Stage, casting a shadow of doubt over the future of their lineage.<br/><br/>Feng Chen's heart ached with the knowledge that, should anything happen to him, the Feng Clan's status would be in jeopardy. The other great families in Misty Vale City were formidable and were eagerly eyeing his clan.<br/><br/>The Liu family, the Zhao family, and others had numerous talented individuals and resources that dwarfed his own. Without a capable successor, the Feng Clan might very well fall from grace.<br/><br/>His fears were not unfounded. The rise of the Feng Clan had been swift, but such rapid ascension made them a target.<br/><br/>If they lost their current prominence, they could quickly become just another second-rate family, relegated to the periphery of Misty Vale City's social and political circles.<br/><br/>\"Sigh!\"<br/><br/>As the celebration continued, a young girl approached and knelt before him.<br/><br/>\"Elder brother, Feng Mei greets you.\"<br/><br/>Feng Mei, a bright and beautiful girl with a lively spirit, had been adopted by Feng Chen's uncle, Feng Chun.<br/><br/>Her sweet demeanor and intelligence had endeared her to the entire family, especially Feng Chen.<br/><br/>In the entire Feng Clan, apart from his blood brother, only Feng Mei was allowed to address Feng Chen as her brother.<br/><br/>\"Hehe, get up quickly, Mei'er. Your presence brightens my day,\" Feng Chen said, helping her up with a warm smile.<br/><br/>This scene was seen by many younger generations of Feng Clan and they could only hide their<br/><br/>envy.<br/><br/>As she looked around, Mei's eyes sought out Feng Chen's younger brother, Feng Yun. \"Where is brother Feng Yun?\" she asked.<br/><br/>The crowd fell silent at the mention of Feng Yun: Feng Yun, the only blood brother of Feng Chen.<br/><br/>Yet, Feng Yun's root bone was very poor and he was barely able to reach the fifth level of Qi Gathering at the age of sixteen.<br/><br/>\"Eh, Clan leader, I think Brother Feng Yun went to prepare a special gift for you,\" a young boy answered.<br/><br/>Feng Chen nodded slightly. Unlike others, Feng Chen didn't feel disappointed by his younger brother's cultivation.<br/><br/>The other members of the family had high expectations for Feng Yun, given that he was Feng Chen's younger brother. They anticipated him to be a genius, following in his parents and brother's formidable footsteps. Sёarch* The NôᴠelFirё.net website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>However, they were quickly confronted with a sobering reality: not only did Feng Yun fail to exhibit any signs of genius, but he also struggled to measure up to the average member of the<br/><br/>Feng Clan.<br/><br/>Feng Chen didn't feel that his younger brother needed to be a genius as long as he was happy. As for the family problems, as long as he was around, he was prepared to handle them. Although it was his birthday celebration, Feng Chen wasn't in a particularly good mood. He knows that many of the guests weren't there because they wished him happiness<br/><br/>!!!<br/><br/>As Feng Chen brooded over the future of the Feng Clan, a sudden, strange sensation washed over him. His vision blurred, and a hum filled the air.<br/><br/>A faint, ethereal light seemed to emerge in his mind, and before Feng Chen could react, a<br/><br/>voice echoed in his mind.<br/><br/>[ System Initialization Complete!]<br/><br/>[Welcome to the Martial Arts System]<br/><br/>[Congratulations, Host, on binding with the system. This system is here to assist you in becoming a true unparalleled genius of the Heavenly Domain. ]<br/><br/>Feng Chen's eyes widened in shock and disbelief. The sensation was both foreign and<br/><br/>familiar, and the voice was clear and commanding.<br/><br/>\"What is this?\" he murmured. Although he said that, it was not out of not knowing what it was but because of the shock.<br/><br/>As an avid reader of webnovel in his past life, how could he be ignorant of what the system is?<br/><br/>However, it has been years since he was born and although he hoped for a Golden Finger to appear which would make him a protagonist, it never did and he had given up hope after so<br/><br/>many years.<br/><br/>Now that it appeared, he didn't know what to say. He had never heard about a system that was<br/><br/>so late.<br/><br/>Thirty Years!<br/><br/>It had been thirty years and the system was popping out like he was born just today. If he had a system from the moment he was born, Feng Chen thought that he and his clan would already be sitting at the top of this world.<br/><br/>However, even though the System had come late, at least it had finally arrived. Better late<br/><br/>than never!<br/><br/>\"Hahaha!\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen's initial shock quickly transformed into an almost uncontrollable laughter. The realization that a system had finally arrived, albeit three decades late, was both a source of relief and amusement.<br/><br/>Feng Chen's sudden outburst of laughter puzzled the guests in the room. Especially the Zhao, Liu, and Yan family who are against the Feng Clan.<br/><br/>\"Brother, are you alright?\" Feng Mei's voice broke through his reverie, her expression a mix<br/><br/>of concern and curiosity.<br/><br/>Feng Chen quickly composed himself, waving off her concern with a reassuring smile. \"I'm<br/><br/>fine, Mei'er. Just a bit of excitement.\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen took a deep breath and forced a calm, reassuring smile. He waved his hand dismissively as he turned his attention back to the guests.<br/><br/>\"Everyone, please, continue to enjoy the festivities. Eat to your heart's content, and forgive<br/><br/>me if there's anything lacking in the arrangements. Today is a day of celebration, and I want everyone to have a good time.\"<br/><br/>He gestured toward the grand tables laden with delicacies and sumptuous dishes, their aroma<br/><br/>wafting through the hall. \"Please, don't hold back. Let's make this a joyous occasion for all.\"<br/><br/>The guests, sensing that the head of the Feng family had regained his composure, resumed their cheerful conversations and laughter.<br/><br/>While those hostile to Feng Clan couldn't understand the sudden enthusiasm from Feng Chen.<br/><br/>However, they thought that Feng Chen was unnecessarily happy on his birthday and looked down on his behavior.<br/><br/>As a Clan leader of One of the Five Major Clan, how could one lose their composure easily?<br/><br/>\"Humph! Feng Chen is really too immature to be a clan leader,\" one of the Zhao family members muttered under their breath.<br/><br/>\"Indeed,\" another from the Liu family agreed, \"He laughs like a fool. No wonder the Feng<br/><br/>Clan is declining.\"<br/><br/>\"Let's see how long his happiness lasts,\" a Yan family elder sneered. \"Feng Clan better pray<br/><br/>that Feng Chen doesn't disappear like their previous Patriarch!<br/><br/>The three families continued to mock Feng Chen, although in a low voice to avoid being heard by Feng Chen. Although appearing arrogant, they didn't seem to want to mess with the Feng<br/><br/>Clan at the moment.<br/><br/>The festive atmosphere continued unabated, but Feng Chen's mind was occupied with the<br/><br/>sudden arrival of the Martial Arts System.<br/><br/>The system, while arriving late, could be the key to solving the very problems that had been<br/><br/>weighing heavily on his mind.<br/><br/>It was his chance to ensure that the Feng Clan not only survived but thrived.<br/><br/>\"Perhaps,\" he mused, \"This is a new beginning.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
