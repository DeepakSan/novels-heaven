I can't believe that you actually dared to refuse the offer from the Third Prince. You sure are brave!\"<br/><br/>Steward Li's smile faltered, barely masking the anger simmering beneath the surface.<br/><br/>As the steward of a prince, he was accustomed to maintaining his composure, but the idea of being slighted by a clan as insignificant as the Feng Clan made it difficult for him to hide his frustration.<br/><br/>Wang Yifan watched the scene unfold with a mix of surprise and disbelief. He never expected Feng Chen to have the audacity to reject Steward Li so openly.<br/><br/>In his mind, accepting the steward's offer was the obvious choice. Most people, in their ambition to expand their power, would overlook any potential disadvantages.<br/><br/>As long as they could gain the influence of a prince, they would eagerly seize the opportunity, especially smaller clans and families without a strong backing.<br/><br/>Steward Li's composure wavered as he struggled to hide his vexation. His eyes narrowed as he assessed Feng Chen, who remained unfazed by the steward's mounting frustration.<br/><br/>\"You are aware of what you're rejecting, aren't you? The Third Prince's offer could ensure your clan's security and future prosperity. Do you really believe you can stand against the Zhou Clan and others without such backing?\"<br/><br/>Steward Li's voice carried a hint of scorn.<br/><br/>Although he might have said that out of anger, it was indeed true.<br/><br/>If Feng Chen's strength was really at Three Elements Divine Realm then he would really have no choice but to accept Steward Li's offer.<br/><br/>The Zhou Clan may not have sent anyone immediately to avenge their elders, but that doesn't mean they've forgotten.<br/><br/>Once they complete their current tasks and have the opportunity, they will undoubtedly turn their attention and resources toward the Feng Clan, seeking retribution for the deaths of their two elders.<br/><br/>So, their only choice of survival was to accept the Third Prince's offer, at least that is what Steward Li believed.<br/><br/>\"I appreciate the offer, but our clan is simply not equipped with enough power to serve under the Third Prince. It's better for us to focus on our own growth within Misty Vale City.\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen said.<br/><br/>Steward Li's eyes widened in disbelief.<br/><br/>\"So, you truly believe that your clan, in its current state, can handle the dangers ahead without the Third Prince's support?\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen nodded firmly.<br/><br/>\"You're making a grave mistake, Feng Clan Leader. The Third Prince's protection would shield you from numerous threats. By refusing, you might very well be sealing your own fate.\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen's expression remained calm. It was preferable to have the Zhou Clan as an enemy rather than becoming entangled with factions connected to other members of the Royal Family.<br/><br/>He was confident in his ability to handle the Zhou Clan, but he wasn't as certain about confronting other clans that might be allied with the rival factions of the Imperial Family, who could potentially have Nascent Soul Realm cultivators.<br/><br/>Thus, it was wise for Feng Chen to avoid provoking these other factions by allying with the Third Prince, as they could pose a much greater threat.<br/><br/>\"I've made my decision based on what's best for the Feng Clan. We will face any threats on our own terms!\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen replied, showing no intention of accepting the Third Prince's proposal.<br/><br/>Steward Li's frustration was palpable, his voice rising slightly.<br/><br/>\"You're underestimating the gravity of this situation. The Third Prince's favor is not something to be taken lightly. Your refusal will not go unnoticed.\"<br/><br/>Wang Yifan, observing the tension, stepped in with a concerned tone.<br/><br/>\"Steward Li, perhaps it is best to allow the Feng Clan some space to consider their position. Perhaps they might change their mind soon!\"<br/><br/>Steward Li's eyes flashed with irritation, but he nodded curtly.<br/><br/>\"Very well. I will report this to the Third Prince. Be prepared for any consequences that may arise from your decision.\"<br/><br/>With that, Steward Li turned sharply and exited the manor, his frustration evident in his hurried stride.<br/><br/>The door slammed shut behind him, leaving a heavy silence in the room.<br/><br/>Wang Yifan looked at Feng Chen with a mixture of admiration and concern.<br/><br/>\"You've made a bold choice, but the ramifications could be significant. Are you certain you can handle the fallout from this decision?\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen nodded resolutely.<br/><br/>\"Yes. We will deal with whatever comes our way. It's better to face our challenges directly and maintain our independence than to be drawn into political entanglements.\"<br/><br/>Wang Yifan's expression softened with understanding.<br/><br/>\"I respect your decision, Young Master Feng Chen. However, the capital is indeed in a state of tension due to the Emperor's declining health. The political factions are maneuvering for advantage, and the Third Prince is no exception. He is seeking to consolidate support wherever he can.\"<br/><br/>Wang Yifan paused, his expression reflecting the gravity of the situation.<br/><br/>\"The capital's turmoil means that alliances are more valuable than ever, but it also means that the risks of entanglement are higher. The Third Prince's offer was meant to gain your loyalty and expand his influence to the eastern empire.\"<br/><br/>He continued, his tone sincere.<br/><br/>\"The balance of power is fragile, and those who are not aligned with a faction may find themselves caught in the crossfire.\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen nodded, acknowledging the wisdom in Wang Yifan's words. Just because he declined Third Prince's proposal doesn't mean that he would be free from the power struggle.<br/><br/>Other clans and factions would undoubtedly seek to expand their influence, and the Feng Clan would be a part of that dynamic.<br/><br/>Given their demonstrated strength, it was inevitable that they would attract attention from the various Imperial factions eager to extend their reach into the eastern regions of the<br/><br/>empire.<br/><br/>The Feng Clan's visibility and potential could not be easily overlooked.<br/><br/>\"I understand the gravity of the situation, and we will remain vigilant. Our priority is to protect the Feng Clan and ensure its stability amidst the chaos.\" Sёarch* The ηovelFire.ηet website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>Wang Yifan gave a respectful bow.<br/><br/>\"I appreciate your thinking. However, it doesn't seem that achieving that will be easy. I came here not only because of Steward Li but also to remind you of something important\"<br/><br/>Wang Yifan continued.<br/><br/>\"The eastern part of the empire gathers every three years for a major assembly, and this time, the Feng Clan will need to attend.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
