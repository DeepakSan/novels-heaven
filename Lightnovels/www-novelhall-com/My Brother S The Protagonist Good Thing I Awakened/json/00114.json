Tianlong Clan participants also achieved a good result though their last participant messed up and got Zero points. <br/><br/>In total, they earned 200 points. If the last participant had chosen a Rank 2 monster, they would have tied with the Yuan Clan in points for this round. However, in an attempt to surpass them, Tianlong Clan's last participant challenged a Rank 3 monster, which proved to be beyond his ability. This decision cost them the 50 points they could have secured. <br/><br/>However, the Rank 3 monster that they got was considerably weaker compared to the Yuan Clan and it was the same for the last participant. <br/><br/>But the last participant of the Tianlong Clan made a critical mistake and he was too slow to dodge the Rank 3 monster attack, and was seriously injured. <br/><br/>Even if the Rank 3 monster was the weakest of the weak, he was still a Rank 3 monster capable of killing any Core Formation Stage human. <br/><br/>The mistake cost them 100 points and instead, they got Zero points. <br/><br/>\"TRASH!\" <br/><br/>Tianlong Qi couldn't help but curse. He has helped them so much and even then they failed. <br/><br/>He couldn't help but think that each and every one of them was trash who couldn't even complete simple tasks despite receiving so much help. <br/><br/>If he could've taken down the weakened Rank 3 monster he had prepared, their clan would've snagged 100 more points and jumped ahead of the Yuan Clan to grab first place. Instead, they were still stuck in third. <br/><br/>In total, they had 800 points which was still less than the Feng Clan who didn't even participate yet. <br/><br/>\"Lastly, we have the Feng Clan. Please, send out your participants!\" <br/><br/>Tianlong Zhen said. <br/><br/>With that, everyone's focus was on the Feng Clan. <br/><br/>They wanted to see who Feng Chen would send out. They knew Feng Yun was 100 % guaranteed to appear but didn't know who the other two would be. <br/><br/>Would it be Feng Jianhong who showed surprising results in the first place, Feng Mei who has the same aptitude as Ling Meiyuu, or Feng Liang who broke Rank-2 Formation in under 30 minutes? It was the same for the Feng Clan members who wanted to know who Feng Chen would select. <br/><br/>\"Xiaoyu'er, Mei'er, and Jianhong'er will go!\" <br/><br/>Feng Chen was chosen based on the fact that in the last round, Feng Yun and Feng Liang participated. <br/><br/>Anyway, this round was all about strength and their ability to subdue monsters which he believed any of them could manage. <br/><br/>However, if they challenged Rank 4 Monsters, it would be a different story. <br/><br/>They could manage to win against weak to average strength Rank 4 monsters but might struggle with powerful ones. <br/><br/>With the Tianlong Clan as the organizers and their enmity towards his clan, it wouldn't be surprising if they sent their most powerful monsters of each rank against his clan's participants, just as they had done in the second round. <br/><br/>In any case, he didn't think that it would be necessary to fight with a Rank 4 monster as they were already in a lead with a considerable difference. <br/><br/>\"You three go and just enjoy yourself. No need to choose a Rank 4 monster. Just choose Rank 3 Monsters!\" <br/><br/>Feng Chen said.  S~eaʀᴄh the Novelƒire(.)ne*t website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>The three of them nodded excitedly, especially Feng Xiaoyu who hadn't had any chance to show off. <br/><br/>She thought she wouldn't be selected as she was self-aware that she was the weakest among the five participants from the Feng Clan. <br/><br/>But unexpectedly, Feng Chen gave her a chance. <br/><br/>\"Yes, Clan Leader!\" <br/><br/>The three participants Feng Chen selected—Feng Xiaoyu, Feng Mei, and Feng Jianhong—stepped forward, their expressions filled with confidence. <br/><br/>Every one of them had trained hard in the Astral Training Pavillion and dealing with monsters could be said to be easier than humans for them. <br/><br/>Of course, there was also a chance that they could encounter a monster that they had never fought but even then with their opponent being a Rank 3 monster, they didn't think it was anything to worry about. <br/><br/>The crowd leaned forward in their seats, eager to see who the Feng Clan had sent out. <br/><br/>They were very surprised when they didn't see Feng Yun. <br/><br/>\"Huh? Isn't Feng Yun their strongest participant? They are not sending him?\" <br/><br/>\"This… The Feng Clan is too arrogant!\" <br/><br/>\"What arrogant? They obviously are in the first place and there is no need to give their best unlike you. And who is to say that their other participants aren't powerful? At least, there is Feng Mei and Feng Jianhong who might be able to take on Rank 3 monsters.\" <br/><br/>… <br/><br/>The clans discussed with each other as having no Feng Yun was something that they didn't think of. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Icy Veil Sect paid close attention to the match, as both Feng Mei and Feng Xiaoyu—whom they were eager to recruit—were participating. <br/><br/>They were lucky to see firsthand what they were capable of. <br/><br/>\"So, who should go first?\" Feng Jianhong asked. <br/><br/>\"Hmm… Sister Xiaoyu, how about you?\" <br/><br/>Feng Mei thought for a while and saw Feng Xiaoyu's excitement. She thought it would be good if whoever is most excited gets to go first. Anyway, who goes first didn't really matter to them. <br/><br/>\"Ang?\" Feng Xiaoyu replied, caught off guard by the suggestion. <br/><br/>She thought for a while and nodded in agreement. <br/><br/>\"So, Sister Xiaoyu will go first, then I'll go second, and Brother Jianhong can go last. Does that work for you, Brother Jianhong?\" <br/><br/>\"Sure! No problem!\" <br/><br/>As the trio prepared for their turns, the atmosphere buzzed with anticipation. \"So, who will go first?\" <br/><br/>Tianlong Zhen asked, albeit a bit irritated. This was the participant from his enemy clan who cheated one million gold coins from them. <br/><br/>It would be more weird if he didn't have any reaction to them. <br/><br/>\"Me!\" <br/><br/>Feng Xiaoyu raised her hand and came forward nervously. It wasn't the fear of the monster she was about to face that made her nervous; it was the countless eyes upon her. <br/><br/>However, she took a deep breath and calmed her nerves. She was a member of Feng Clan and she couldn't disgrace her clan. <br/><br/>\"What rank of monster would you like to choose?\" <br/><br/>Tianlong Zhen asked. <br/><br/>\"Rank 3!\" <br/><br/>( Hmph! ) <br/><br/>Tianlong Zhen's lips curled into a smirk as he signaled to his subordinates. \"Bring in the monster!\" <br/><br/>The subordinate nodded with understanding. Indeed, they have prepared special monsters for the Feng Clan. <br/><br/>And with Feng Xiaoyu choosing the Rank 3 monster, Tianlong Zhen felt that this time Feng Clan would suffer and there was a chance that the Feng Clan would get Zero points in this round. <br/><br/>The crowd murmured in anticipation as the arena floor trembled slightly, signaling the approach of the beast. Heavy footfalls echoed, and the spectators leaned forward, eyes wide with excitement and curiosity. <br/><br/>This was perhaps the most powerful momentum shown by a monster so far. <br/><br/>Moments later, a massive Rank 3 monster lumbered into view. Its muscular form was covered in dark, scaly armor that shimmered under the bright arena lights. With glowing red eyes and sharp claws, it radiated an aura of menace that sent a thrill of apprehension through the crowd. This beast was known as a Bloodfang Beast, notorious for its fierce nature and relentless aggression. <br/><br/>Even among Rank 3 Monster, it was particularly known for its impenetrable defense which even some Grand Qi Condensation Realm cultivators find difficult to deal with. <br/><br/>\"Damn! This girl from Feng Clan is unlucky.\" <br/><br/>\"This Bloodfang Beast is something that even some Grand Qi Condensation Realm cultivators avoid.\" <br/><br/>\"Could it be that the Feng Clan would finally lose its first place?\" <br/><br/>… <br/><br/>The crowd muttered and thought that Feng Xiaoyu, who already looked nervous, would be defeated easily by such a powerful monster. <br/><br/>Feng Xiaoyu, however, stood her ground, a small smile creeping onto her face. The nervousness that had gripped her moments before began to fade, replaced by a flicker of recognition. <br/><br/>She took a step forward, her gaze fixed on the beast. <br/><br/>\"Isn't it the same monster that runs away from me?\"\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
