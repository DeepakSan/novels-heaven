Feng Chen stepped into the dumpling shop, only to be greeted by an unusual stillness. Despite the large number of patrons filling the tables, there was an air of tension that hung over the room. Conversations were hushed, and no waiter rushed over to greet him or take his order. It was as though everyone was on edge, waiting for something to happen. <br/><br/>He took a seat at one of the tables, trying to reason that perhaps the people of Qingyun City simply preferred a quieter atmosphere. However, deep down, he doubted that was the case. <br/><br/>The familiar, comforting scent of freshly steamed buns and rich broth filled the air, tugging at a distant memory. For a brief moment, Feng Chen was transported back to a simpler time—back to when his father brought him to this very place. He smiled, savoring the nostalgic feeling as the memory of his father's laughter echoed in his mind. <br/><br/>He smiled to himself, enjoying the moment of nostalgia, but was quickly pulled back to reality by a disturbance at the other end of the shop. His sharp senses immediately picked up on the voices. \"Come on, girl, don't make this difficult!\" One of the men sneered, his voice dripping with arrogance. \"Why don't you come with us? We'll show you around the city—give you the real Qingyun experience.\" <br/><br/>\"It'll be fun, I promise. Or would you rather we take you by force?\" <br/><br/>\"Hahaha… \" <br/><br/>A group of men were gathered around a girl, their rough words loud enough to draw attention. Feng Chen narrowed his eyes. While Qingyun City was generally safe, incidents like this weren't unheard of. He noticed that the other people in the restaurant were deliberately avoiding the situation, pretending not to see the group. Feng Chen also took note of their fine, expensive clothing. These men didn't seem like common thugs; they were more likely members of an influential clan from Qingyun City. <br/><br/>As Feng Chen assessed the situation, he rose from his seat. <br/><br/>While he wouldn't label himself as someone who constantly fought for justice, he was determined not to let a place filled with cherished memories be tarnished like this. At first, no one took notice of him, but as he approached the group of men, their attention gradually shifted, and they began to take note of his presence. <br/><br/>As he approached the group, his gaze locked onto the girl for the first time. <br/><br/>His heart skipped a beat! <br/><br/>She was breathtakingly beautiful, with soft, porcelain skin and large, expressive eyes that shimmered like pools of crystal water. Her long white hair, as pure as freshly fallen snow, cascaded down her back, framing her elegant features. Dressed in simple yet graceful robes, she had an air of quiet dignity, despite the unease she was clearly feeling. What struck him was her remarkable composure; she seemed to ignore the hooligans surrounding her as if they were nothing more than a passing nuisance. This unbothered demeanor only seemed to embolden the thugs, their crude taunts growing louder as they attempted to draw her attention. <br/><br/>Her beauty was not just skin-deep—there was something captivating about her aura as if she was more than she appeared. <br/><br/>This was the first time in his life that he had encountered someone as beautiful as her. Although he was confident he had seen many beauties throughout his lifetime, none compared to hers. <br/><br/>Feng Chen, for a brief moment, found himself staring. But he quickly shook off the distraction and turned his attention to the group of men. <br/><br/>( No wonder these scoundrels were so persistent in harassing her in broad daylight! ) <br/><br/>Feng Chen pondered this, but that didn't mean he would simply stand by and let it continue. <br/><br/>Besides, they had ruined his good mood, so he wasn't about to let them off the hook. <br/><br/>\"Is there a problem here?\" Feng Chen asked. <br/><br/>Feng Chen's question, though spoken calmly, sent a ripple through the crowd in the restaurant. The air grew thick with tension as people glanced nervously at him and the group of men. Some diners exchanged uneasy looks, while others kept their heads down, hoping to avoid being caught in whatever trouble was brewing. A few whispered under their breath, thinking that someone was going to be killed. <br/><br/>\"Oh no! This person is dead!\" <br/><br/>\"Fool! Does he even know who those people are?\" <br/><br/>\"Doesn't he know that they are members of the Tianlong Clan?\" <br/><br/>\"Who dares to go against the Tianlong Clan in Qingyun City? This guy is in serious trouble!\" <br/><br/>\"Seriously, just let it go. Messing with them is a death sentence! Why try to be a hero that no one will remember?\" <br/><br/>… <br/><br/>One of the older men sitting at a nearby table subtly raised a hand toward Feng Chen, motioning for him to stop. His expression was grave, and he gave a quick shake of his head, silently warning him. The hand gesture was unmistakable—it was a signal of danger, a message that said: \"These men are trouble, walk away, or you'll be killed.\" <br/><br/>But Feng Chen's eyes were locked on the group. He ignored the old man's caution, though he finally understood why these people were ignoring these hooligans. <br/><br/>( So, they are from the Tianlong Clan. No wonder! ) <br/><br/>Feng Chen thought. <br/><br/>After all, this city felt like the territory of the Tianlong Clan, and people tended to avoid antagonizing them. <br/><br/>Although he had some conflict with the Tianlong Clan, he didn't think that the Tianlong Clan would be this lawless. <br/><br/>Or maybe these guys are the only ones? <br/><br/>However, if those in power set a good example, such individuals wouldn't dare to act lawlessly in broad daylight. <br/><br/>In any case, Feng Chen didn't care whether these hooligans were from the Tianlong Clan or not. The man closest to the girl, who had been so confident moments ago, turned toward Feng Chen, his eyes narrowing at the interruption. \"Just go away when I am in a nice mood! Don't disturb us.\" <br/><br/>The man sneered. <br/><br/>Feng Chen met the man's glare with a calm expression. \"You're disturbing everyone here and,\" He replied evenly, taking a step closer. \"You are harassing the girl.\" <br/><br/>A ripple of tension spread through the restaurant as the patrons held their breath. As if it weren't enough to disturb them, now they believed Feng Chen's questioning was enough reason to warrant his death. <br/><br/>The man smirked, clearly unbothered by Feng Chen's words. \"And who are you to give orders?\" He spat, a hint of menace lacing his words. \"Do you think you can just waltz in here and play hero? You must be joking.\" <br/><br/>\"This is none of your business, friend. Why don't you go back to your meal before you get hurt?\" <br/><br/>The other man warned. <br/><br/>Feng Chen's eyes glinted dangerously, a cold smile forming on his lips. \"I'm not joking,\" Feng Chen shot back, his voice steady and firm. \"If you have any decency left, leave this restaurant!\" <br/><br/>\"Hmph! I was in a good mood and gave you a chance. Don't think we will let you off!\" <br/><br/>The first man growled, stepping forward as the air thickened with hostility. <br/><br/>The man signaled to his companions. They chuckled menacingly as they slowly approached Feng Chen. <br/><br/>The four men were all in the Core Formation Stage, and their talents were considered mediocre at best, especially by Tianlong Clan standards. <br/><br/>Given their age, it appeared they would remain stuck at that stage for the rest of their lives. <br/><br/>With sudden, fluid motions, they lunged forward. Feng Chen reacted before their fists and kicks rained down on him. Swiftly, he parried their attacks, countering with precise strikes that caught them off guard. <br/><br/>The restaurant erupted into chaos as patrons scrambled to their feet, some gasping in shock while others stood ready to witness the confrontation. <br/><br/>However, unlike what they thought, it didn't take more than a few seconds for Feng Chen to take care of these hooligans. <br/><br/>This surprised the patrons, however, it seems like Feng Chen wasn't just satisfied with that. <br/><br/>After swiftly neutralizing each hooligan one by one, Feng Chen continued to deliver a painful lesson. His strikes were precise and controlled, causing discomfort rather than severe injury, yet enough to make the hooligans writhe in pain. \"URGH!\" <br/><br/>\"ARGH! Please, stop!\" <br/><br/>\"I will not do that again! AHHH!\" <br/><br/>….  seaʀᴄh thё NôvelFire(.)net website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>Despite their pleas, Feng Chen showed no signs of relenting. <br/><br/>As the confrontation continued, spectators started to pity the hooligans, watching them endure Feng Chen's relentless punishment. <br/><br/>\"Leave now,\" Feng Chen said after beating them to his fill. \"If you don't, I'm more than willing to keep this going.\" <br/><br/>With a warning from Feng Chen, the hooligans, now thoroughly humbled and nursing their bruises, retreated hastily. If they didn't hurry, they didn't know whether the demon would change his mind and stop them. <br/><br/>As they reached the threshold of the restaurant, the first man, still smarting from his encounter with Feng Chen, turned back with a mix of resentment and wounded pride. His voice carried a hollow threat as he glanced over his shoulder. <br/><br/>\"You'll regret this!\" He muttered in a low voice, a trace of defiance in his tone before he turned and swaggered away. He wanted to say that loudly to save face, but he was scared Feng Chen would hear and stop him. So, he muttered something quietly to himself instead, just to satisfy his ego. <br/><br/>Feng Chen clearly heard his words but chose not to stop him. Feng Chen turned towards the girl, prepared to ask if she was alright. <br/><br/>But she was gone!\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
