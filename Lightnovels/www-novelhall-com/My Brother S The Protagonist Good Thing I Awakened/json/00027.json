What kind of luck do they have to secure a Second Grade Alchemist!\"<br/><br/>Elder Wei said angrily, slamming his fist on the table.<br/><br/>\"Our pill shops have already lost a significant amount of traffic,\" Elder Jinhai reported with a grim expression.<br/><br/>His voice was filled with frustration as he continued, \"Some of the merchants are getting anxious, and the number of customers has already dropped by 50 percent. If this continues, we might find ourselves struggling to maintain our position in the marketplace.\"<br/><br/>Although the only market that Yan Zhan targeted was pill shops, it would automatically affect other areas as well. It was because the Pill Shop was the core of their marketplace and many people only visited their marketplace because of the existence of their pill shop.<br/><br/>Now that Yan Clan is providing better and cheaper pills, many people are drifting towards their marketplace which in turn drops the profit for other shops like restaurants and clothing shops.<br/><br/>Elder Wei leaned forward, his voice low and urgent.<br/><br/>\"We need to take immediate action. If we don't find a way to regain our customers, the entire market could collapse. Should we consider lowering our prices? At least temporarily?\"<br/><br/>Elder Jinhai shook his head. \"Dropping prices might help in the short term, but without a Second Grade Alchemist, we can't match the quality or the quantity that the Yan Clan is providing. Even if we lower our prices, it won't be enough to draw customers back. They'll go where they can get better pills.\"<br/><br/>Elder Shu, who had been silent until now, spoke up.<br/><br/>\"Unless we secure our own Second Grade Alchemist, we won't be able to compete with the Yan Family. Our current alchemists are skilled, but they can only produce First Grade pills. We're losing ground because we simply can't meet the demand for higher-grade products.\"<br/><br/>The elders nodded in agreement, their expressions grim.<br/><br/>However, despite such a dire situation, Feng Chen wasn't worried in the slightest.<br/><br/>Rank-2 Pills? He could bring out ten thousand of them with his current System Points. But of course, he knew better than to waste System Points on such a small problem.<br/><br/>It was far better to utilize those points to raise his Family Alchemist level and have them produce Rank-2 pills.<br/><br/>Of course, it would take some time to do that even with System resources but he believed that in the long term, this method was most efficient.<br/><br/>Moreover, just a couple of days ago, he got a great item from the discounted store which will help Alchemist greatly.<br/><br/>(Although it cost me 50,000 System Points, looks like it is going to be worth it!)<br/><br/>Just then when Feng Chen was thinking that, Feng Yun, who had been quietly listening to the discussion, raised his hand.<br/><br/>The elders turned to look at him, curiosity piqued by the young man's sudden movement. \"Elders,\" Feng Yun began, his voice calm but firm.<br/><br/>\"I believe there might be a way to turn this situation around.\"<br/><br/>???<br/><br/>Feng Chen, who was immersed in his thinking, was brought back by Feng Yun's voice.. Listening to Feng Yun's words, some speculation began forming in his mind.<br/><br/>(Could it be...)<br/><br/>\"Speak, Yun'er. We're all ears.\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen said. He seemed to have already guessed what Feng Yun would say, although he wasn't entirely certain.<br/><br/>Feng Yun took a deep breath before continuing.<br/><br/>\"What if I told you that the Feng Clan already has someone capable of producing Rank-2 pills?\"<br/><br/>The room fell silent, the elders exchanging puzzled glances before looking back at Feng Yun. Elder Shu was the first to break the silence.<br/><br/>\"Yun'er, what do you mean? Are you suggesting that we have a Second Grade Alchemist among us?\"<br/><br/>Feng Yun nodded confidently. \"Yes, and that alchemist is me!\"<br/><br/>Shock rippled through the room. The elders, who had known Feng Yun since he was a child, found it hard to believe.<br/><br/>Elder Jinhai's eyes narrowed as he studied Feng Yun. \"You're saying that you, Feng Yun, have learned alchemy and have already reached the level of a second-grade alchemist? How is that possible?\"<br/><br/>Feng Yun smiled slightly. \"I've been dedicating myself to the study of alchemy in secret. I didn't want to reveal my progress until I was certain of my abilities. But given the current situation, I believe it's time to put my skills to use for the clan.\"<br/><br/>The room fell into stunned silence as the elders processed Feng Yun's words. The revelation was beyond anything they had expected.<br/><br/>The clan had been lamenting their lack of a Second Grade Alchemist, and here was Feng Yun, their own clan member, revealing that he might be able to fill that very role.<br/><br/>The elders exchanged looks of disbelief mixed with hope. Feng Yun's revelation was like a lifeline in the midst of a storm.<br/><br/>Elder Jinhai leaned forward, his eyes narrowing as he assessed Feng Yun.<br/><br/>\"This is a serious matter, Yun'er. If you can truly refine second-grade pills, it could turn the tide in our favor. But are you absolutely sure you can?\"<br/><br/>Although Elder Jinhai would love to believe his nephew, such things were beyond what he could trust just by the words.<br/><br/>Feng Yun nodded confidently. \"I am, Elder Jinhai. I wouldn't suggest this if I wasn't sure.\"<br/><br/>The elders were still not sure, with many still doubting Feng Yun's words. Of course, everyone knows Feng Yun wasn't a lair, it was just that it was hard to believe.<br/><br/>\"I believe that everyone might have some skepticism about this. So how about I show my skill and then you all can decide for yourself?\"<br/><br/>Feng Yun said. He knew that this was a hard fact to accept and he didn't blame them for not trusting him so easily.<br/><br/>Feng Chen, who had been observing quietly, finally spoke up, a mix of pride and curiosity in<br/><br/>his voice.<br/><br/>\"Let's not waste any more time speculating. If Yun'er says he can do it, then I believe him. Let's head to the Alchemist Room and see for ourselves. It's the best way to put any doubts to<br/><br/>rest.\"<br/><br/>(Looks like this kid's spirit is also an Alchemist.)<br/><br/>Feng Chen thought to himself as he firmly believed that this time crisis might easily be resolved by Feng Yun if things were as he thought.<br/><br/>The elders exchanged glances, their expressions filled with anticipation.<br/><br/>Elder Wei nodded. \"Agreed. Actions speak louder than words. If Feng Yun can truly refine a<br/><br/>Rank-2 pill, it will change everything.\"<br/><br/>With the decision made, the group quickly stood up and began making their way to the Feng S~eaʀᴄh the NôvelFire(.)net website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>Clan's Alchemist Room, where the clan's alchemists refined pills.<br/><br/>The atmosphere was tense but filled with a renewed sense of hope.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
