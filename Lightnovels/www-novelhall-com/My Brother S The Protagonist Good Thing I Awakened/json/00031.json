Sёarᴄh the nôvel_Fire.ηet website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>The Yan Clan's profits shrank by 80% compared to what they had been prior to the Feng Clan's counterattack.<br/><br/>The rapid turnover of the Feng Clan's pills had exceeded even their most optimistic predictions.<br/><br/>Every morning, crowds formed outside their shops, eager to purchase the Rank-2 and Rank-1 pills that were selling out by midday.<br/><br/>By the afternoon, the shelves were completely empty, and latecomers were left with no choice but to head to the Yan Clan's shop for less effective alternatives.<br/><br/>The Yan Clan struggled to maintain a foothold in the market.<br/><br/>The demand for their pills was sustained only by those who missed out on the Feng Clan's products, and their once-stronghold over the city's market was now a shadow of its former self.<br/><br/>***************<br/><br/>\"It's better to wait and see what happens.\"<br/><br/>Murmured one of the First-rated Clan leaders, watching the fierce competition unfold between the Feng Clan and the Yan Clan.<br/><br/>Many other clan leaders couldn't help but sigh and reconsider their intentions of allying with either clan. It was too early to take sides.<br/><br/>There were too many uncertainties, and choosing the wrong side could mean disaster for their family.<br/><br/>They didn't dare to gamble on a single outcome, nor did they want to risk their position and resources.<br/><br/>However, despite their hesitation to openly support one side over the other, they still needed to ensure access to quality pills for their own cultivation and healing needs.<br/><br/>\"Command down,\" one of the Clan Leaders instructed, turning to his aide.<br/><br/>\"Send the family member to the Feng Clan's pill shop as well as the Yan Clan's to queue up and purchase Rank-2 pills. As long as the pills are priced under 1000 Gold Coins, buy them all. Remember, bring more Gold Coins to the Feng Clan's side to make purchases.\"<br/><br/>The Rank-2 pills sold by Yan and Feng Clan were very profitable for them too. They could sell these pills for a much higher price in other cities where there is no Second Grade Alchemist.<br/><br/>Other Clan leaders of Misty Vale City also gave similar commands and tried to buy as many Rank-2 pills as possible.<br/><br/>They were not ready to choose sides, but they understood the importance of maintaining a supply of high-quality pills.<br/><br/>After all, how often could one buy a Rank-2 pill below 1000 gold coins?<br/><br/>In Misty Vale City, because of having no Second-Grade Alchemist previously, the only way was to buy the Rank-2 pills from higher-grade cities and that meant extra cost because of travel.<br/><br/>Travel wasn't cheap either as guards were needed to protect the carriage from bandits and monsters.<br/><br/>Therefore, if one were to take in all the costs, it would definitely cross 2000 Gold Coins and perhaps even more.<br/><br/>Thus, they decided to take advantage of when Yan and Feng Clan were competing and keeping the prices low.<br/><br/>They knew that the moment the other side gave up and exited the market, the other one would increase their price as shown by the Yan Clan.<br/><br/>So, when the competition was fierce with Pills' prices dropping, it was the best period to stock up on the pills, especially Rank-2 pills.<br/><br/>As for the alliance with Yan or Feng Clan, previously, many of the Clans considered joining with Yan Clan but then Feng Clan also showed that they have the support of Second Grade<br/><br/>Alchemists.<br/><br/>With this move, the Clans became much more weary as they couldn't afford to underestimate either Yan or Feng Clan who had Second Grade Alchemist.<br/><br/>Therefore, many of them choose to play safe and maintain neutrality while profiting from their competition.<br/><br/>*************<br/><br/>In the Feng Clan's meeting hall, Feng Chen sat with a calm demeanor, listening to the reports from his elders.<br/><br/>The atmosphere was buoyant, and smiles were spread across every face in the room. The overwhelming demand for their pills had brought a much-needed turnaround in their<br/><br/>fortunes.<br/><br/>\"Who would have thought that our new batch of Rank-2 pills would sell out so quickly?\"<br/><br/>Elder Feng Bao said with a wide grin, his eyes sparkling with excitement.<br/><br/>\"If not for Feng Yun's timely contribution of additional pills, we would have been completely<br/><br/>sold out for days!\"<br/><br/>\"Indeed! Yun'er has made a great contribution to the Clan.\"<br/><br/>Elder Wei agreed, his tone jubilant.<br/><br/>\"Our marketplace is busier now than it has ever been. The losses we suffered before have been entirely recouped. And with the sales from our new pills... the profit we've seen in the last few days alone is equivalent to what we used to make in months!\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen nodded, a smile tugging at his lips as he observed the excitement of his clan<br/><br/>members.<br/><br/>\"It's fortunate that we were able to source the ingredients for these pills in a matter of days.\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen mused, his tone becoming more serious.<br/><br/>\"However, we cannot let anyone figure out these ingredients, lest they try to sell it for more price or try to hog all the ingredients.\"<br/><br/>The elders nodded in agreement, recognizing the wisdom in Feng Chen's words.<br/><br/>At the moment, apart from some commonly used ingredients for Rank-2 pills, Feng Yun's Rank-2 pill ingredients were very cheap compared to other Rank-2 pills ingredients. \"Yes, those recipes of Feng Yuns are incredible. Not only are they better than what is on the current market but the ingredients are also not very expensive!\"<br/><br/>Elder Shu praised.<br/><br/>This is one of the reasons why they have such a high profit despite keeping the pills' price low.<br/><br/>\"Haha! Those bastards are trying to compete with us by lowering their prices as well, not knowing that the cost of production for our pills is extremely low. They must be running into<br/><br/>debt!\"<br/><br/>Elder Wei said.<br/><br/>To keep up with the Feng Clan, the Yan Clan had also decreased their price, however, even if<br/><br/>the two were to sell at the same price, the one losing was definitely the Yan Clan.<br/><br/>For one, there was the difference in the prices of the ingredients.<br/><br/>And the second was the success rate of refining the pills.<br/><br/>With the Ethereal Frost Flame, refining pills had become incredibly easy for Feng Yun,<br/><br/>resulting in both high yield and superior quality.<br/><br/>\"They underestimate us!\"<br/><br/>\"You mean they underestimated Feng Yun! Haha!\"<br/><br/>\"You are right! Haha...\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen glanced at the joyous faces of the elders, a smile forming on his own lips.<br/><br/>After all, without much intervention from himself, Feng Clan was able to defend against the Yan Clan who had the help of a Second Grade Alchemist.<br/><br/>However, he also knew that carelessness could lead to their doom.<br/><br/>\"The Yan Clan may have underestimated us, but we must not underestimate them. It is already weird that Yan Clan got help from a Rank-2 Alchemist.\"<br/><br/>The room fell silent for a moment, knowing the truth behind Feng Chen's words.<br/><br/>If not for Feng Yun this time, maybe they might have already been ruined by the Yan Clan.<br/><br/>Elder Feng Wei spoke up, his brow furrowed.<br/><br/>\"The Yan Clan's sudden access to a Second Grade Alchemist is troubling. But it shouldn't be Yan Clan's own alchemists... Their best alchemist is only at the Top-Level First Grade. It would be impossible for him to advance to Second Grade so quickly.\"<br/><br/>Elder Shu nodded in agreement.<br/><br/>\"Yes, with his current talent, such a rapid advancement seems unlikely. So if it's not their<br/><br/>alchemist, then who could this Second Grade Alchemist be?\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen's eyes narrowed thoughtfully.<br/><br/>\"It's most likely someone from outside the Yan Clan. Probably Elder Zhou or someone from<br/><br/>the Mystic Flame Sect. Both have the resources and connections to get a Second Grade<br/><br/>Alchemist.\"<br/><br/>Elder Shu looked concerned.<br/><br/>\"Indeed! Only they have the reason and resources to do so!\"<br/><br/>Elders were once again in a tense mood as they were once again reminded of the powerful<br/><br/>enemy that they had.<br/><br/>\"Regardless of who it is, we must remain vigilant. The Yan Clan may have external support, but we have our own strengths. We need to continue our efforts and be prepared for whatever they might throw at us.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
