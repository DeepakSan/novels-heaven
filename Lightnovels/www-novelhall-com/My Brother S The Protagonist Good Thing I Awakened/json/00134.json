Their reputation for efficiency had merchants willing to pay double the price just to acquire them. <br/><br/>It is said that thousands of pills from the Feng Clan could be sold out in a matter of minutes. <br/><br/>Although the exact quantity of pills wasn't visible, the jar alone suggested there could be hundreds, if not thousands, within. <br/><br/>\"This...\" <br/><br/>Even Zhu Shangxian hadn't expected the Feng Clan to prepare such an extravagant gift for his birthday. <br/><br/>These gifts could easily transform the Zhu Clan's standing. The artifact alone could double his combat strength, while the Elemental Ascension Pill held the potential for a breakthrough to the 'Three Elementals Divine Realm'. <br/><br/>Moreover, gifting such rare treasures casually only served to highlight the sheer power and wealth of the Feng Clan. <br/><br/>\"Oh my! Such a generous gift!\" <br/><br/>\"If only my children could catch the eye of someone from the Feng Clan.\" <br/><br/>\"Damn! Zhu Shangxian must have done something really good in his past life to receive such gifts.\" <br/><br/>…. <br/><br/>The murmurs among the crowd reflected their amazement, as few could fathom offering such valuable items so freely. <br/><br/>\"I would like to thank the Feng Clan for their generous gifts.\" Zhu Shangxian said, bowing slightly toward Elder Wei and Feng Chen. <br/><br/>For a brief moment, he considered declining the gifts, feeling they were far too extravagant. However, he quickly dismissed the thought. Refusing such a gesture could be interpreted as disrespect toward the Feng Clan. <br/><br/>After all, declining could imply that the Feng Clan couldn't afford to part with such treasures, or worse, it might be taken as an underestimation of their generosity. <br/><br/>\"Your thoughtfulness on this special occasion humbles me!\" He added. <br/><br/>The crowd erupted into whispers, marveling at the Feng Clan's display of wealth and goodwill. <br/><br/>Many merchants and clans present felt a renewed urgency to align themselves with the Zhu Clan, seeing how deeply Feng Chen valued their relationship. <br/><br/>After all, with the Elemental Ascension Pill, Zhu Shangxian now had a strong chance of breaking through to the Three Elementals Divine Realm, which would make him the strongest in Xianlong City. <br/><br/>Even without the breakthrough, the weapon alone secured his position as the city's most formidable figure. <br/><br/>And from the gifts given by the Feng Clan, one could tell that their relationship is very good, otherwise who could give such treasures? <br/><br/>Finally, the gift-giving concluded, and the hall settled into a quieter, more reflective atmosphere. <br/><br/>As the evening progressed, Zhu Shangxian took a moment to sit beside Feng Chen, his expression thoughtful. <br/><br/>\"Clan Leader Feng,\" Zhu Shangxian began, \"your presence tonight has done more than honor me—it has solidified my clan's standing in ways I couldn't have imagined.\" <br/><br/>\"There is no need to thank me. I merely came to attend the birthday celebration and have done nothing of significance.\" Feng Chen replied with a calm smile. \"However, there is a matter I'd like to discuss with you.\" <br/><br/>Zhu Shangxian immediately straightened, his expression growing serious. He knew that anything Feng Chen wanted to discuss would be of immense importance. <br/><br/>While he couldn't predict whether it would benefit his clan, the Feng Clan's gesture of goodwill tonight left him with no reason to hesitate. Moreover, being entrusted with any task by the Feng Clan could be seen as being under their wing—a position that would undoubtedly elevate the Zhu Clan's status within Xianlong City. <br/><br/>Feng Chen gave a subtle signal to Elder Wei, who stepped forward, his authoritative presence commanding attention. <br/><br/>Zhu Shangxian might be the leader of the Zhu Clan, but Elder Wei, as the most senior elder of the Feng Clan and a cultivator in the Grand Qi Condensation Realm, had no need to show excessive deference. <br/><br/>In fact, if one were to compare, Feng Wei would get much more respect from others than Zhu Shangxian.

Given this, we believe a mutually beneficial partnership can be established.\" <br/><br/>Zhu Shangxian's eyes narrowed slightly, his mind racing to anticipate the proposal. \"Please, Elder Wei, elaborate. The Zhu Clan would be honored to assist the Feng Clan in any way we can.\" <br/><br/>Elder Wei nodded approvingly. \"Our Feng Clan is well-known for the superior quality of its pills. While we have numerous channels for distribution across the Eastern Region, Xianlong City is one area where our presence has yet to solidify. We would like to entrust the Zhu Clan to handle the distribution of our pills within the city.\" <br/><br/>Zhu Shangxian's breath hitched. This was an unprecedented opportunity. <br/><br/>If the Zhu Clan became the official distributor of Feng Clan pills, their reputation would soar far beyond what even tonight's events could achieve. <br/><br/>Elder Wei continued, \"The arrangement is simple. We will supply your clan with a steady flow of Rank 1 and Rank 2 pills, along with occasional shipments of higher-grade pills based on demand. Your clan will handle their sale and distribution within Xianlong City. In return, the Feng Clan proposes a profit-sharing agreement—90% for us and 10% for your clan.\" <br/><br/>Zhu Shangxian immediately grasped the implications of the offer. <br/><br/>While the profit margin might seem modest, the sheer volume of trade these pills would generate would bring immense wealth to the Zhu Clan. <br/><br/>Additionally, gaining first access to the Feng Clan's highly sought-after pills would provide them with a critical edge in the market. <br/><br/>\"This is...\" Zhu Shangxian hesitated, choosing his words carefully. \"This is an extraordinary honor. To think that the Feng Clan would entrust us with such an important responsibility... I am deeply humbled.\" <br/><br/>Elder Wei's expression remained composed, but there was a faint glimmer of satisfaction in his eyes. \"We believe in choosing our partners wisely, Clan Leader Zhu. Your clan's integrity and influence make you an ideal choice.\" <br/><br/>Of course, the main reason is that his daughter is now part of the Zhu Clan, making it more fitting to entrust such business to them rather than anyone else. <br/><br/>Zhu Shangxian stood from his seat and bowed deeply toward both Feng Chen and Elder Wei. \"I assure you, the Zhu Clan will not disappoint. We will handle this responsibility with the utmost care and diligence.\" \t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
