She then took the seat directly beside Feng Chen. As she settled in, she subtly observed him, noting his complete lack of reaction. There was no flicker of emotion in his expression, no sign that her presence affected him in the slightest. <br/><br/>Bing Xue was used to others faltering before her beauty, regardless of their strength or age; even women often felt her aura's pull. Yet, seated so close, Feng Chen remained utterly composed, his face showing no trace of disturbance or admiration. This calmness surprised her more than she expected. <br/><br/>Bing Xue had anticipated a few flattering words from Feng Chen when she chose to approach the Feng Clan, but instead, she was met with silence. Realizing it would fall to her to initiate the conversation, she decided to break the quiet herself. <br/><br/>Turning to face him directly, she inclined her head in a courteous nod, her gaze steady and cool. <br/><br/>\"Feng Clan Leader!\" She began, her voice smooth and clear. \"I am Bing Xue, Sect Leader of the Icy Veil Sect. I've heard much about the strength of the Feng Clan and the talents it cultivates—especially the deeds of the Feng Clan Leader.\" <br/><br/>Her gaze lingered on Feng Chen with a hint of intrigue. \"Your reputation precedes you, Feng Clan Leader. Indeed,\" Bing Xue continued, her tone cool but appraising, \"it appears you truly possess the strength and talent I have heard so much about.\" <br/><br/>Feng Chen gave a faint smile, nodding in acknowledgment. \"You're not bad yourself, Sect Leader Bing Xue!\" At his words, a few of the Icy Veil Sect elders stiffened, their expressions tinged with displeasure. To the elders, Feng Chen's casual remark felt dismissive of their highly revered sect leader. To them, saying she was \"not bad\" seemed an insult, implying a lack of recognition of her true strength. After all, how could anyone dare to say \"not bad\" to a Nascent Soul Realm cultivator, one of the most powerful figures in the Azure Sky Empire? <br/><br/>However, they couldn't interfere in their leader's conversation, especially since it involved someone whose exceptional talent they were hoping to recruit. It was a crucial opportunity for them, and they needed to tread carefully before making any comments. <br/><br/>Bing Xue only maintained her calm, offering a slight, unreadable smile in return. <br/><br/>She was of course surprised at how calm Feng Chen still was. She still couldn't read his expression but she didn't feel like he was looking down at her but at the same time didn't seem to fear or revere her. <br/><br/>After that bit of conservation, there was once again silence in the hall. <br/><br/>Most of the onlookers had shifted their attention to the Icy Veil Sect, driven either by curiosity or the desire to catch a glimpse of the Ice Fairy. As a result, the number of people watching the Heavenly Projection Crystal dwindled to just ten or twenty. <br/><br/>Another factor contributing to this decline in interest was the lack of excitement about the crystal itself. The participants were merely attacking the formation, attempting to solve it, or struggling against its challenges. In comparison, the allure of the Icy Veil Sect's presence far outweighed the mundane spectacle unfolding on the crystal. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, despite her curiosity about Feng Chen, the Ice Fairy remained focused on her mission. <br/><br/>Her eyes, like twin pools of frozen crystal, lingered on Feng Mei, assessing her with a keen gaze that seemed to cut straight to her core. Looking at her Mid-Level Core Formation Stage, Bing Xue knew that Feng Mei was really talented. <br/><br/>\"Feng Mei!\" Bing Xue's voice was soft but resolute, resonating with authority. \"I have heard of your remarkable talent. The Icy Veil Sect values individuals with exceptional potential, and I believe you would be an excellent fit among us.\" <br/><br/>Feng Mei looked up, momentarily caught off guard, her expression a mixture of surprise and intrigue. She had not anticipated such an offer—especially not from the legendary leader of the Icy Veil Sect herself. Of course, Feng Chen has already talked to her about the possibility that Sects might try to recruit her but she didn't expect the legendary Ice Fairy to be the one. <br/><br/>Though even with her being the Ice Fairy, Feng Mei wasn't going to right away accept the offer especially since that meant that she would need to be separated from Feng Yun. <br/><br/>Bing Xue sensed the hesitation and continued, her tone softer. \"I will personally take you on as my disciple, and in the future, you may very well become the sect leader of the Icy Veil Sect. With your exceptional talent and my guidance, you could achieve heights beyond anything you can imagine.\" <br/><br/>Bing Xue tries to entice Feng Mei by saying that she might become the next sect leader though there is no telling whether that will happen or not.

This was also her first time taking on a disciple since becoming the sect leader. With Feng Mei's exceptional talent, everyone in the Icy Veil Sect believed that only she had the capability to nurture someone with the same potential as Ling Meiyu. <br/><br/>Feng Mei was obviously enticed because she had looked up to Ice Fairy and knew about her deeds. <br/><br/>Every girl including her dreams about someday becoming like Ice Fairy. However, the thought of separating from Feng Yun obviously stopped her from accepting her offer. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the other people who heard Ice Fairy's words were stunned. <br/><br/>Although they have seen Feng Mei talent with their own eyes, they still can't believe that she would get the opportunity to become a personal disciple of Ice Fairy and even promise of becoming future Sect Leader. <br/><br/>Many girls couldn't help but become jealous and envious of Feng Mei. This is what they dream of but Feng Mei easily achieves their dream. <br/><br/>Grand Elder Ren Daoyu's face grew even darker as he watched the scene unfold, clenching his fists under his sleeves. He had harbored similar ambitions for his own clan's disciples, but it was evident that the Icy Veil Sect's standards were beyond his reach. The only saving grace was that their target was Feng Mei and not Feng Yun. <br/><br/>Seeing Feng Mei's hesitation, Bing Xue shifted her gaze to Feng Chen, a new idea sparking in her mind. <br/><br/>\"Feng Clan Leader,\" she said, her tone shifting to one of authority and determination. \"I believe that with my guidance, Feng Mei could achieve unparalleled heights including becoming a Nascent Soul Realm cultivator. Under my mentorship, she would be molded into a powerhouse, someone who will stand first in the Dragon and Phoenix Ranking.\" <br/><br/>Her words hung in the air, resonating with the weight of possibility. She intended to persuade Feng Chen to encourage Feng Mei, believing that becoming her disciple would be the best choice for her and his clan's future. <br/><br/>\"I will ensure she becomes powerful, a true asset to the Icy Veil Sect. Together, we can cultivate her talent and shape her into the best version of herself.\" <br/><br/>Bing Xue's eyes glinted with ambition as she laid out her vision, hoping to persuade both Feng Chen and Feng Mei with the promise of greatness. <br/><br/>Though unlike her expectations, Feng Chen didn't think much about her offer. Making her come first in the Dragon and Phoenix Ranking? <br/><br/>He could do that as well without even trying. <br/><br/>Nascent Soul Realm? <br/><br/>What was that? He believed that as long as given time, he could make each and every clan member become one. <br/><br/>However, he also recognized the advantages of Feng Mei becoming a personal disciple of the Icy Veil Sect. Their once-weak clan had left the younger generation sheltered and inexperienced, with much to learn about the world. Joining the Icy Veil Sect could provide Feng Mei with invaluable insights and experiences that would broaden her horizons. <br/><br/>Moreover, they were no longer young and needed to spread their wings. Going to Icy Veil Sect will give her much-needed experience. <br/><br/>Finally, Feng Chen looked toward Bing Xue. \"Sect Leader Bing Xue, this is a great honor, one we do not take lightly. Feng Mei would be fortunate to cultivate under your guidance. However,\" Bing Xue was happy when Feng Chen said those words, almost thinking that he was going to agree until she heard 'however'. <br/><br/>\"She is also deeply attached to her family and her clan. I would like to consult with her before any final decisions are made.\" <br/><br/>Bing Xue regarded him with an understanding nod. She didn't think that Feng Chen would value Feng Mei's will over his clan's interest. <br/><br/>Having Feng Mei become her disciple would undoubtedly benefit the Feng Clan, yet he chose to prioritize Feng Mei's feelings over the clan's interests, which undeniably warmed her heart a little. <br/><br/>After all, in a world that prioritizes strength above all else, it is rare for someone to value an individual's well-being over their clan's interests.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
