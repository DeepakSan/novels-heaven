Both missions completed at the same time?\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen was surprised to see that both clan missions had been completed simultaneously. \"Did Feng Jianhong make a breakthrough?\"<br/><br/>Feng Jianhong was already close to breaking through to the Core Formation Stage previously and with the pill that Feng Yun gave to him for his breakthrough, Feng Chen speculated that he was successful.<br/><br/>Not only did this cause Mission 1 to be completed, but it also completed Mission 2 since there were already 29 Core Formation Stage cultivators in the clan before he broke through.<br/><br/>\"What a luck!\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen felt very lucky and decided to reward Feng Jianghon later.<br/><br/>First, he needed to check all the rewards he had received from the System.<br/><br/>There were lots of things that System rewarded him but the thing that caught his eye the most was 'Basic Sword Intent'.<br/><br/>He knew just how precious this reward was! Searᴄh the Nôvel(F)ire.nёt website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>Feng Chen had heard stories about powerful sword cultivators who could command the wind and sever mountains with a mere swing of their swords, all thanks to their mastery of Sword Intent.<br/><br/>Awakening Sword Intent was considered one of the most difficult milestones for a sword cultivator.<br/><br/>To achieve it, one needed to forge a deep connection with their sword, treating it as an extension of themselves.<br/><br/>It wasn't just about mastering sword techniques; it was about understanding the essence of the sword and becoming one with it.<br/><br/>This required years, sometimes decades, of solitary training, endless battles, and an unyielding spirit.<br/><br/>Moreover, the power of Sword Intent was no trivial matter. Even at the Basic level, it was known to increase a sword cultivator's attack power by at least 20%.<br/><br/>For someone like Feng Chen, who was already strong, this enhancement could make a huge difference in battle.<br/><br/>With Basic Sword Intent, his sword strikes would carry more power, cut deeper, and move faster.<br/><br/>It was a significant boost that could turn the tide in any confrontation.<br/><br/>Taking a deep breath, Feng Chen focused his mind and clicked on the Basic Sword Intent.<br/><br/>[ Does Host wish to integrate with the Sword Intent?]<br/><br/>The System asked with his usual mechanical voice.<br/><br/>\"Yes!\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen said decisively.<br/><br/>A surge of energy flowed through Feng Chen's body as soon as he confirmed his choice.<br/><br/>It was as if a powerful current had been unleashed, coursing through his veins and awakening every muscle fiber in his body.<br/><br/>His senses sharpened, and his perception of the sword in his hand became incredibly clear.<br/><br/>The sensation was intense, and Feng Chen gritted his teeth, enduring the overwhelming force of the integration.<br/><br/>It felt as though a thousand blades were being honed within him, each one sharpening his understanding of the sword's essence.<br/><br/>\"АННН!\"<br/><br/>The pain was excruciating but exhilarating at the same time. This was the path of a true sword cultivator, a path of trials and perseverance.<br/><br/>Time seemed to pass quickly as Feng Chen integrated with the Sword Intent!<br/><br/>Gradually, the pain subsided, replaced by a warm, pulsating energy that spread throughout his body.<br/><br/>Feng Chen opened his eyes, and they shone with a brilliant light.<br/><br/>He could feel it-the Basic Sword Intent. It was like an invisible aura around him, a presence that was both fierce and serene.<br/><br/>Testing his newfound power, Feng Chen picked up his sword and swung it gently.<br/><br/>-SLASH!<br/><br/>The air seemed to part before the blade as if recognizing its authority. His movements were smoother and more precise, and the power behind each swing was undeniable.<br/><br/>He felt an effortless connection with the sword as if it had become an extension of his own<br/><br/>will.<br/><br/>\"Incredible,\" Feng Chen whispered to himself, marveling at the transformation.<br/><br/>\"This is the true power of Sword Intent.\"<br/><br/>The room was filled with an intense, vibrating energy as he cultivated the newly acquired Sword Intent, his Qi circulating rapidly within his meridians.<br/><br/>Suddenly, Feng Chen's eyes shifted to look at a very long distance. His brows furrowed as he sensed a massive fluctuation of Qi coming from the direction of the marketplace.<br/><br/>The energy signatures were unmistakably those of his Grand Elders.<br/><br/>However, they were not alone and a multitude of other formidable auras accompanied them, which he thought must have belonged to the Yan, Zhao, and Liu Clans.<br/><br/>\"Looks like those idiots couldn't wait any longer!:\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen muttered, his eyes narrowing with killing intent.<br/><br/>He thought that those Major Families would be clever enough to not provoke the Feng Clan<br/><br/>but you can't just underestimate the stupidity of these villains.<br/><br/>Even if you gave them some leeway, they would find some excuse to get themselves killed.<br/><br/>Without wasting a second, he stood up, his Qi condensing around him like protective armor. \"Let's greet those intruders as well!\"<br/><br/>In a flash, Feng Chen moved, his figure disappearing from his chamber as he rushed toward the source of the conflict.<br/><br/>******<br/><br/>In the place which was formerly an alley, Elder Zhou Tianhua and Elder Zhou Lei made their<br/><br/>appearance.<br/><br/>Although Elder Zhou Lei attracted some attention from the Feng Clan's Grand Elders and onlookers, it was Elder Zhou Tianhua who truly commanded everyone's focus.<br/><br/>\"Tsk! I didn't think that you all would require my help this quickly!\"<br/><br/>Elder Zhou Tianhua's voice rang out, dripping with disdain as he assessed the situation.<br/><br/>He originally thought that he would only need to take care of Feng Chen and rest would be<br/><br/>done by others.<br/><br/>However, they were losing so badly that he had no choice but to show himself.<br/><br/>Everybody could feel the pressure emitted by Elder Zhou Tianhua and knew that he was someone who had surpassed the Grand Qi Condensation Realm.<br/><br/>\"Three Elements Divine Realm?\"<br/><br/>Feng Zhenshan muttered as he finally understood why Yan Zhan was so confident even when<br/><br/>he was losing.<br/><br/>(So, they were helped by such a powerful person!)<br/><br/>Feng Zhenshan thought.<br/><br/>\"Who is this esteemed person? He seemed to have surpassed the Grand Qi Condensation<br/><br/>Realm.\"<br/><br/>\"Hmmm... Judging by the fact that he was accompanied by Elder Zhou Lei, he must be his brother, Elder Zhou Tianhua.\"<br/><br/>\"Elder Zhou Tianhua, who is not only in the Three Elements Divine Realm but also Second Grade Alchemist? No wonder, Yan Clan was able to produce Rank-2 pills as they had his<br/><br/>support.\"<br/><br/>\"Indeed! Looks like the Feng Clan's fate is sealed today.\"<br/><br/>Many onlookers were overwhelmed by the presence of the Three Elements Divine Realm<br/><br/>cultivator.<br/><br/>It was an incredibly rare chance to see Three Elements Divine Realm Cultivators, especially for the people of Misty Vale City.<br/><br/>Just as Elder Zhou Lei and Elder Zhou Tianhua made their appearances, Feng Chen also arrived<br/><br/>at the scene.<br/><br/>Looking at the overconfident Elder Zhou Tianhua, Feng Chen can't help but smile.<br/><br/>(Unless they are slapped, people tend to believe that they are invincible.)<br/><br/>This was the same case for Elder Zhou and it seemed like it was the same for Elder Zhou<br/><br/>Tianhua.<br/><br/>\"Let's get this over with then!\"\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
