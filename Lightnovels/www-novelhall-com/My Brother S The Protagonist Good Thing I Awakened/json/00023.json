Cheers, gasps, and shouts of disbelief echoed throughout the arena.<br/><br/>\"Feng Yun won! He really won!\"<br/><br/>\"This is unbelievable! Feng Yun defeated a Core Formation cultivator!\"<br/><br/>\"How can someone at the Foundation Establishment Stage be this powerful?\"<br/><br/>\"Damn! Feng Clan is going to rise.\"<br/><br/>\"16 years old and he already defeated the Core Formation Stage. Feng Yun is definitely considered a genius by those first-rated Sect.\"<br/><br/>The members of the Feng Clan, who had been watching with bated breath, let out collective sighs of relief and pride.<br/><br/>Their second young master had just accomplished something extraordinary, something that would be talked about for years to come.<br/><br/>On the other side, the Yan Clan was in disarray. Their pride and joy, Yan Zhihao, had been utterly defeated in front of the entire city.<br/><br/>The humiliation was so much so that Yan Zhan's face turned ashen.<br/><br/>His hands trembled with barely suppressed rage, but there was nothing he could do. The match was over, and the outcome was undeniable.<br/><br/>Feng Chen's smug expression grew even more pronounced as he turned to Yan Zhan.<br/><br/>\"Well, Yan Zhan, it seems that our Yun has won. Thirty thousand gold coins-don't forget to pay up.\"<br/><br/>Yan Zhan's face twisted in anger, but he knew he had no choice.<br/><br/>The bet had been made publicly, and backing out now would only bring further shame to the Yan Clan. Gritting his teeth, he managed a stiff nod.<br/><br/>\"You'll get your gold coins, Feng Chen. But don't think this is over.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, I'm sure it's not,\" Feng Chen replied smoothly, \"but for now, I'll enjoy this victory.\"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Feng Yun sheathed his sword, his eyes briefly scanning the crowd.<br/><br/>He could see the shock and admiration in their gazes, but it didn't let affect him.<br/><br/>For 16 years, Feng Yun had been the target of scorn and ridicule, labeled as \"Trash\" because he couldn't cultivate like the others.<br/><br/>The whispers, the mocking laughter, the pitying glances-they had all cut deep, leaving scars that no one could see.<br/><br/>He had been the disappointment of the Feng Clan, the one everyone thought would never amount to anything.<br/><br/>But as he stood in the center of the arena, victorious, the very people who once looked down on him were now staring in shock and awe.<br/><br/>Yet, despite their newfound admiration, Feng Yun didn't feel the need to celebrate or be happy.<br/><br/>He had grown beyond the need for approval, no longer seeking validation from those who once treated him like trash.<br/><br/>\"Feng Yun! Feng Yun!\"<br/><br/>\"Feng Yun! Feng Yun!\"<br/><br/>The crowd erupted around him, their cheers and shouts filling the air, but Feng Yun remained calm.<br/><br/>He had learned long ago not to let the opinions of others control his emotions. He wasn't here to impress them or bask in their applause.<br/><br/>He was here because he had worked tirelessly, pushing through every setback, every insult, every moment of despair-not just for himself, but to repay the unwavering support of his brother.<br/><br/>As he glanced at Yan Zhihao, lying defeated on the ground, there was no gloating, no arrogance-just his usual calmness.<br/><br/>Feng Yun turned and walked away, his heart steady. He knew this was just the beginning. He still has to get stronger than Ling Meiyu.<br/><br/>\"Hehe... Feng Head, your younger brother, is indeed a hidden dragon among men. Congratulations on winning the Annual Genius Competition!\"<br/><br/>Wang Yifan complimented Feng Yun.<br/><br/>\"Indeed, the Feng family has produced such a heavenly pride. It's truly enviable!\"<br/><br/>\"Feng Head, My daughter, Xiaoling, is of marriageable age and has been admired by everyone for her beauty and character. Perhaps we could discuss marriage with your brother.\"<br/><br/>\"My niece, Ling'er, is also quite accomplished and would make a fine match for a rising star like Feng Yun.\"...<br/><br/>Several Clan leaders made their way towards Feng Chen as they began to praise Feng Yun with many suggesting marrying their descendant to Feng Yun.<br/><br/>Everyone can see that Feng Yun has very good potential and will definitely become a powerful person in the future.<br/><br/>Reaching the Mid-Level Foundation Establishment Stage at 16, it was talent comparable to those geniuses recruited by strong Sect.<br/><br/>Knowing that, how could they miss the opportunity to rope in Feng Yun?<br/><br/>Of course, Feng Chen couldn't agree to any of those requests, and he politely declined them.<br/><br/>(Humph! Want to marry Feng Yun after showing his talent? Do you all deserve it?)<br/><br/>How could he agree with all these people who previously scorn and disdain Feng Yun?<br/><br/>Moreover, how could he make Feng Yun engage after what happened previously with Ling Meiyu?<br/><br/>He thought it was better for Feng Yun to just marry the girl he likes instead of being a medium to connect to another family.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Zhao, Yan, and Liu Families had already exited the arena. There was no way that they could handle being there, listening to people praise the Feng Clan.<br/><br/>Yan Zhan, in particular, looked furious, his face a storm of frustration and barely contained<br/><br/>rage.<br/><br/>As the three families gathered just outside the arena, away from prying eyes, Yan Zhan's gaze darted around to ensure no one was eavesdropping.<br/><br/>\"Zhao Chenxi, Liu Yingjie,\" he began, his voice low and seething with anger, \"I believe we all understand what just happened today. The Feng Clan... they've become a threat that we can't Sёarᴄh the nôᴠel Fire.nёt website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>afford to ignore.\"<br/><br/>\"If we leave them be, there might come another Feng Chen from Feng Clan.\"<br/><br/>Zhao Chenxi's eyes narrowed, and Liu Yingjie nodded, both understanding the implications of Yan Zhan's words.<br/><br/>Feng Chen was 18 when he entered the Annual Genius Competition and won while Feng Yun is just 16 with even greater potential.<br/><br/>They knew that if they let Feng Yun survive, he could very well advance to the Three Element Divine Realm in the future.<br/><br/>By then, they wouldn't be able to do anything to the Feng Clan and might even get swallowed<br/><br/>by the Feng Clan.<br/><br/>\"Agreed,\" Zhao Chenxi said, his tone equally measured.<br/><br/>\"But we can't move against them directly. The Feng Clan still has Feng Chen.\"<br/><br/>\"Indeed,\" Liu Yingjie added.<br/><br/>\"Although their younger generation has shown great talent, they are still fledglings,\" Liu<br/><br/>Yinjie remarked, his voice dripping with disdain.<br/><br/>\"They may have potential, but they are far from becoming a threat to us. However, Feng Chen<br/><br/>is a different story. We three together might not be able to take him down.\"<br/><br/>Liu Yinjie said. Although he was arrogant, he still knew the power that Feng Chen had. Not everyone can knock out Elder Zhou in one move like Feng Chen.<br/><br/>\"Hehe... For that, I already have a plan!\"<br/><br/>Yan Zhan said with confidence.<br/><br/>\"What?\" Liu Yinjie and Zhao Chenxi asked, not able to contain their curiosity. If they could take down<br/><br/>Feng Chen, then taking down Feng Clan is just a matter of time.<br/><br/>Yan Zhan's grin widened, his eyes gleaming with malevolent intent.<br/><br/>\"Patience, my friends. You'll know later.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
