Word of their victory at the Eastern Gathering had spread like wildfire, and a sizable crowd had gathered to welcome them. Wang Yifan stood at the forefront of the welcoming party, flanked by several officials and local cultivators. Though his smile was broad, a flicker of nervousness crossed his face as his eyes fell upon Feng Chen. <br/><br/>Wang Yifan didn't think that Feng Clan would really come first place in the Eastern Gathering. He just hoped that they could do better than the Yan Family. <br/><br/>But now, he has come to know that the Feng Clan has been on the decline and has become the number one in the Eastern Region, he couldn't help but be nervous. <br/><br/>\"Patriarch Feng! Congratulations on your glorious victory!\" Wang Yifan greeted, bowing deeply. Behind him, the officials and guards mirrored his actions, their respect almost palpable. <br/><br/>With Feng Clan's victory, they will naturally obtain many resources, and the development of Misty Vale City will also improve. <br/><br/>\"City Lord Wang, you're too kind. There's no need for you to go to such lengths.\" <br/><br/>Feng Chen said. He didn't expect that so many people would be there to congratulate them. <br/><br/>Wang Yifan straightened his posture, his smile becoming more pronounced as he replied. <br/><br/>\"Patriarch Feng, you are being modest. As the City Lord, it is my duty to personally welcome those who bring immense pride and honor to Misty Vale City. Your victory at the Eastern Gathering has elevated not just the Feng Clan but the standing of our city within the entire region.\" His tone was respectful yet firm, signaling his genuine appreciation. \"Moreover, the resources and recognition your clan has secured will undoubtedly contribute to the development of Misty Vale City. For that, we owe you a great debt of gratitude.\" Feng Chen nodded slightly, acknowledging the gesture. Wang Yifan continued, his voice loud enough for all to hear. \"In light of your extraordinary achievements, I, Wang Yifan, declare that for the next three years, the Feng Clan shall be exempt from paying any city taxes. This is but a small token of appreciation for all you have done for Misty Vale City.\" A wave of murmurs spread through the crowd, followed quickly by cheers and applause. The gesture was significant, and the people of Misty Vale City recognized it as a well-deserved acknowledgment of the Feng Clan's success. After all, securing first place at the Eastern Gathering would bring immense resources to Misty Vale City from the royal family's allocation. Exempting the Feng Clan from taxes was the least they could offer in return. Besides, the tax revenue from the Feng Clan was negligible compared to the substantial resources the city would now receive for its victory. <br/><br/>\"City Lord Wang, we are grateful for your generosity. The Feng Clan will continue to strive for excellence and contribute to the prosperity of Misty Vale City.\" Feng Chen said gratefully. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Feng Zhenshan and Feng Zhilan couldn't hide their broad smiles at the prospect of a tax exemption. The Feng Clan was no longer the struggling house it once was; their income was now measured in tens or even hundreds of thousands of gold coins. A tax exemption would mean saving hundreds of thousands of gold coins—a significant boost to their clan's coffers. <br/><br/>As the carriage rolled further into the city, several other prominent figures stepped forward to offer their congratulations. Not far behind, representatives from smaller clans and sects also came forward to offer their congratulations, their motives ranging from genuine admiration to thinly veiled attempts to curry favor with the now-famous Feng Clan. <br/><br/>Feng Chen accepted their praise with a faint smile. Many families were eager to propose marriage alliances, particularly for Feng Yun and Feng Chen. Feng Chen, as the head of the Feng Clan, was an obvious choice. Securing a bond with him would mean forging a powerful alliance and gaining the full backing of the Feng clan. Feng Yun, on the other hand, was celebrated for his extraordinary potential and widely recognized as possessing a number aptitude for cultivation. His achievement at the Pillar of Aptitude had spread far and wide. Why wouldn't it? The very fiancée who once annulled their engagement for being \"unworthy\" had her record shattered by the same man she dismissed—a poetic twist. <br/><br/>The very same people who once mocked Feng Yun as a toad coveting swan meat had now completely reversed their stance. They were quick to claim that Ling Meiyu was unworthy of someone like Feng Yun, criticizing her for failing to recognize his extraordinary potential when she had the chance. In any case, Feng Chen didn't care much about it and also declined their offer. <br/><br/>Feng Chen believed that marriage should be a personal decision, one made by the individuals involved. He didn't want another situation like Feng Yun's. <br/><br/>As for himself, marriage was the furthest thing from his mind. There had yet to be any girl who could capture his heart. <br/><br/>The Feng Clan procession slowly made its way toward the clan estate, drawing an excited crowd behind them. As they entered, the celebratory atmosphere intensified, with the sky above filled with vibrant fireworks that illuminated the night. Drums echoed through the air, signaling the triumphant return of the clan's heroes. <br/><br/>At the estate, a lavish feast awaited, the tables laden with rich delicacies and wine flowing in abundance. The entire clan had gathered to celebrate, their faces beaming with pride and excitement. <br/><br/>As Feng Chen, Feng Yun, and the others dismounted and made their way into the estate, members of the clan eagerly came forward to congratulate them, each voice filled with respect and admiration. \"Young Master Feng Yun, your achievements are truly incredible! Your name is on everyone's lips after what you did at the Pillar of Aptitude.\" <br/><br/>\"Sister Mei, your performance at the Eastern Gathering was nothing short of dazzling. The future of our clan is in good hands with you.\" <br/><br/>\"Sister Xiaoyu, you've truly grown since the last time I saw you. Your strength is now unquestionable!\" <br/><br/>\"Brother Liang, congratulations on becoming Rank 2 Formation Master. You should be the youngest to become the Rank 2 Formation Master. Many Sect have sent invitations to you.\" <br/><br/>… <br/><br/>The praise continued as Feng Liang, Feng Yun, Feng Mei, and Feng Xiaoyu received their share of compliments as well, and the atmosphere filled with admiration and joy. They responded humbly, each offering words of gratitude as their fellow clan members congratulated them. <br/><br/>However, as the congratulations flowed in, there was one person who noticed a peculiar silence around him. Feng Jianhong stood to the side, smiling awkwardly as everyone else was showered with praise. <br/><br/>It didn't take long for his patience to wear thin. He cleared his throat loudly and blurted out. \"Wait a minute… What about me? Why is nobody congratulating me on my great deeds?!\" <br/><br/>\"HaHa… What are you talking about, Jianhong? We didn't hear anything about you.\" <br/><br/>Someone said. <br/><br/>\"What? My deed of climbing to the 14th step in Pillar Of Aptitude and defeating a Rank 3 Monster. How can those things be ignored?\" <br/><br/>Feng Jianhong asked in anger. <br/><br/>The others overheard his words, and a ripple of laughter swept through the crowd. <br/><br/>\"Of course, your great deeds have been heard loud and clear.\" <br/><br/>\"Yes, we were just messing with you. We all heard about your exceptional performance at Pillar Of Aptitude.\" \"Congratulations, Jianhong! You made our clan proud!\" <br/><br/>… <br/><br/>\"Sheesh! You scared me. I thought that my deeds weren't great enough!\" <br/><br/>Feng Jianhong said, wiping his brow theatrically as if he were wiping away sweat. <br/><br/>Of course, others were just messing with him and knew about his performance in the Eastern region which surprised many of them. <br/><br/>They never thought that Feng Jianhong's aptitude would be greater than Feng Xiaoyu and Feng Liang. <br/><br/>But just like how he kept messing with them, they decided to take this moment to also mess with him. <br/><br/>The teasing settled, and the mood lightened as the celebration continued. The Feng Clan gathered around, enjoying a grand feast filled with laughter, food, and wine. \t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
