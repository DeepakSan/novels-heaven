Even the Imperial Family has to give some face to such individuals.<br/><br/>Feng Chen returned to his room, contemplating the purchase of a formation from the System to keep his cultivation hidden.<br/><br/>He was wary of potential spies sent by his enemies and knew he needed to hide his true strength to avoid drawing the attention of even more powerful enemies.<br/><br/>After browsing through the System store, he found what he was looking for: the \"Heavenly Veil Formation.\"<br/><br/>Heavenly Veil Formation:<br/><br/>Grade: 5<br/><br/>Function: Enhances cultivation speed by 50%, conceals all activities within the formation, and provides a barrier against external detection.<br/><br/>Cost: 50,000 System Points<br/><br/>Feng Chen didn't hesitate and immediately brought it. The cost was significant, but the benefits were too great to ignore.<br/><br/>He confirmed the purchase and decided right away to set up the formation. A surge of energy enveloped him as the formation was integrated into his room.<br/><br/>He immediately felt the change. The air inside the room became richer with spiritual energy, and a faint, shimmering barrier formed around the space, making it impossible for anyone to sense what was happening inside.<br/><br/>Feng Chen smiled, satisfied with his investment.<br/><br/>\"Alright! Now, I can cultivate without any worries.\"<br/><br/>Sitting cross-legged in the center of the room, Feng Chen began his cultivation. The enhanced energy flow was palpable.<br/><br/>His breathing synchronized with the rhythmic pulse of the formation, and he could feel his cultivation base stabilizing and strengthening.<br/><br/>The gap between the Three Elements Divine Realm and the Nascent Soul Realm seemed a little less daunting now.<br/><br/>After cultivating for many hours, Feng Chen felt exhausted, yet his spirits were high with excitement.<br/><br/>\"It's time to use this,\" he said, taking out a vial of Pure Essence Fluid.<br/><br/>This was the first gift that System gave him as a newbie.<br/><br/>Feng Chen uncorked the vial, the clear, shimmering liquid inside catching the faint light of the room.<br/><br/>As he held it up, the vial seemed to hum with a subtle energy, a testament to its powerful nature.<br/><br/>\"This Pure Essence Fluid is exactly what I need,\" he murmured, his voice filled with anticipation.<br/><br/>With a deep breath, Feng Chen brought the vial to his lips and drank the fluid in one smooth motion.<br/><br/>Instantly, a warm sensation spread through his body, invigorating every fiber of his being. The liquid was like a torrent of pure, spiritual essence, flowing through his meridians and dantian with incredible speed.<br/><br/>Previously, Feng Chen hadn't even heard about Pure Essence Fluid, but through the System, he knew of its effects.<br/><br/>First and foremost, it accelerated his cultivation speed, infusing his body with concentrated spiritual energy that would typically take weeks or even months to accumulate.<br/><br/>Every breath he took now felt richer, laden with the essence of the world itself.<br/><br/>As the fluid worked its magic, it began to purify his meridians and dantian, clearing out any residual impurities and smoothing the flow of energy within him.<br/><br/>The once-faint blockages in his energy pathways dissolved, making his cultivation more efficient and effective. It was as though his entire system had been cleaned and refreshed.<br/><br/>The restoration of vital energy was also one of its features. The exhaustion from hours of cultivating melted away, replaced by a renewed vigor.<br/><br/>Feng Chen could feel his strength being replenished, his stamina restored to its peak.<br/><br/>Most significantly, the Pure Essence Fluid was aiding in his breakthrough.<br/><br/>As his energy surged and the impurities were expelled, the barriers between his current realm and the Nascent Soul Realm seemed to thin.<br/><br/>The fluid provided the final push he needed to transcend his limitations and advance to the next level.<br/><br/>Feng Chen's physique also benefited from the fluid's effects. His muscles felt more robust, his senses sharper, and his endurance heightened.<br/><br/>The Pure Essence Fluid was not just a temporary boost but a long-lasting enhancement to his overall capabilities.<br/><br/>As the vial emptied, Feng Chen's aura began to glow with a brilliant light. The energy within him surged and stabilized, marking a significant step forward in his cultivation journey.<br/><br/>His eyes closed as he focused inward, feeling the profound changes coursing through his meridians and dantian.<br/><br/>With a determined expression, he whispered to himself, \"It's time. This breakthrough is within reach.\"<br/><br/>He gathered the concentrated energy and directed it towards the threshold separating the Three Elements Divine Realm from the Nascent Soul Realm.<br/><br/>His aura flared, enveloping him in a radiant light as he pushed against the barriers that had held him back.<br/><br/>\"The gap between realms will no longer stand in my way,\" he said with resolve. \"I am ready to step into the Nascent Soul Realm.\"<br/><br/>As the energy surged, Feng Chen's presence became overwhelming, the room illuminated by the brilliance of his aura.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Feng Chen had the foresight to prepare the Heavenly Veil Formation; otherwise, the entire Misty Vale City might have sensed the overwhelming aura he was emitting.<br/><br/>The barrier of the Three Elements Divine Realm began to crack under pressure, the resistance melting away as Feng Chen's energy surged through.<br/><br/>He could feel the transformation beginning his very essence aligning with the core of the Nascent Soul Realm.<br/><br/>With a final, decisive push, Feng Chen released the accumulated energy, and the last vestiges of the barrier gave way.<br/><br/>The sensation was like breaking through a dense fog into clear, open skies. As the barriers fell away, Feng Chen's entire being surged with vibrant energy, his aura exploding in a dazzling display of light and power.<br/><br/>His eyes snapped open, glowing with an intense brilliance, and a deep, resonant energy thrummed through him. The room vibrated with the newfound strength emanating from his<br/><br/>body.<br/><br/>With a voice that echoed like a thunderclap, he declared, \"I am Feng Chen of the Nascent Soul<br/><br/>Realm!\"<br/><br/>*******<br/><br/>\"Hey, Fu Zhen! Did you hear what happened at Feng Clan's banquet yesterday?\"<br/><br/>\"What? Did a war break out between the Feng Clan and the other Major Families?\"<br/><br/>\"No! But there was something much more interesting. Mystic Flame Sect had come to Feng<br/><br/>Clan.\"<br/><br/>\"Mystic Flame Sect!?

How could that trash deserve Miss Ling? It was the right decision.\"<br/><br/>\"However, it was Feng Yun who divorced Miss Ling and made a three-year promise that he would beat her at Dragon and Phoenix Competition.\"<br/><br/>\"How could Feng Yun be worthy of competing at the Dragon and Phoenix Competition?
