While there was no guarantee the treasure existed, it was worth exploring.<br/><br/>And while the System Store could provide him with any treasure he desired, those items came at a steep price in System Points.<br/><br/>Even if the treasure didn't exist, this would be a well-deserved break from his responsibilities - a rare chance to indulge in the wanderlust he'd long suppressed.<br/><br/>His steps were light, yet purposeful, as he made his way out of Misty Vale City and toward the Stormhowl Valley.<br/><br/>The journey was long, but for someone of Feng Chen's cultivation, it was nothing more than a minor inconvenience.<br/><br/>With his speed, the several-day trip would take him only a few hours. Along the way, he observed the changing landscape-lush forests giving way to rocky terrain, the sky above darkening as clouds gathered over the distant Stormhowl Valley.<br/><br/>The air grew colder as he neared the valley's edge. Lightning cracked across the darkened sky, casting fleeting shadows over the jagged cliffs.<br/><br/>Before reaching the valley itself, he spotted a small border town nestled between two jagged cliffs.<br/><br/>\"That should be Thundercrest Outpost!\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen muttered to himself.<br/><br/>The town's purpose was clear-it served as a final defense before the deadly wilderness of Stormhowl Valley.<br/><br/>Fortified walls surrounded the settlement, and watchtowers dotted the perimeter, with guards constantly scanning the horizon for any signs of approaching monsters.<br/><br/>Feng Chen checked their cultivation which was mostly in the Foundation Establishment Stage and some in the Core Formation Stage.<br/><br/>As Feng Chen drew closer, he noticed not only the presence of guards but also several cultivators who appeared to be mercenaries.<br/><br/>These individuals were hardened and battle-worn, likely making their living by hunting the powerful monsters that roamed the valley.<br/><br/>Their auras were sharp, each radiating the confidence of someone who had survived countless life-and-death battles.<br/><br/>Some were gathering supplies, while others sat around discussing recent hunts, exchanging tips and information on the best strategies to deal with the monsters resistant to lightning that dominated the valley.<br/><br/>There were also people sharing their recent experience in the Stormhowl Valley.

It was so big that I was about to pass out from just his presence.\"<br/><br/>\"You are lucky. If not for your stealth skill, you could have said bye-bye to your life.\" \"That's why I said to not go deeper into Stormhowl Valley. Do you know how many mercenaries lost their lives because of greed?\"<br/><br/>\"Haha... I will be careful from now on!\"<br/><br/>They were talking about life and death situations as if normal. Even if they knew just how dangerous their job was, they couldn't stop being mercenary as this was their livelihood.<br/><br/>The monsters they hunted provided valuable resources-rare materials, while there were also precious herbs and even treasures which is the reason Mercenaries risks their lives going into the Stormhowl Valley.<br/><br/>(I should collect some information about Stormhowl Valley and also about the area I am heading to!)<br/><br/>Feng Chen thought to himself.<br/><br/>Despite his status as a Nascent Soul Realm cultivator, he knew the importance of caution. Gathering information was a fundamental step in ensuring survival, regardless of one's power.<br/><br/>Even with his considerable strength, being well-informed would help him navigate the dangers of Stormhowl Valley more effectively and avoid unforeseen complications.<br/><br/>He approached a group seated near a stall selling drinks. With a friendly smile, he greeted them.<br/><br/>\"Greetings, friends. I'm Feng Chen, and I'm planning an excursion into Stormhowl Valley. Could you share some information with me?\"<br/><br/>The mercenaries eyed him with a mix of curiosity and skepticism. One of them, a burly man with a scar running down his cheek, looked him up and down.<br/><br/>\"You're heading into the Valley, huh? Not many folks do that without good reason.\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen nodded, taking out a small pouch of gold coins and placing it on the table.<br/><br/>\"I'm willing to pay for some information. Maybe a round of drinks on me as well.\"<br/><br/>The scarred man's eyes widened slightly at the sight of the gold and his companies were also smiling looking at the pouch of gold.<br/><br/>\"Well, that's quite generous of you. Alright, let's talk.\"<br/><br/>The mercenaries eagerly accepted the gold coins and the drinks. The group's atmosphere became more relaxed.<br/><br/>Feng Chen had encountered many mercenaries during his travels, and he knew that the best way to forge connections was through money and drinks.<br/><br/>Although showcasing his cultivation or even the Three Elements Divine Realm cultivation would do the trick, he didn't want to attract too much attention.<br/><br/>And well, it was just some gold coins only. He was rich enough to buy the whole bar and it wouldn't make a dent in his pocket.<br/><br/>\"First off, I'm Kong Wei,\" the scarred man introduced himself, taking a swig from his drink. \"Let me give you a rundown of what you're up against in Stormhowl Valley.\"<br/><br/>\"Is this your first time to Stormhowl Valley?\"<br/><br/>Kong Wei asked. Looking at Feng Chen's appearance, one could tell that he was a noble rather than someone like them who had a crude and messy appearance.<br/><br/>Feng Chen nodded.<br/><br/>\"Stormhowl Valley is as brutal as they say,\" Kong Wei began.<br/><br/>\"The weather's unforgiving, and the monsters are no joke. If you're lucky, you might come across a few Rank-2 beasts, but deeper in, you'll find Rank-4 and even Rank-5 monsters. They're stronger than the Three Elements Divine Realm and one should run at their sight.\" He took a swig of his drink, continuing, \"The key to surviving is to stay on the move and avoid getting cornered. Lightning strikes are frequent, and many monsters have adapted to it. If you can, avoid direct confrontation with them unless you're confident in your strength.\"<br/><br/>Another mercenary, a wiry woman with keen eyes, chimed in.<br/><br/>\"Also, keep an eye out for special herbs and dead bodies of monsters. They're valuable and can be sold or used to boost your cultivation. But don't get too greedy. They are often guarded<br/><br/>by powerful beasts!\"<br/><br/>Kong Wei nodded in agreement. Then he began to take out his Map of Stormhowl Valley and explain which area to avoid.<br/><br/>Feng Chen listened intently, taking mental notes.<br/><br/>Feng Chen then pointed to the location marked on the Treasure Map and asked Kong Wei.<br/><br/>\"I'm particularly interested in this region,\" Feng Chen said, trying to sound casual.<br/><br/>\"Do you know anything about it?\"<br/><br/>Kong Wei squinted in the direction Feng Chen indicated, then shook his head slowly.<br/><br/>\"That's a notorious part of the valley. It's known for its treacherous landscape and dangerous creatures. Few venture there unless they're looking for trouble.\"<br/><br/>The wiry woman again chimed in.<br/><br/>\"There are rumors that even a team of Grand Qi Condensation Realm Mercenaries has never<br/><br/>returned after going there. Therefore, almost all the mercenaries avoid that area. I suggest<br/><br/>you also avoid this area unless you want to die.\"<br/><br/>Hearing this, Feng Chen was excited rather than getting scared. If the area was this<br/><br/>dangerous, it could explain why Zhao's family never attempted to go look for it.<br/><br/>It could also mean that the chances of other people stumbling upon it are highly unlikely.<br/><br/>Kong Wei nodded in agreement.<br/><br/>\"The region is highly volatile due to frequent lightning storms and dangerous terrain. If you're set on exploring that part, you'd better be prepared for the worst. There are sightings<br/><br/>of Rank-5 and even Rank-6 monsters there.\"<br/><br/>\"Thanks for the advice. I'll keep all that in mind.\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen said as he prepared to leave.<br/><br/>As Feng Chen was going, Kong Wei added.<br/><br/>\"If you need a guide or more detailed information, come back here. We have connections and<br/><br/>can get you what you need.\"<br/><br/>Feng Chen nodded, appreciating the offer.<br/><br/>With that, he turned and walked towards the entrance of Thundercrest Outpost, the<br/><br/>knowledge he'd gathered giving him a clearer picture of what lay ahead.\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "images": {}, "success": true}
