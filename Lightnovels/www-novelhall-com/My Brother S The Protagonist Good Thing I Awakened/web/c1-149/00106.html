                <main><h1>Chapter 107 The Ice Fairy'S Dual Invitation</h1><div class="entry-content" id="htmlContent">
							Chapter 107  The Ice Fairy's Dual Invitation Feng Chen turned to Feng Mei, his gaze softening as he studied her expression. <br/><br/>"Mei'er, do you have any reservations about this arrangement? If there's anything you are uncertain of, now is the time to speak." <br/><br/>Feng Mei looked up at Feng Chen, her eyes reflecting a blend of gratitude and indecision. <br/><br/>While the thought of being personally trained by the legendary Ice Fairy was enticing, she was reluctant to leave her family and Feng Yun behind. <br/><br/>So, she couldn't make her decision without thinking for a few days and also asking Feng Yun about his opinion. <br/><br/>"Sect Leader Bing Xue's offer is… an honor," she admitted, her tone thoughtful. "It's what any cultivator would dream of. But…" She hesitated, glancing at Feng Yun, who didn't know what was happening in the Tianlong Mansion and was just concentrating on breaking the Rank-2 formation. "I can't make such a decision suddenly. I would be thankful if given a few days to think about this." <br/><br/>Bing Xue's expression softened as she listened. It was a relief that Feng Mei hadn't outright refused, indicating she would seriously consider the offer—unlike Yuan Ziyan, whose elders were rejected. <br/><br/>She believes that Feng Mei will undoubtedly realize that training with her would be good for her future. <br/><br/>Moreover, she wasn't planning to simply wait idly. Over the next few days, she would actively work to ensure that Feng Mei felt enthusiastic about joining their sect. <br/><br/>On the other hand, people who heard Feng Chen and Feng Mei's reply looked at them in shock. <br/><br/>If given the same opportunity, they would have eagerly complied with the Ice Fairy's every request. Not to mention, having their own talent become the Ice Fairy's personal disciple would bring immense benefit to them. <br/><br/>The girls were clearly envious and jealous, yet at the same time, they couldn't understand Feng Mei's hesitation. The Ice Fairy was an idol for every cultivator, especially young women, and they would do anything to gain the chance to become her disciple. <br/><br/>Now that such an opportunity was knocking at her door, instead of eagerly accepting and showing gratitude, she said she needed time to think. <br/><br/>What was there to think? They don't know just what was going through the head of Feng Clan. The elder didn't urge the young to accept, and the young hesitated without clear reason. <br/><br/>"Very well, Feng Mei." Bing Xue replied gently. "Take the time you need to consider it fully." <br/><br/>She paused, shifting her focus briefly to Feng Chen before continuing. "The Icy Veil Sect values sincerity and commitment above all, and I trust you will make the decision that's best for you." <br/><br/>Then, with an air of quiet authority, she redirected her attention to Feng Chen, her eyes brightening slightly. "In fact, I also wish to extend an invitation to Feng Xiaoyu." She said, her gaze shifting toward Feng Xiaoyu. <br/><br/>This second announcement stirred another wave of surprise. Many in the audience exchanged stunned looks, and murmurs filled the room as they realized the Icy Veil Sect was not only interested in Feng Mei but also targeting another Feng clan talent. <br/><br/>They could understand Feng Mei as she was a talent that any sect would die for but Feng Xiaoyu? <br/><br/>While her talent was certainly impressive and valuable, it typically wouldn't attract attention from a sect like the Icy Veil. <br/><br/>Bing Xue continued, "While Feng Xiaoyu may not join as my personal disciple, rest assured, she will receive guidance from our sect's finest elders. We would provide her with every opportunity to cultivate her talent and reach her fullest potential." "Under the Icy Veil's mentorship, she would receive a level of training that could pave the way for greatness. She might also have the chance to become one of the elders in the future." <br/><br/>Feng Chen considered this offer, glancing briefly toward Feng Xiaoyu, who had been observing the exchange with interest. Feng Xiaoyu's eyes widened at the thought of training under the famed elders of the Icy Veil Sect. She hadn't anticipated receiving an invitation herself. While it wasn't the same as Feng Mei's, it was still an invitation from the Icy Veil Sect Leader herself.  Searᴄh the nôvel_Fire.ηet website on Google to access chapters of novels early and in the highest quality.<br/><br/>But in a similar manner as Feng Mei, she couldn't just agree as she also needed time to think about it. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the bystanders watched the scene unfold in a mixture of awe and envy. Many girls felt an undeniable pang of jealousy, wondering how the Feng clan had managed to garner so much interest from a sect as renowned as the Icy Veil. The Ice Fairy's words about training Feng Mei personally and now offering to mentor Feng Xiaoyu left them marveling—and fuming—at the good fortune of the Feng family. <br/><br/>On the other hand, while the Icy Veil Sect certainly valued Feng Xiaoyu's talent, they had an additional motive by inviting Feng Xiaoyu. <br/><br/>By inviting another member of Feng Mei's clan, they hoped Feng Mei would feel more inclined to join them, easing any worries of isolation and fostering a sense of belonging within the sect. <br/><br/>Of course, even if Feng Mei didn't join but Feng Xiaoyu joined, they have no problem. Feng Xioayu was also talented enough to be nurtured by them. <br/><br/>"Feng Clan Leader," Bing Xue said with a respectful nod. "If you will allow it, the Icy Veil Sect is prepared to cultivate both of these exceptional young women to become the best versions of themselves. We are deeply invested in nurturing their unique talents." Feng Chen thought for a while and was also surprised although he could also guess their reason. <br/><br/>In any case, this was a good opportunity for Xiaoyu as well but he also wanted to leave the decision in her hand. <br/><br/>If both were to go, that was also a good choice as they could keep each other company and would feel lonely. <br/><br/>"What do you think, Xiaoyu'er?" <br/><br/>Feng Chen glanced at Xiaoyu, his expression calm. He didn't want to pressure her into thinking that he wanted her to join them and that it would benefit their clan. <br/><br/>What he wants for them is to think about what is best for themselves and what they want to do. <br/><br/>As for the clan, with him present, there was no cause for concern. After all, if he couldn't even manage that for them, he would be too ashamed to admit that he was a transmigrator with a System. <br/><br/>"Xiaoyu'er, what do you think of this offer? It's an opportunity for growth, but the decision is yours to make. You need to consider what's best for you and your own path." <br/><br/>Feng Xiaoyu glanced at the Icy Veil Sect elders and then back at Bing Xue, who was observing her with poised patience. "Sect Leader Bing Xue's invitation is truly an honor," Xiaoyu began, her voice respectful but steady. "It's beyond what I ever expected, but I'd also like a few days to consider it fully before deciding." <br/><br/>The room fell silent as her words hung in the air. The audience exchanged bewildered glances, their expressions mirroring the shock and disbelief of those around them. The Feng Clan was given a once-in-a-lifetime chance to send not one but two of its young talents to train with the legendary Icy Veil Sect—and yet, they both wanted 'time to think'? <br/><br/>It was almost inconceivable. <br/><br/>Many among the crowd couldn't help but shake their heads, muttering in amazement. ( The Feng Clan's brains must be wired differently ) <br/><br/>Many of them started to have such thoughts. After all, a typical person would have eagerly accepted the first offer, let alone the second one, which was even more advantageous. <br/><br/>Bing Xue, however, remained calm, perhaps getting rejected twice wasn't as shocking as the first time. She nodded approvingly, her gaze shifting between Feng Mei and Feng Xiaoyu with a hint of admiration. <br/><br/>Today, she faced rejection not just once but twice—more than she experienced in her lifetime. Yet, she didn't feel anger or negativity; instead, she found herself liking them even more. She was pleased to see that they were giving her offers serious consideration, though she would undoubtedly be happier if they ultimately accepted her proposal. <br/><br/>"Very well, Feng Xiaoyu. Take all the time you need. The Icy Veil Sect values thoughtful decisions, and we'll await yours along with Feng Mei." <br/><br/>Feng Xiaoyu nodded respectfully, lost in deep thought. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Grand Elder Feng Zhenshan and Feng Zhilan couldn't stop smiling. Good things had been happening ever since they had come to Eastern Gathering despite their unlucky encounter with the Bai Clan at first. <br/><br/>Not only did they make friends with the Yuan Clan but now one of the Top 3 strongest Sect also wanted to recruit their descendants which would only make their clan have more allies. <br/><br/>Although they wanted Feng Mei and Feng Xiaoyu to accept Ice Fairy's invitation, they also respected their decision. <br/><br/>Moreover, they also believed that with their talent, even if they didn't join Icy Veil Sect, they would soar in the future. <br/><br/>Either way, they were very proud of their descendants!						</div></main>
